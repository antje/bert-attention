0	-1	Intuit's changes in this product are sneaky and ham-handed.  After purchasing TurboTax Deluxe this year, as I have for at least two decades, I found that the handling of stock transactions has been moved to the higher-priced &#34;Premier&#34; product.  I will now have to mail it back for a refund.  Had TurboTax informed us long-time users of this change I would have been spared this extra trouble.  And now I will look for a different product at a more reasonable price than &#34;Premier.&#34;  This is really a dumb way for Intuit to treat customers.
1	-1	Quicken 2014 is unstable and crashes often.  (This is documented on their support website.)  Technical support offers minimal &#34;temporary&#34; fixes that have failed to eliminate the crashes.  Also, some basic functionality has gone backwards vs. the 2012 version, while there have been minor improvements.  Overall, I wish I had not upgraded and waited until they cured their quality problems.  Note:  I have been using Quicken since it was first released.  This is the only poor quality upgrade experience I have had and am mightily disappointed.  All that said, I'm still using the software and hopeful that they will release patches that will fix the problems.
2	1	After running Quickbooks in Windows for many years, the switch to Mac OS was flawless. Plus, the Mac interface is cleaner, easier to work with.
3	-1	Are you kidding me?<br />Let's start from the beginning. The loading screen is a JPG that was blown up by a factor of about 500%.<br /><br />The labels on the fields on the very first forms don't line up with the fields themselves, so I would have to count from the top to see what each field was.<br /><br />Actually ... that's enough; I wrote more polished software when I was 15. And I'm supposed to trust my tax return to software of this quality? I'd bet $50 that at some point, this nonreturnable trash is going to add 1 + 1 and get 11, and then I'm going to get audited.<br /><br />No thank you.
4	1	Easy to download and use.  Came with free federal files.  I use to do my small business taxes and this seems to get me the most refund back.
5	1	Have used this for 10 years.  So easy to  use and have had only limited problems over the years. would use again
6	0	Helps do your taxes, although I wish they provided a multi state version. My taxes require at least 3 states.
7	1	This program can get glitchy after the intermediate level. Sometimes it's fine, other times it's not. No rhyme or reason. I just set up a new user rather than trying deal with it.
8	1	Any other of upgrading using a clean install takes days or forever.  This took all of 5 minutes. two words
9	0	Quality of this product is diminishing over time. Have used since it was tax cut. Probably give<br />turbo tax a try next year.
10	-1	Amazed at the fact that my 2010 Quicken locked up on me until I downloaded the 2013 Quicken.  Then, everything worked well.  Inasmuch as I never used any online help, I was disappointed with having to puchase 2013. I am not into the bells and whistles and  really just keep our records for reconciliation.
11	1	Takes the lawyer out of simple will preparation.  Easy to use.  prepared wills and heath care documents for myself and my wife.
12	-1	Previously I used Microsoft Money for our personal finances, and I loved it.  We purchased a new computer so I decided to download Quicken Starter Edition 2011 to track our personal finances.  What a mistake!  This software is useless unless all you care about it your checkbook balance and credit card balances.  There is ZERO options for loan balances or asset balances.  SERIOUSLY?  Who doesn't have some type of loan?  And some people DO have a retirement account they would like to track.  What a waste of my $29.99!!  Buyer beware!  Splurge for the deluxe edition or find better software.
13	0	After using TurboTax for over a dozen years I got fed up with their constant money grab and decided to try an alternative.  My tax situation is moderately complex with an LLC, multiple properties, and other investment activities.  With the TT products I was forced to by their most expensive personal product plus the business product plus the state business product, all in nearly $300.  With H&R I got everything I need and more for about 15% of the TT cost.  The H&R business product is a bit clunky and the interview is fairly weak, TT's is only marginally better so it seems neither company puts much energy into their business products.  Also, there is no import with H&R business so I had to enter everything from scratch, not a huge deal but annoying nonetheless.  On the personal side the H&R product is much better but not up to the level of refinement as the TT products, I'd say it's ~85% of the way there.  If the products were closer in price there'd be no comparison, TT is easier to use.  But, and this is a big but, the TT products are NOT worth over $200 more than H&R's products.  For that reason, I will try H&R again next year.  Also, the promise of a local office for help and the included audit protection are nice benefits that TT cannot touch.
14	0	Doing your taxes with Tax Act is easy. What made me mad is you have to pay 14.99 for the State, which is fine, but at the end when you it is time to e-file your state, you have to pay an extra $9.99  to file your state. Granted this program is cheaper then the rest, at first, But you end up paying the same. In general I only paid 1 cent less this year for my state then I paid last year. At least with Turbo Tax, I knew up front the total cost. So this will teach me.
15	1	This fits my purpose to a tee. Works as advertized
16	-1	I have been using this over the past year and I was going to upgrade to 2014 but I see that that version has the same bugs and more.  I need to simply display Schedule E reports for my properties and as soon as I have it display one property, it crashes.  That is why I use this program.  For the reports so I don't have to use manual paper ledgers and calculators and stuff.  WTH?  I have reinstalled the program, used old backups where I had to key in over 6 months of data (it stops crashing on those backups) and then when I go to view my report, BANG.  I was able to tolerate previous crashes but this is crazy.  I am not spending over $100 for a new program that is as unreliable as the old ones.  Support keeps telling me to go to old back ups.  Support has no idea what is going on and cannot fix it.  You folks do know that this is TAX PREP TIME, right?  I have until the 31st of January to get my reports out to the respective shareholders.  Looks like MS Excel is going to have to do them.  After some 20 plus years of software, you figure that when we point and click on things it would work.  I was going to give 2 stars but I'm so frustrated and the other programs out there are just as bad in their own special way.  One star it is.  If I am going to waste money on something time after time after knowing it is bad, I might as well start smoking and drinking and driving really fast cars.<br /><br />PS - As I have seen with other bad reviews, do not give me the email for support again.  I have used it.  No one can fix my report issue.  Don't give me lip service and say you will look into it.  You won't.  I worked tech support for 20 years from software to hardware companies and it is all lies.  If you give me guidance, be truthful and sincere.
17	-1	I was a late adopter because it infuriated me that I was required to upgrade to still get access to my bank and credit card accounts.  By that time Quicken had come out with version 12 because of all the problems already mentioned on this site and others.  So I started the upgrade and got hung up on the conversion of historic stock prices.  The Intuit service team, over in India, was not helpful.  There is better help in the online forums. Anyway, had to delete my stock price history and reinstall the last five years.  For my stocks I had earlier, I imported prices from Yahoo Finance.  I have not tried the mobile feature yet because of all the other problems.  I finally got it working and do not want to mess things up.  Now that Quicken basically has a monopoly in this area, they must feel they can force you to buy their upgrade every three years with all of its problems.  A sorry state of affairs.
18	0	What a frustrating tool. Beyond being crash-prone, it's over-featured. It works so hard to &#34;intelligently&#34; (hack, cough) guess the screen area you wish to capture, that it's unusable for key purposes, like capturing a PowerPoint presentation. Once the PPT is running as a slide show, you can no longer adjust the capture area. The only option is to set for a full screen capture, and deal with the resulting letter box effect.<br /><br />I found a cheap screen capture alternative (Movavi) that lets me set a capture area, and persist it even when the PPT starts to run. Problem solved, since I'm using Adobe PP for editing anyhow.
19	0	Again, less product for more the money.  I don't get it.... All you MAC lovers line up at the gas pump to save $1.50 on cheep gas and you have no problem spending 5 times the value of the computer, 2x the price of software, and receive 1/2 the software compared to PC.  Only logical answer is that you own AAPL in your portfolio
20	0	"Major installation problems on 64 bit version of Windows 7.  No support from Intuit.  Others have asked about similar installation problems on their forum but there are no replies.  Intuit has tax support but NO visible software support.  There is no phone number to call.  They only have an area to type a question to see if there is an answer.  As if 3/31/2014 there is no solution posted.<br /><br />This same machine has had no problems with 2011, 2012 TurboTax installations.<br /><br />I un-installed and re-installed four times and got the same error crash when the software attempts to open.  There is a posted fix if you get a Windows XP error on a Windows 7 machine but I found no other fixes.  Two weeks before the tax deadline and this software can't even open to file an extension let alone let me file my simple return.<br /><br />Update April 8, 2014:<br />The problem opening up a new TurboTax form has been solved.  It is related to the fact that TurboTax had a problem when Microsoft update of March of 2013 was installed.  The update number is KB2670838.  In my case, the update in and of itself did not cause the problem.  It did however change the way PNG files were opened and viewed.  TurboTax requires Windows Picture Viewer to open PNG files.  I had an overlay program called FastPictureViewer installed to view RAW files from Canon and Nikon cameras.  I temporarily uninstalled this program and TurboTax worked fine.  Others on the Internet have also removed the Microsoft update KB2670838 with success.  Since I was able to now complete my taxes, I changed my rating from one to three stars.  Intuit gets dinged two stars for their lack of support on this issue.  After solving the problem I was able to find a very recent post (April 1) with an obscure title at Intuit (TurboTax) wherein they state:<br />\\"".....additionally we have found that the FastPictureViewer codecs may be interfering with this. Uninstalling or updating FastPictureViewer if it is installed on yoursystem should resolve the error.\\"""
21	1	Over the past five years I've switched from, IO Bit's Advanced SystemCare 7 to Avira and now to  Avast!  Why? Because avast is not not cluttered with bloat-ware, it doesn't have annoying advertising,  it doesn't use up my system resources and slow down my machine, and most importantly, I haven't been infected with any malicious software since installing it two years ago.<br /><br />Cheers
22	0	Pictures looked fine. Program is just too much trouble to work with............. I found the controls and methods of choice for printing pictures overwhelming.
23	-1	I have been using TurboTax since it started as MacInTax and now I to will be leaving this greedy company. Bye.
24	1	I just love my free Avast. its help so much.
25	1	No problems with my computers since I installed Norton 360 2years ago. It even cleaned up my other computers that had problems right down to the kernel. I tried others but not with same results. Well worth the money.
26	1	Old news, now.  But I keep re-upping.
27	0	This is a old version.<br />You'll must pay more for upgrade. So why do you buy new version with good price?
28	0	The download was fairly simple and straight forward.  When starting a new return, Importing a`2013 TurboTax return failed with H&R Block encountered a problem and had to close.  Neither simple or complex TurboTax returns could be imported.  I'm still satisfied with the IRS schedules that are included in the H&R Deluxe edition but will need to enter ALL base data rather than importing it from TurboTax..
29	-1	This is not running well on my computer. very glitchy
30	1	Very easy to work with.
31	1	"The main program remains very similar to the Quicken 2012 version I upgraded from.  The main reason I updated was for the Quicken 2014 App.  It has not disappointing and worked very well.  I now have an easy \\""on the go\\"" option for both me (primary budget tracker for our house) and my wife to add spending in real time to our checking account register.  My wife is adding her own transactions to the register now vs me doing it from the bank software or via receipt.  This is a big plus.  I like the ability to snap a receipt copy if desired and attach to the transaction.  This is nice for taxes and warranty type purchases.<br /><br />The investment section of the software still leaves a lot to be desired.  The lack of a robust Mac offering still remains a problem.  My preference is the Mac platform but I have access to a PC and use Quicken on the PC until they come out with a real Mac version.<br /><br />Summary - Unless you really care about the smartphone app functionality you may be disappointed with this update."
32	-1	Totally missed the state sales tax deduction. I will not use it next year.
33	1	Quicken is as good as ever. Didn't need the upgrade but was losing the ability to download transactions. I'd like to know how much it costs Intuit to allow online access to my banking.
34	1	I like this product. I'm able to sync all my accounts and loans. Great for tracking spending/saving/retirement.
35	1	If I had seen all these negative reviews before I started doing my taxes, I might have been worried needlessly.  I had absolutely no problems<br />with either my federal or state returns.  Some of the things I did that may have improved my situation were:<br /><br />1.  I have a Mac PC which may give better results than the Windows PC TurboTax version.<br /><br />2.  I downloaded updates whenever an update was available.  Thus I was always using the latest TurboTax version.
36	1	IT DIDNT INCLUDE SCHEDULE C FORMS I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND I HOPE THAT THEY INCLUDE SCH.S IN THE DELUXE VERSION NEXT YEAR
37	1	Hassle free, few conflicts, good detection rate, and light on resources. It'd be hard to find a better free antivirus.
38	0	I'm still a frustrated former MS Money user. Not sure what is supposed to be so great about this &#34;upgrade&#34;.
39	-1	Like other reviewers, I have been using Adobe products for a long time.  I am not a graphics professional so I have learned certain ways of getting done what I need to do, and the whole Creative Cloud idea of continual upgrades is NOT an advantage for someone like me, who doesn't have time to learn something new every time I need to build a graphic.  Thanks to other reviewers for confirming my suspicions about the Creative Cloud, I have bought a CS6 license to upgrade my CS5.5, and I'm going to stay with this as long as I can.  If I ever am forced to abandon CS6 products, I will look for other solutions (not Adobe) for my needs.<br /><br />Adobe, are you paying attention?  I've told you essentially this same thing in every survey you've sent me, and I see here that many others agree with me.  Do you care?
40	0	A lot of pops and a little slow
41	-1	With Sony Sound Forge Pro 10 you can do only one truck which is toy, not real music software. This is intentionally missed in the description of the DAW. My money gone thru the window, thank you very much!
42	0	I have used Turbo Tax for years, but I thought H&R Block would be less expensive. H&R Block program did not work well with last year's Turbo Tax as others had stated. I am in an different situation as I needed an additional state program. The extra cost was expected, but cost more than I had previously paid with TT and I paid a fee to file the extra state also, the total was just over $60 extra.<br /><br />H&R Block was ok, some parts of the program were easy to use and some weren't.
43	0	"Edit: I dropped the score from 4 to 3 based on a new, much bigger problem. Last night, 6/23/2014, while typing out a paper for school, my monitor went blank, then blue. I received the message that I had a Kernal Data Inpage Error that caused the computer to crash, go to a BSOD and required about 2 hours of work to fix. The first fixes was to check my hard drive for failure, then check my RAM, both were working fine. So I had to then go into my minidump. I knew nothing about this, but an online technician went through the dump file (.dmp) and found that something with Norton had caused this error. I removed Norton immediately and installed Kaspersky, since it runs fine on my work computer which is also Windows 8.1. So far, no problems. Please read on since I do like Norton products and have trusted them throughout the years. Everything I can see is that it just doesn't work well with Windows 8.1.<br /><br />*Original review below*<br />I've bought Norton religiously from Amazon since 2008. I didn't hesitate to buy NIS 2014 this year and now I'm sort of regretting it. I will go ahead and say I gave it four stars because it works on my wife's computer (Windows 7) and our daughter's computer (Windows 7). So I'm averaging the score out with their experiences being a 5 and mine being a 2.<br /><br />The basics: If you've ever downloaded Norton or any other software from Amazon, you know what to expect, I've never once had a problem with Amazon's downloads. It's fast, cheaper and painless. If you haven't ever downloaded it and are curious about the advantages/disadvantages, just go ahead and download it. When you download and install the new version with your product key, the software automatically creates a folder in your documents with a record of your product key. If you lose that and need to reinstall it, it's okay, Amazon has the product key in your history. Without these, I would buy the physical disc version in case I needed to reinstall it. But I promise you, if you have any concerns about not having the physical disc, don't have them.<br /><br />So why would I only rate it a 2 on my laptop? I don't know who to blame. I was running NIS 2014 fine on Windows 8, then Windows 8.1 came along. Then came the problems. These are fairly detailed descriptions of the problems and fixes for them, if you can call these \\""fixes\\"".<br />First problem: Norton's interface stops working. I would get these warnings from Norton, \\""Your computer has not been scanned\\"". I would go check and sure enough, Norton hadn't ran a scan in a week. I would click \\""quick scan\\"" nothing happens, click \\""full scan\\"" nothing happens, so I headed over to Norton's support forum and posted my problem. The first quick fix was to manually schedule a scan. Tried that, but no scan happened. Went back, was told to uninstall Norton and download the newest version, then reinstall (See why Amazon keeping my product key on record is nice?). This fixed it...for a week. Same problem pops up the next week. I go back to Norton and they told me to download this other fix software called, \\""Norton remove and reinstall\\"", or as they call it RnR. This software does make the remove and reinstall process much easier since you just run it, it does the removing, then on reinstall, it inserts your product key for you, thanks, I think. This problem has not stopped. I have now went through this process 7 times. I'm assured by Norton that it doesn't mean Norton isn't working. I'm assured my computer is still protected, but something with the menu interface is messing up. I was also told to remove Super Anti-Spyware and Maleware Bytes, so I did though not without a fight, it didn't fix the problem. So those went back on my laptop.<br /><br />I've had this version for about 4 months, so 7 reinstalls is way more than I should have. I have only had to reinstall Norton, in previous years, when switching to a new computer.<br /><br />I have learned to deal with this problem, but now I'm getting a 3048,3error from Norton. It gives no other information and gives me a link to Norton's support forum. Alright Norton, if you were an employee, you would be fired. Their \\""fix\\""? Go back to the download Norton Removal Tool, fresh reinstall, enter product key, sign back in to Norton. I have only had this error once, but that's now 8 times this software has had problems in 4 months.<br /><br />However, as mentioned earlier, neither my wife or daughter are having any problems. All evidence points at Windows 8.1 as the problem, but on the other hand, why can't Norton fix the problem with their software? So I'm placing equal blame on both Windows and Norton. I'm seriously considering looking for another security suite to use with my laptop. You can tell me, \\""It's still protected\\"" all you want, but I am tired of reinstalling, using Norton Removal Tool and Norton Remove and Reinstall. So, if you're running Windows 8 or lower, I would gladly recommend this as it's fast, it's updating definitions fast and it works like the last 4 years did, if you're using Windows 8.1, you might want to Google search, \\""Windows 8.1 issues with Norton Internet Security 2014\\"". And I can't say I recommend it to those with Windows 8.1.error from Norton. It gives no other information and gives me a link to Norton's support forum. Alright Norton, if you were an employee, you would be fired. Their \\""fix\\""? Go back to the download Norton Removal Tool, fresh reinstall, enter product key, sign back in to Norton. I have only had this error once, but that's now 8 times this software has had problems in 4 months.<br /><br />However, as mentioned earlier, neither my wife or daughter are having any problems.

44	0	The Federal version of this product is easy to complete.  The State version was not as simple.  It does not pull all of the necessary Federal information into it.
45	-1	This program has a huge flaw with respect to stocks and investments. If you are like me and have a managed investment account that has a lot of small transactions, this program will import your 1099-B statement electronically (as it should) but then will force you to go through each line item on that statement individually to verify it. This is tedious, and takes about 5-10 seconds per item to click through the requisite number of screens. I've already been at it for more than 2 hours and am not even halfway done. There are literally hundreds of items.<br /><br />I trust my broker to have entered the correct form on the 1099-B, and if she hasn't, I certainly don't know what the correct information is. But this program won't let me proceed without verifying this in the most painstaking way possible. TurboTax was never this tedious. I'd sooner pay more not to have to do this.
46	-1	Intuit has promised people like me - who were forced to switch from TurboTax Deluxe to TurboTax Premium because Turbotax Deluxe no longer handles investments - that we can have a $25 rebate this year because they made a mistake in not clarifying that Deluxe will not do the job for us. (The rebate is for this year only, mind you.Reading between the lines, it seems that Intuit is trying to &#34;educate&#34; investors that they will have to  buy Turbotax Premium from now on. Once the education year is over, the price rise will apparently stick.)<br /><br />Here is where you are supposed to be able to get the rebate: https://turbotax.intuit.com/25back. However, when I applied for the rebate, I found I could not get it - not yet anyway. It took a while, but I finally found out that you have to file electronically with this software, and only then can you apply for the rebate. This is not clear on the rebate site, and the FAQ link brings you to questions about how to file taxes, not how to get the rebate.<br /><br />Another heads up is that the rebate application deadline is April 20. So if you file your taxes on April 15th, you have five days to apply for the rebate.
47	-1	It is known by turbo tax but they do not tell you in advance the if you are transferring from HR Block 2011 and have used Schedules A,B,or D the income will not transfer in correctly..  I sent the request for a refund to turbotax but have not receive any response as of yet.  I downloaded HR Block Deluxe and all works well
48	-1	Have used Quicken for many years in business and for personal checking. Now retired, I updated from 2010 to 2013 because their email indicated that if I didn't, I would no longer be able to download records from financial institutions, so I bought it. What a disaster. After conversion via download, the program worked so slowly it was barely usable. Printing a check took many minutes. The program actually changed a scheduled payee to N/A no matter how many times I corrected it. I spent many hours over several days with two very patient oversea technicians, the last of which had me delete and reinstall. I was told I could go back to 2010 program but would lose all my records dating back to 1993. After deleting all temp files and other actions to clean and speed up PC, it still gives me response problems. Don't update to this unless you enjoy being frustrated.<br /><br />2/27/13 Follow up:  As it turns out unknown to me at the time, the day I downloaded Quicken, my PC was failing. After all of the frustration, I soon discovered that all of my installed programs were now running slow. Then one day the Desktop HP PC would not run at. The bottom line is upon replacing the tower all runs smoothly now. Mea Culpa. I must change the review to 3 stars because there are still issues.
49	-1	Bye, bye, Power Pivot in Excel.<br /><br />If you are a working professional looking for a copy that is usable for the family and serviceable enough for you or your kids to learn or brush upon Business Intelligence approaches in Excel, forget about this version AND skip the university version.<br /><br />Power Pivot used to be free as an add-in for all under Office 2010.  Those days are no longer.  Only Excel Standalone and Business Pro subscriptions may use PowerPivot.<br /><br />These new subscription based limitations will ultimately drive consumers away.  Already, many schools across America are flocking to Google Drive and Apps.  We will not renew with MS.
50	-1	2015 is my 20th year using Quicken through 8 versions. QD2015 reinforces the rule: never upgrade to a newer version of Quicken unless you either have to or can get it free. QD2015 is typical – it adds a few new calculations for managing/reporting assets and investments and that’s about it for improvements. You have to run five patches right out of the box, but it still has bugs and flaws that users have been complaining about on the forums for three or four previous versions. There are minor but irritating arbitrary changes; for instance “Find” has been taken off the register screen and put on a drop down menu where it is less convenient to access. “Find” is still very limited in flexibility and ease of use. The reports run fast, but there is still very limited in selecting filters, columns, and print layout. Even though you can’t change much, that little is very inconvenient to change. All in all it’s what we have come to expect from a company that has grown very complacent and pays little attention to user input because it has no serious competition. If you can, I recommend holding the Quicken version you have until it won’t run any more.
51	1	Easy download , be sure you have your amazon downloader set up .<br />Much less expensive than buying the disc and its saved in your amazon account with activation key.<br />The software is very good but doesnt slow down my computer much .
52	0	I was excited about finding OpenOffice as I was trying not to put the money out to purchase Microsoft Office. I feel with the word processor for documents  it would be fine. However while trying to produce slide presentations and save them  as .ppt or produce in OpenOffice and modify them in PowerPoint, I found that I had too many issues. I had problems such as large amounts of data and graphics just not being translated from one format to another. I am sure if you were producing your own products and did not have to make a lot of changes under another format you'd be fine.
53	1	Works well except already needs a patch like all computer items it seems. Still having trouble setting up the patch download after many attempts. Had an older version and I like some of the organizational items better then my older version. Needed to update due to laptop doesn't have a DVD/CD drive.
54	-1	Can't even find the program to install it after downloading it.  Taxcut sent out discs; use those instead if you want the program.
55	0	I love having excel again, way better than works. But I have a new computer and this program runs so slow that it is almost useless!
56	-1	Been  interfering with my Email(AOL)Ebay,Facebook,Amazon,various game's  (one of which being D2)  just way too  invasive and interfering
57	-1	I have windows 8 and I am not able to download it. I tried getting help from Amazon but could not. I tried to get a refund but was told they do not refund these games.
58	0	It will download my bank transactions fine, but will not update the online balance.  I have sent in my question to their help line, but have not received a reply.<br /><br />If they can fix this problem. then I will rate again.
59	0	Let me start off by saying I just purchased my new MBP about two months ago and I switched over from a PC to MAC. I had quicken 2006 and was very happy with it, so I decided to take the plunge since I had a new computer to purchase this product. I was not too impressed about some of the features that I was used to, for example the end of the year feature and reconciliation is a beast to perform, I guess you have to get used to it. To be honest if I could've stayed with 2006 quicken version I would have. I do like the mobile feature about 2015. So this version is just okay for me, really nothing to write home about ,borderline 2 1/2 stars.
60	1	I've used AVAST for about 1 year.  Got tired of paying.  I've had absolutely NO PROBLEMS!  Doesn't do everything, but is a great Antivirus.
61	-1	I bought this from a reseller on Amazon, and it was shipped to me on a DVD disc in January 2013. The program would not operate correctly. Once installed, it would not update, recipe searches returned no results, and it would not capture recipes from the internet as promised. After several interactions with support trying to download an installation file, which turned out to be a problem with their server, the owner finally got in touch with me and manually updated the program, which fixed all of the problems except one, it would still not update to the latest version. Then I bought a club membership, which gives you access to a free cookbook once a month. I kept having trouble downloading and integrating the cookbook into the program. This has happened twice out of five cookbook transactions, however on a couple of the other purchases/freebies I ended up having to retry several times to download the cookbooks and integrate them into the program. The first time total failure support got back to me and said the online file was corrupted and they had to fix it. This took a couple of weeks, but I was finally able to download the cookbook and integrate it into the program. The second time it happened I got no response from support for either the cookbook problem or the update problem. When updated manually the version was 10.5.2, the latest version is 10.6.<br /><br />I have spent too much time dealing with problems on this program to make it worthwhile.It is easier to just find a recipe, cut and past it into Word, and then file it and print it as necessary.
62	0	Just downloaded the program.  Description says will keep legal parameters updated through 2015 but during install it says product support ends December 31, 2014.  Hope they get any bugs sorted out by then.    *** Program was updated Nov. 7, 2014.
63	0	I've been using windows versions for many years, but wanted to get away from needing to use Parallels on my Mac to run Quicken.  Program seems to work great now that I finally got the old file converted.  Conversion app would not work at all on Windows XP running on Parallels, nor could I get it to work on a different Mac running Windows 8.1 thru Parallels.  I spent many hours trying various options for saving files to different directories, etc. in Parallels and nothing seemed to work.  I was just about to give up and ask for a refund.  Finally tried on a PC laptop running Windows 7 and it worked like a charm.  Intuit really needs better online support for the conversion program - such as which versions of windows you need to use it, and maybe some work-arounds for other versions. Perhaps its not even possible to convert on a Mc running Parallels?? Would have been a lot higher rating if conversion worked the first time I tried!
64	-1	Do not buy this product -- it will not work with all banks and the set-up is very limited in accounts and is not report or user friendly. I feel I was taken for $45!!!
65	1	I have Microsoft Works and it can run a load on my computer. This software has everything a student could want and it is absolutely free. Check it out. It even has applications that can be added for enhancement.
66	-1	Quicken forces you to buy new software after a set number of years, they will turn off your online access unless you update. They used to be a great company that offered worthwhile improvements with each new version, now they sell the same thing in a new wrapper. I have been a user from the early Windows versions from over ten years ago. They basically dump on their customers as they are the only game in town. Bring back Microsoft Money or any reasonable competitor and it would be adios, muchachos, to Quicken
67	1	as expected
68	0	"Most of the problems with this software have been mentioned already. I am reviewing here to add specific notes about using Quicken in a Parallels virtual machine (VM) running windows inside of a Mac. Since I have converted to Mac and since Intuit refuses to make a robust version of quicken for the Mac (the Mac version is especially lacking on the investment tools), I continue to run the windows version, which requires that I use Windows on my Mac too. For me, and apparently many other reviewers, this is the best of both worlds. However, my warning is that when I installed this into Windows 7 Professional (via bootcamp, even before any issues with the VM come into play), I got false error messages about low screen resolution and about my windows OS not being XP or later. The solution was to continue with the install, OK'ing and stumbling through the warnings. After it's done, right click the program icon, go to properties, go to compatibility, and set it for windows 7. If you don't do this it will either fail to run or it will run, but not be visible on your desktop. There might also be issues with whether you check \\""run as administrator\\"" in the properties of the icon. I got an error message about that too so I made sure that was not checked, but I am an administrator level user already, which the program seems to require. In other words you must be an admin to run it but not set the program to pretend everybody is. Anyway, for me this was all too annoying so I returned the product and went back to my 2014 version which basically has all the same features and annoying glitches but didn't cost me extra. I was willing to pay for the upgrade if Intuit had cleaned up their code and modernized the program and installation settings. Since they haven't, it had nothing to offer me. But if you are using a much older version then the upgrade as well as the hoops you have to jump through to install it are probably worth it. As a friend of mine likes to say, \\""it might cost a lot, but at least it's really hard to install\\"""
69	1	Basically a good program which gets easier with multiple uses. If there is a problem, however, it's tricky getting &#34;into&#34; the forms and to figure out how a particular figure was arrived at.
70	0	no other choice really. no major improvements from 2014. i hate intuit for various reasons.
71	1	The download and installation were pain-free. Amazon had a better price than Norton's own proprietary website, so it was a no-brainer on purchasing it here. Easy-to-use interfaces and everything one would come to expect from a decent virus protection suite; however, it's not particularly fond of its interaction with Google Chrome. There are frequent software crashes when browsing different websites. I also am not too happy with the way they changed the format and look of the identity safe application. The setup is almost as ridiculous and unnecessary as the debacle that is Windows 8. Note to software development heads: &#34;If it ain't broke, don't break it by trying to be the next best failure...&#34; Overall, Norton 360 is solid and would've gotten 5 stars if it didn't take intermittent dumps when interacting with Chrome.
72	-1	Overpriced.  I don't know why someone hasn't come out with a good office product for $29.  Their is a fortune to be made by someone.
73	-1	Horrible, caused my computer to crash after loading it.
74	-1	Have been a loyal customer for years. Was extremely disappointed to find that Intuit crippled the Deluxe version this year. It is totally worthless to even the modest investor. I gave it 2 stars because when I tried other software I was disappointed and came back and because they tried to correct the terribly misguided choice by offering Schedule C and D for free. THEN, when I tried to file, I was unable to because of a glitch with Form 2441. The help section promised an update to correct the known problem and has not happened by the date they promised. I am stuck in a frustrating circular pattern at the last step of filing. I cannot delete the form or enter information to make it happy....still waiting to file. If you can possibly use another program - do it.
75	1	I use MO at my job. I know I can export/import my work from my mac to display like my work like office but because I use MO at work I also wanted to learn more about how to use this software on my mac to make using it at work a little easier.  I do not like the format of MO software. It seems counter intuitive. I often find myself having to hunt for the right application in this software to get tasks done on the PC I use at work. It's like some knucklehead decided to hide some of the simplest tasks. The 4 star rating relates to the speed of the download and how well the Mac software works on my mac. The mac's quality makes this software palatable.
76	1	Maybe not as slick as the more expensive competition but it functioned just fine.
77	-1	Took over a month to have microsoft install it on my computer when it wouldnt work and they deleted it.  Microsoft had bad customer service and it took me 12 hours on the phone total to get the software installed.
78	-1	SO, i bought two cheap products and had no luck(couldn't even install it) so i installed this. Phh S***ty program! The video is extremely poor, has lines running threw it and it isnt my device, i can hook it to my television and its awesome. Run it threw this program and its CRAP, even worse the sound does not WORK! I contacted amazon and they would refund me on my cheap two (totaling $25) but the $40 product i have to eat. Im thinking i may be done with amazon im sick of being BURNED
79	-1	I BOUGHT THIS PROGRAM TO PLAY BLU RAY MOVIES ON MY COMPUTER. WILL NOT PLAY ANY MOVIES. SHOWS TITLE SCREEN AND THEN GOES BACK TO MENU SCREEN. WILL RECOGNIZE DISK, BUT WONT PLAY.
80	1	Time to get control - I hate doing the accounting stuff but QB 2011 is a BIG help.  Wish it was Mac native and you could attach receipt scans w/o a monthly fee but I'd like to win the lottery too!
81	0	What a pain to load and if you have other copies of 365 active it will create a conflict.
82	-1	There should be a zero star option for this. It's totally unnecessary for Macs.
83	1	the trial is great, I will buy when trial expires
84	1	Did the job very well. Saved a lot of money.
85	1	ive always liked the protection Norton offers and am very happy with the multiple ways I can design it to fit my needs.
86	1	Easy to use and works well.  The support people are good to work with.
87	1	I've been using Quicken for many yrs, and this new update insures that I will continue to do so. Love the app for my iPhone/iPad!  Love the way all my accts. sync up<br /><br />Great job!
88	1	ok
89	1	This program is well-made and probably quite effective.  The teacher is clear, the movements are challenging but do-able, and doing it will certainly get you in shape.  I wanted to clarify, though, that if you are looking for a &#34;peak fitness&#34; program, this is a different definition of the term.  It's not the 20-minute workout with 30-second blasts of cardio followed by lower intensity recovery periods outlined on sites like Mercola.com.  This is an hour-long aerobics program that builds in intensity over the course of the hour, with about six minutes of cool-down.  It's very well-designed, if you're up for this level of challenge.  This is what comes up first on Amazon when doing a &#34;peak fitness&#34; search, but it's not using the term &#34;interval training&#34; in the same sense.
90	0	The software seems fine so far. The promotion code Amazon gives you for $20 bucks off your next purchase doesn't work at all.
91	0	Works Ok
92	1	Love Norton and this product!
93	-1	My experience with this package is limited to having to use it as a customer's location. I am a principle at a computer recycling/repair center with over twenty years of experience on Mac & PC hardware and software, and have used almost every version of the major applications in MS Office.<br /><br />The 2013 Office is either a bad joke, or simply an effort to force buyers into cuddling up to Microsoft to get the package to work!<br /><br />The overwhelming majority of &#34;stuff&#34; in the package just gets in the way of useful work. It's like having to pull a tractor trailer behind your Civic when you want to run to the grocery store for a jug of milk! Four layers of menu pad options before you can do a simple task? This abomination requires it.<br /><br />There is absolutely no chance whatsoever we will buy this package for our use, or for resale to any customer. We don't want to become complicit in this [whateverthehellyouwanttocallit]
94	-1	Not a good program.  Not friendly, too many personal questions.
95	1	Easiest program in the world to use. Highly recommend!
96	1	I have used the two most well known names in consumer anti-virus protection.  In each, I have had virus issues more than once.  I have had no virus or other issues with Avast.
97	-1	I've been using Photoshop since version 6, way back when.  Adobe Photoshop has been the most reliable software I've ever used, up until the 'Creative Cloud' and their new iterative release cycle.  My experience with Photoshop CC has been poor, and this once vaunted name has been tainted with slow performance, random application crashes, and bugs.  Bugs everywhere.<br /><br />You have to contact Adobe's customer service to cancel an annual subscription, so the rep has a chance to talk you into more 'deals' and 'savings', all the while trying to sell you into staying with the product.  It's aggravating, to say the least, but on top of all of that, Adobe will charge you 50% of your remaining subscription for an early termination.  Their archaic methods makes me question the company as a whole, and I will reconsider any future products or services from Adobe.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find a copy of Photoshop CS6, where you won't have to pay a monthly fee for a buggy application.
98	0	The edit functions: cut, paste, copy,ctrl+n, ctrl+g, etc<br />These keyboard commands work when Quicken 2014 is opened and after a while stop working.<br />It seems that they quit after a simple search but not always.<br />I assumed the latest patch would fix this glitch.<br />It did not.<br /><br />I auto-enter transactions at least 90days out and need to return to the current date or zoom down to enter a new transaction and zoom back.<br />I often copy/paste cash & check transactions into appropriate deposit transactions and copy/paste info from my hotel reservation program.<br /><br />I find that my cash flow is best managed with this 90 day outlook entering expected revenue from each reservation as they are made with normal daily expenditures auto-entered. Beyond the 90 day auto-entry period, I enter overall anticipated revenue/expenditure estimates for each month.<br /><br />So, I must be able to use keyboard commands to jump to various dates, and cut/copy to enter nearly every transaction.<br /><br />After I am over such frustration, the rest of the 2014 upgrade maybe found to be very useful.
99	1	Doesn't quite have all that I expected or I need to use it more to find all it's potential.
100	1	The most important software in my life for the last 5 years, period.
101	0	I thought that this product was excellent for antivirus, but for the tune-up the amount of uses is limited and found that disappointing
102	1	Easy to download, easy to use, 5 free e-files.<br />would be nice to have a free state tax e-file code.
103	0	had to have it
104	0	I have downloaded a trial from the mfg. sight and it does not have anti spy like most other<br />antivirus products, for example AVG. It is not worth $39.00, but you can get it for less by<br />canceling the trial. and a new lower price offer will come up.
105	1	Never let it go!!
106	0	My software problem was the Amazon downloader. Had to uninstal and reload, thanks to Amazon tech. However, could not load my Turbo Tax PDF from 2013 because TaxAct site was down for maintenance?  So far able to start my return, waiting for more tax information.  This has to be better than Turbo Tax that snookered all their customers. I'll update later this month.  Next challenge may be brokerage account loading.
107	1	I like the feature of importing last year's information into this year's tax return, and the automatic carry forward calculation feature. For seasoned citizens, the automatic calculation of Social Security tax is a big plus.
108	-1	If I wanted to pay a lot of money to do my taxes, I'd hire a pro.  I've been a loyal Intuit, not just TurboTax, customer for over two decades and, despite nothing but a good experience with their products, it's clearly time to move on.
109	-1	This is the last year I will use turbotax.  At no time while completing my federal return did I ever check any boxes stating that I wanted audit defense.  Well, went I finally got to the very end before filing, it kept asking me for my personal information to complete the audit defense membership EVEN THOUGH I did not check any boxes asking for it.  I had to enter this information in order to go any further with my federal return. The next window, there was a question asking if I wanted to cancel my audit defense membership.  I clicked the box indicating my desire to cancel and the next window that popped up asked me if I was sure I wanted to cancel and I clicked yes.  Well guess what, I got charged for it anyway EVEN THOUGH I NEVER ASKED FOR IT!!! I was charged the $49.99 for the use of the software, then another $39.99 for something called turbo tax plus. Apparently, turbotax decided to bundle the efile fees with audit defense for California (AGAIN, I NEVER ASKED FOR AUDIT DEFENSE). I know the efile fees are not $39.99.  Basically, I was forced into this turbotax plus even though I never wanted it and now I have to fight with Intuit to get my money back.  By the way, I also attempted to do my California return as well.  Turbo tax wanted to charge me again for the use of the software and the turbotax plus again!.  I never filed my state return but if I had, the fees for both federal and state would have been over $120! UNACCEPTABLE!!! Apparently other users have had this similar incident happen to them as well. Of course, I'm getting the run around with Intuit and I have filed a complaint with the consumer affairs department. User beware.
110	0	Now that I have updated to Quicken 2015 the program will not recognize my vault password.  What the heck, I haven't changed it so why????  Not happy with this update
111	0	"OK so I should have taken warning from all the bad reviews about how hard it is to verify this product but in my arrogance I thought hey I'm a programmer, I work with computers everyday on my job. Wrong!  After I purchased the product I followed the instructions: I clicked on \\""continue to office.com\\"", then \\""get started\\"", then I signed on to my Microsoft account, then \\""get verified through my school\\"" and then I entered my school and then my school email address.  At this point I get the error, \\""Your email has already been used for verification.\\""  And that's it!  No further explanation on what to do next.  Now I have to waste time trying to figure all this out.  I'm sorry but you pay money for a product it should just work!  What a freaking pain in the...<br /><br />Update - I found the Microsoft help chat link.  It wasn't on the page that showed the error or at least I didn't see it there.  It would have been very helpful if it was.  Sorry I don't remember how I found it.  Anyway I chatted with Microsoft support and they took care of me quickly without any hassles.  I have a working product now.  I'm raising my rating from 1 to 3."
112	-1	WORST VERSION OF TURBOTAX EVER!!  Don't buy this.  I have used TurboTax for the last five years with fantastic results.  I don't know who had the terrible idea to release this version, but they should be fired.  This year, the software doesn't ask you questions to guide you through what you need to work on; instead it gives you a huge list where you can visit everything, or nothing within a specific topic area.  The problem is that I don't know a lot of the tax lingo, so I didn't know what areas I needed to work on.  I would select to visit all, but the explanations about the different areas was so limited that I had to research the internet to try to figure out what the sections were talking about.  There were a lot of errors this year.  I kept getting errors about my information not transferring to my state returns from the Federal Information Worksheet, even though I had completely and correctly filled out all my personal information.  I had to do a lot of research on the internet to try to figure out how to make the error go away.  Third, when it got down to the error check, I could run an error check and there would be no errors, then I could come back and run it again the next day and I would have two errors (and no, there was no software update).  My favorite of the software's inadequacies was when I tried to click on the link to give them a review of the software, and the link didn't work, so I'm stuck with posting it here.  Typically, I can finish my taxes in one weekend, this year it took me over a month because I spent ridiculous amounts of time researching how to navigate their software.  I spent over $250 between the software, filing fees, and additional states.  I'll be calling them tomorrow and pushing hard to get my money back.  I could have hired an accountant for not much more money, and significantly less hassle!!
113	0	It's great to be able to have the ability to have my company information on the cloud where I can access it from anywhere. However, the desktop version still has more features than the online version. The reports on the online version is still much less than the desktop version and I don't have a way to backup my data so I can go roll back to a specific date if I made a huge mistake on entering a transaction.
114	0	I found this software a little complicated for a beginner. It was recommended for the camera i bought for my business .
115	1	Avast lives up to its billing as being a all inclusive anti-virus software and protects me from harmful attacks against my computer.
116	0	"Amazon sells this the cheapest, I think.  So, if you are going to buy it, buy it here.  The download time was slight longer than suggested....try 7 hours as opposed to 2 hours or less as mentioned.  And, that 7 hours is only the download from Garmin to your computer.  It takes several more hours to finalize things and get it on your GPS.  So, make sure you have the time set aside.   By the way, I was using DSL high speed internet.    Also, when you are finished downloading and you click the \\""launch\\"" button.  Be patient.  If you are using VISTA it take about 30-45 minutes after you click the \\""launch\\"" button for anything to happen.  So, just be patient...watch the hour glass spin over and over, then following on screen instructions.  It's really simple, just long!    The product itself so far has shown very minimal changes in maps from what I can tell from 2009 to 2010.  But, hopefully it will be worth it in the long run."
117	0	Been using Quicken for many years and always had great luck.  The last number of years quicken attempts to keep you buying because they deactivate some functions after 3 years of use.  That doesn't seem to be right since you pay for them and should be able to use them until outside advancements change.  That's not the case with Quicken.  Bank downloads stop working after those 3 years for no other reason than they want you to upgrade.  Well, I play their game because overall the program does what I need it to do.<br /><br />I was concerned after reading other reviews that any new version has a bunch of bugs that seem to take time to work out with updates.  I have not had any of those problems.  My existing files download and import just fine.  I will buy again simply because I have to since I don't want to change the program I use entirely.  There doesn't seem to be an affordable alternative out there.
118	0	And M$ customer service is virtually non-existent.<br />I installed their S P 2 and it still doesn't save new files to my Mac Lion Macbook pro.<br /><br />*** update ***<br />I while back I renamed my root drive to /<br />I went back and renamed it back to root and now all is well.<br />M$ customer service still sucks~
119	0	FINALLY we got this working (after three calls to Quicken). Seems they rolled it out w/ bugs (and knew it). Now it works well.
120	1	Very pleased with this Norton Security virus protection. I was using the Norton 360 version and recently updated to this one. And, thanks for the great online price!
121	1	Have used it for years. Never disappointed!
122	0	Historically I have been a user of Turbo Tax.  After reading about all of the changes and price increase related to the 2014 Turbo Tax software, I decided to give the H&R Block software a try.  Well, I just finished doing one set of returns (I am the family tax preparer).  While the HRB version worked, it is very basic and to the point when taking you through the tax prep process.  I feel that the tip Turbo Tax gives you with just about every step of the way far exceeds the &#34;vanilla&#34; approach that HRB takes.  For the remainder of my work this tax season, I am going back to Turbo Tax.
123	-1	I still have not filed because my tax showing is much more than the difference from what I earned in 2012 & 2013.  I cannot get my question answered, and I cannot get find a number to call for help.  I feel completely helpless and must go elsewhere to have my tax bill figured and corrected.
124	1	I am just learning how to use the software but installtion was hard. had to use microsofts website to figure out how to make it work on my computer. im using a 2002 hp pavilon computer. with the standard memory and ram with windows xp service pack three. I know this computer is old but shouldn't have had that much troubles. other than that the program now runs fine and I am doing my school work successfully with it.
125	0	FYI, as a long time TurboTax customer, I just received this email from TurboTax today. Looks like they are trying to right their wrong. I am one that has been using Deluxe for years that had to upgrade to Premiere this year.  I will be requesting my $25!  I hope this helps some others that are in the same situation.<br /><br />&#34;We are giving $25 back if you purchased TurboTax Deluxe desktop software (CD or download) and filed your 2013 tax return and have to upgrade to TurboTax Premier or Home & Business to file your 2014 return. This will help you move to the right desktop product, while reducing the immediate and unexpected financial impact. After completing and filing your return this year, request your $25 here.<br /><br />I deeply regret the anger and distress we have caused those of you affected by this change. Our customers are the heartbeat of every TurboTax employee. Our hope is that we can regain your trust and demonstrate that our commitment to you has never been stronger.&#34;<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Sasan Goodarzi and the TurboTax Team<br />General Manager, Intuit TurboTax
126	1	Great product, user friendly, easy to navigate around program.  Love being able to customize reports to reflect the exact information that I need.
127	1	By having everything in one place that I can access everywhere makes my life alot easier. Using Essentials is great for small business and I would recommend it to any small business owner.
128	1	It's another edition of the most popular home accounting program. It has new features for use with Mobile Devices. I don't use mobile devices, so the new bells and whistles are lost.
129	1	Excellent software package
130	-1	i have used Quicken since 1992 and it has always helped keep my finances in order.  It is called Quicken and sure enough it has always provided quick and reliable data entry.  That is no longer the case - Quicken 2014 is UNBEARABLY slow.  It clocks and the screen flashes for up to 20 seconds just to record a simple log entry.  Everything you do takes at the very least 10 seconds - even just moving between data entry fields.  Changing accounts is even worse - at least one minute of clocking.  THIS IS UNBELIEVABLY PAINFUL!!  My equipment is not the issue - I'm running a one year old power gaming PC with 32 GB ram!  I am also running the latest version of Quicken and update at every opportunity in hopes something will improve - it actually got worse after the last update.<br /><br />I was using Quicken 2011 which performed just fine and then Intuit forced me to upgrade by turning off all online syncing to bank accounts for 2011 and prior versions.  Obsoleting a 3 year old product is bad enough but to push your customers onto a product with well known performance issues is simply unconscionable.  How they can treat customers like this and stay in business is anyone's guess.  They really do suck.
131	-1	If you have PE 12 Don't waste your money on PE 13. The only change from PE 12 is that they REMOVED the very useful ability to navigate in the timeline using the right and left movement of the Mouse Wheel. They still haven't fixed the copy and paste glitch in the New Project title line. I'm not even sure they looked at the program other than to change the name from 12 to 13 as there are no discernible differences in features operation or performance.<br /><br />If you can still find a copy of PE 12,  I would certainly do that instead of buying PE 13.
132	1	It was a great deal but still have a few issues w/computer that this should have fixed.
133	1	The program focuses on security not blowing its horn, Virus definitions are up to date and any intrusions are flagged and isolated quickly.  Life is a lot simpler with Avast!
134	0	Product is fine but my laptop is one of the fastest on the market and I have a large broadband pipe I am connected through... However the load from Amazon is taking about 1M for every 10 seconds = 6M / Minute....Shameful! 3G will take a while to get this downloaded...Maybe I should have gone direct to Microsoft?
135	0	This was not ready for prime time when released. I have used quicken sine 1998 and would have gone back to Quicken 13 if I could have. Eventually the issues went away. I will not update to Quicken 15 next year until it is out for at least 3-4months.
136	0	The Good<br />Easy Install<br />Good Interface<br />Numerous Options<br /><br />The Bad<br />Computer performance slows down...<br />Overpriced<br /><br />Unknown<br />Does it work???  Hope so...!
137	1	After years of paying an accounting firm $5,000 to do annual business and personal taxes on a small business, it took me finding a mistake to finally go to TurboTax. The additional benefit is the help menues so that you can learn what you are preparing and make tax plans for the following year
138	1	It gives me peace of mind having the Norton running on my computer keeping it safe of vireses and fixing the parts that need fixing..
139	-1	what a rotten experience this was. As usual for the past 10 years, I purchased A turbo tax Basic disk to do my taxes. My taxes have been essentially the same every year. I expected the same turboTax Basic this year. I got halfway through my taxes when I went to deal with the usual dividends and K-1 situations that I always have entered on TurboTax, when the sign popped up telling me I could go no further without buying turboTax premier for another $70.  Had I known this upfront I probably would have stupidly bought the premier in the first place. But I didn't. I have thrown the Basic turboTax in the trash. I have ordered another tax program from H and R Block. I'll let you know. PS I did read reviews of turboTax before I ordered it. I just didn't believe it. Fool me once...
140	1	"I have been using Quicken for over 10 years, so didn't anticipate any trouble with the installation.  However, when I did the \\""install\\"", the program didn't pick up any of my old data.  After several futile attempts to rectify the problem, I called your \\""help\\"" number, and got a gentleman whose accent was so thick, I couldn't understand him.<br /><br />I then called the folks at \\""iTOK\\"" who solved my problem.<br /><br />Two days later, I found I was unable to open the program at all.  Tried for two days, then some \\""gremlin\\"" interceded and the program can now be opened.  Hope I don't see a repeat.<br /><br />Bottom line: the install of Q-2014 was anything but smooth."
141	1	Works with my older Office files as I thought it would. It was easy to load and install. Painless process.
142	-1	My QB file is 75MB and 2015 is very slow even on an SSD drive.  I was running the same file on QB 2012 without any issue, but 2015 is just slow to load different features even once the file is open.  I wish I could go back to 2012 but I use payroll which requires a version that is greater than 2012, other then being slow, uglier and costing me several hundred bucks, I see zero difference in functionality.
143	1	Keeping everything at Fingers tips.<br />With running Two Companies That is important to me
144	1	Very Good. Thank
145	-1	this has destroyed 15 years of record keeping.
146	-1	Software was terrible to use . The fees and pricing have doubled I. The last few years. Some information doesn't transfer
147	-1	So I purchased turbotax again this year because it worked well last year. The big ticket for me was I knew i was getting a big refund and wanted to get in on the 10% amazon bonus. However, if you choose to get the 10% bonus, when you go to look at your tax documents that turbotax prepares for you, under &#34;Sunrise Banks N.A. Refund Processing Agreement&#34; paragraph 3, they charge you an additonal $19.99. Look closely, do it again without the amazon bonus and look at your documents, that fee is gone then. When I asked turbotax about it on their website no one responded. Very unhappy with this shaddy hidding of fees. H&R block next year or TaxACT for sure.
148	-1	Trying to do a 1041 return for a Trust return.  Got into an never ending error loop.  When you click on the link to correct the error, it comes back with two more new errors.  Customer support was of no help except to tell me there was an update scheduled for today and to tell me they are having problems with this form.<br /><br />Hope they get it fixed, otherwise this program is useless for a 1041 filing.
149	1	i have used the program for a couple months and it performs well. i have yet to run into software crashes or error messages.
150	-1	I can't review the actual product because I can't download the file I just paid $40.00 for.  The installer downloads, but won't open.  Amazon says the problem is with Intuit.  I don't think so.
151	-1	I have used Norton for nearly 20 years.  I was appalled that the device installation REQUIERED I use Google to install it!  One of the reasons I USE security is to protect me from mass marketing and miss-use of my data. NOT to require me to sign up for it!  The installation on my workstations works fine. I just upgraded to Fire Phone, so it is impossible to use Google install. A waste and a disappointment. I would have thought that Norton could support a download from their own website. What a shame for a once great company.
152	-1	Horrible, horrendous, awful... This pretty much sums it up. Since the update to this version (forced by Quicken, btw. that would kill my access to web connect if I kept using 2010 version past May 2015), I lost connection to Citibank and CapitalOne. I am not able to remove/add as it won't let me link to an existing account (nothing in the list) and instead insists on creating a brand new account. More? If I do update of all accounts, only some get updated, and others I have to go in manually and do one by one. More? There is more, but Im to pissed to list. I am writing to Amazon for a refund. This is outrageous! What a piece of sh**t software!!!
153	-1	I own 3 rentals and have used the Deluxe version for the past 5 years to enter the schedules for these rentals and didn't upgrade to the Premier version as all it offered was a Wizard to enter the data. This year they required me to purchase the Premier to even have manual access to the forms. Upselling me this for $30 is not a good practice. I'm looking into geting my money back after filing as they used to have a 100% satisfaction policy.
154	0	I renewed this and for some reason this new product isnt as user friendly as the older product.  It also has slowed down my laptop and sometimes I think it has messed it up on certain areas.  Wish I had not purchase this
155	0	CONVERSION FROM PREVIOUS EDITIONS DOES FUNNY THINGS TO DATA
156	1	Overall I was very satisfied with this product. Took less than 20 minutes to go from this page to up and running. I would recommend it to anyone needing office for their mac.
157	1	For years I was depended to my CPAs for my tax returns while some of my friends encourage me to consider TurboTax as an alternative. I was in doubt. However for past few years, I began to use both ways intermittently to assure my returns are accurate. This year, I had my own TurboTax before my CPA work to do my return for me again because I was concerned of my several sources of income and investment as well. They are exactly the same. I elected to submitted the return through my CPA office. I got my Federal and State refunds quickly.<br />I feel confident that I can independently to work with TurboTax alone for years to come. Thanks to TurboTax.
158	0	Been using since 2000.
159	-1	The reviews remind me of the year when TurboTax charged extra for doing more than one return. After a majority of one star reviews, Intuit punted and did an update that removed that limit and Amazon deleted all the reviews that complained about the surcharge, including one that asked whether Microsoft would start charging a dollar for every document created in Word. From the nervous-sounding replies from Intuit, I wonder if another punt is in the works. I hope this episode becomes the business school poster boy for throwing away a near monopoly on a product, even dumber than New Coke.    The year of the surcharge was the one year I used Taxcut, and I did not like it as much as TurboTax. From comments on this board, I guess it is time to give Taxcut another try.
160	0	Microsoft seems to be working toward the non use of computers.<br />This seems to be set up for smart phones and I-pads,  Too bad.<br />I will just stick with Publisher 2003 and 2010
161	1	Have used Tax Cut for years, very good product and easy to use, but beware if you buy this particular version which includes 1 state form during the use of the program there will be a popup advertising an upgrade to their Premium version for $15.00 that includes another State form.  This is false advertising as after I bought the upgrade, I needed another state form and tried to download and found out not possible. The support desk was completely unhelpful and actually acted like I was crazy for believing the advertisement that a State form would be included for $15.00.  I even sent a complaint in via their survey and did not even receive a reply.  The basic product is good but beware the bait and switch.
162	1	I bought Norton Antivirus because it has kept my main computer safe and clean from viruses. Since my family has been getting new laptops, this 3 User Version is a great investment. Getting a 1user Norton costs $20, making 3 individual packs $60, but with this pack, you save $30 and the steps are really simple. Don't get confused. You CAN use the antivirus for 3 PCs, not just one. I've had people stick their STD infected flash drives into my laptop and Norton detected and removed the viruses almost instantly.<br /><br />GET NORTON!<br /><br />-Brittany Sablan (The computer-tech daughter of Carmen Calvo :p )
163	-1	Well, after looking for explanations to the constant crashing of this software on Windows 7, I checked the Windows 7 Compatibility List and noticed that not a single product from this software company is compatible with Windows 7 so don't waste your money nor your time trying to use it on Windows 7, it won't work.<br />As an alternative, You can use WinWay Resume Deluxe version 12 or 14 which is compatible with Windows 7 although not listed in the Compatibility List.<br />Cheers,
164	-1	Caution. If you buy this version and have any stock transactions it will not allow you to e-file your returns. You will have to print and mail them. There is no caution that you must buy the Premier version which is only a few dollars more BUT if you buy it as an upgrade from within the Deluxe version its $30 more. TurboTax should be ashamed of their bait and switch marketing
165	-1	Every time I use an Intuit product on my Mac, I curse Intuit. Every time I have to launch my virtual machine so I can launch a much better Windows version of an Intuit product, I curse Intuit. After all these years, Intuit is still just throwing us bones. I have to use a patched 2007 version of Quicken just to have decent personal financial software on my Mac. Hello? Intuit? It's been 6 freakin' years!!! I've used the Mac version of Quickbooks, and compared to the Windows version, I might as well be using an Excel spreadsheet. The Windows version is that much better for ostensibly the same product.<br /><br />And now Willmaker for Windows, because the Mac version is online, is more money, and doesn't have all the forms the Windows version does.<br /><br />Intuit and Nolo, is it so much harder to work with Mac stuff? I work with it every day. And I can work on Windows too. At least I have a virtual machine running Windows 7, unlike most other Mac users. How about instead of throwing us bones, you actually pay attention to us? We're not going away. We have money to spend, too. We would just like it to be equal to the amount Windows users spend, and we want the SAME functionality.
166	-1	I would give this product a &#34;zero&#34; if possible. I have used TurboTax for at least for at least 20 years using the Deluxe version.  This year I am getting raped by the wonderful company Intuit, we I now need to purchase the Premier version to complete the schedule D form.  Well, this is the last year i will ever use this product because of this sleezy trick to gain revenue.  You were already more expensive than your competition, but I did like your interface a little better.  You have just lost another long term loyal customer.
167	0	I have used TurboTax in the past, which is why I tried it this year.  I had the information needed and input all; everything was as expected. But I was pretty appalled at the obvious DECEITFUL approach to  efiling the state tax; thereby increasing the cost of the Software by 50%!!!!  The tactic closely equalled that used by Columbia records years ago:  &#34;You can buy a fabulous _____(fill in) for only $15.00!!&#34;  and if you don't respond they send it AND Bill you anyway--because you did not tell them explicitly that you were NOT interested.<br />In Turbo Tax' strategy, you have everything you need to efile the Fed and state tax.  The Fed tax can be easily submitted....but wait, in order to efile the state tax, you have to pay them an additional $25.  AND your state tax is in efile format; AND you do NOT have the information as to how to send it via snail mail,  FOUL!
168	-1	Ever since I installed that, and it took two tries to do it. My computer has not been working right. I can get no support help and I finally had to revert to a system back up which removed it. I'm hoping after I get some tech help from a store here that I can put it back on. I do NOT like being forced to download software. I prefer a disk.<br /><br />B
169	-1	This download sucked, after downloading it told me it was a 30-day trial and then the product key wouldn't even work. Fortunately I was able to get a full refund even though it was a digital download. This was due to the circumstances of the download. Norton is nothing but bloatware anyways STEER CLEAR!!!
170	-1	When I updated my PC environment from Windows XP to Vista, MS Money was still working fine, by the time Windows 7 came out, MS Money was no longer was compatible (what a shame).  But over the time, to my disappointment, the different Banks slowly quit listing MS Money as a software download for statements, so I was forced to go to Quicken.  I found Quicken to have extremely too many bugs and was not compatible with numerous Financial Companies; in fact, many of the Financial Companies and/or Banks were not even listed in their statement downloads.  Now the newer versions slowly began to list all the Financial Companies, but when you download your statements, you have to go over each item thoroughly, especially to see if Quicken balances with the Banking Institutions; therefore, you have to carefully check all of the entries because Quicken has a tendency to duplicate previous downloaded entries.  The end result is, you not only have to do a lot of editing, but you have to also go back and forth with your different Financial Companies to see if there is an accurate balance.<br /><br />I became so frustrated with Quicken that I figured if I had to go through all the work of editing the downloads to make sure that all my banking and credit card companies were balanced, it would be worth my time to manually do the work in Excel.  My experience found Quicken to be one of the worse Money Management Software programs put on the market and is definitely not efficient and accurate.
171	-1	I have had Quicken since it first came out and have never had a problem.<br />With this release, Intuit has created a product full of bugs and it is impossible to contact support.<br />They really don't seem to care.<br />Apparently success has led to shortcuts and lack of Quality Control.<br />This version is a great example of garbage software.<br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
172	-1	THIS HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE.  I installed this program on Tuesday.  Caused my system to crash.  Restored.  Called Intuit yesterday, they allowed me to download from their website.  Downloaded.  System crashed.  Restored again last night.  Downloaded Quickbooks again.  System just crashed.  So tomorrow, I get to call them AGAIN.  Absolutely ridiculous.
173	-1	Intuit has a reputation for shipping sloppy, poorly-designed code, but they've outdone themselves with this product.  I have been trying to use this product for two months and I STILL can't even figure out how to print Invoices out (I have to use my ancient QuickBooks product), and how that I have customers entered, I still can't see my invoices (a customer lost his, and I can't print him a new one.<br /><br />I with some enterprising computer geek with a modicum of accounting experience could start over with a new product, and help out Intuit where they belong:  With Osborne, Palm, and Microsoft BoB:  A sad, distant memory.<br /><br />I hate this company's products with a passion, and I waste entirely too many hours running my small business just cleaning up after their crashes (I'm at Release 5), and trying to figure out how to do simple things.  Help, too, is pathetic.
174	1	A simple and easy to use program for limited needs for coordinated scheduling and calling.  Excellent product.
175	0	Largely straight forward product that makes completing my personal and small business taxes quite manageable. I like the electronic filing feature for federal and state. Disappointed that the program sometimes doesn't display calculations such as estimated tax amounts paid which caused me a penalty one year because it had entered it without displaying the amount in another part of a form and then I entered it again. After using the program for 15 years I find that it doesn't carry forward information on vehicular mileage which is important when disposing of a vehicle, creating a lot of work in finding previous years' info. Too bad current version can't open a previous year's return, even in just viewing mode.
176	1	Loving this program!  I downloaded the trial to check it out and the next day had a senior moment.  I was cleaning up my emails and accidentally deleted 6 months of important emails.  Yikes!  I started to panic and then remembered Rollback Rx.  15 minutes later I had all my emails back.  This probably sounds like one of those glorious false testimonials, but it's the real deal.  This program works as intended and works well.  I'm definitely buying it for all my pc's and I'll be getting their backup/cloning program as well.  I've already gotten my money's worth and haven't even bought it yet!
177	-1	This edition offers nothing of value over the '12 or '13 editions.  I only bought it because I had to when upgrading to new hardware.  It does not scale well for smaller screens and has limited font options.  It still has limited ability to handle complex investing transactions and does not know how to categorize some of the newer investment instruments.
178	-1	I use Quickbooks for my personal finances. Unfortunately, I haven't used this program since Feb-13 (its now May-13, and counting). The reason, I can't download my credit card transactions anymore from my citibank credit cards. No one at Intuit or Citibank can tell me why or when it will be fixed. It doesn't seem either company communicates with each other since Intuit tells me to call Citi (and visa versa)for the answer on this problem? It's been extremely frustrating not to mention a complete waste of my time and money.
179	1	Easy to use and accurate. It's like talking with a person.
180	0	I feel it wasn't as good as past years, more confusing than it should be, but still the best.
181	0	I had forgotten that Quicken does not create a budget, it reports what has been done, and the bank can do that, also. But being able to carry a recording device with you will help keep the budget under control
182	0	Intuit not only knows every details of my financial situation, my personal information, but also request payment (ransom) to keep them in their server!<br /><br />QuickBook takes some learning curve and thinking of double-entry method. But it is the standard accounting software everyone has to use.<br /><br />So take your time and learn so that to enjoy and forget about the forced upgrade every year or two to catch up with spoiled TurboTax ease of input.
183	-1	I am very disappointed in this product.  I couldn't get it to work on my computer.  I went to their FAQ and troubleshooting page, and discovered that you can only run this product with one monitor!  This didn't seem right at all so I wrote to their technical support via email and this was their reply:<br /><br />  Thank you for contacting Corel Customer Support.<br /><br />  Yes, You will need to use only one monitor, In order for WinDVD to play correctly, you need to use a single output, which we  recommend be your main desktop or laptop display, or change the way in which your display is connected.<br /><br />  Please do not hesitate to contact us with any further questions.<br /><br />  Regards,<br />  Inocencio<br />  Corel Customer Support Services<br /><br />Normally Amazon doesn't perform refunds on Direct Download software products like this, but when I shared them this email, they provided a refund.  Thank you Amazon.  Buyer Beware.
184	0	QB Pro can hold up to 300MB of data. If you compact your data, you lose a lot of detail, which is no good for our retail business because compacting customer transactions would erase details like warranties and serial numbers. If your business is successful, you can outgrow quickbooks quickly.<br /><br />Unfortunately for us, the next step up for more storage is the $1,000 plus Enterprise program. That is overkill for a single location company. It's like upgrading from a pickup truck to a tractor-trailer. QB should offer a practical solution in between Pro and Enterprise at a REASONBLE price.  Premier isn't the answer either. It is just pretty Pro.
185	-1	I purchased this software as an update.  I have been disappointed with it in every aspect.  The program DOES NOT FIT ON A COMPUTER SCREEN!  Are you serious? This program is a complete disaster.  Multiple windows pop up and you have to keep closing them if you can.  Never mind that you can't close windows because they don't fit on the screen!  The minimize and close buttons are off-screen! Really, you don't think this might not be inconvenient for a business owner?  I have used this program for almost 6 months and I would NEVER BUY ANOTHER QUICKBOOKS PROGRAM AGAIN.  It is difficult at best to navigate this mess of a program.<br />The help section is totally worthless  - you can read reviews of what others tried.  For the price of this software, they should have some basic answers for how to do simple tasks versus reading umpteen try-this-to-see-if-it-works approach.<br />I will no longer support QuickBooks and I will look for a different accounting program the next time I purchase one!
186	1	I used this for the first time when filing this years taxes and not only was it easy, I received a sizable return.  However, I experienced trouble once I reached the payment page.  The application kept asking me to pay a fee prior to filing.  I had to call Intuit to have the problem resolved.  So, Heads up if you purchase this application you may need to contact Intuit as well.  Hopefully, you find this review helpful.
187	1	Very good.  Easy to work through Fed & State taxes
188	-1	Prime Music does not work !!!
189	1	Excellent product. Has saved me many times.
190	0	Actually, I need a star halfway between &#34;I don't like it&#34; ans &#34;It's okay&#34;.  You can't transfer funds between accounts except by doing each as a separate entry.  Okay if you have no other choice and the price is right-- another fine example of you get what you pay for.
191	0	I do not normally bother writing reviews, but Avast just gave me a notification-popup to review their product, so....since they asked...    Like AVG before it, Avast started out as a wonderful piece of free software, but as time progressed, its focus has gradually shifted to becoming more and more commercial.  Nag screens to 'Upgrade' to the pay-version started appearing with greater frequency.  Notifications for updates to newer versions now border on bait&switch tactics, with a very prominent 'Upgrade' button which will make you pay, and smaller, less visible 'Update' button if you wish to continue with the free version.    Also, annoying notifications for additional products (ex: GrimeFighter), which require the pay version.  Notifications which can be turned off..... if you pay.
192	-1	Most of the features simply don't work.  Many of the reports and forcasts perform incorrect calculations.  I have limited success syncing online, as often Quicken gets errors trying to download transactions.  I have to track my investements in a spreadsheet, because the Quicket feature is a joke.  And the most painful part is just all the small bugs, like when buying a stock you have to enter the date and information before you can type in the new symbol, but when Quicket looks up the symbol it erases all the information you entered.<br /><br />If you want a basic checkbook with a calendar to track your bills, it is adequate.  But it's rediculous that they want $50 every year for an upgrade, and it doesn't include simple bug fixes.<br /><br />As a software engineer myself, I would be ashamed to work on this product.
193	0	"I upgraded from Quicken Premier 2011 to Quicken Home and Business 2014 (only because the quicken \\""forced obsolescence\\"" policy forced me to, or I would lose my online services).<br /><br />Upon opening Quicken 2014, I entered my data file password and received the message \\""The password you entered does not match the stored password\\"".  After restoring several backups and trying other fixes, I used online chat help and received the following solution, which worked successfully:  you must use the Quicken Password Removal Tool, which will upload your data file to quicken where the password will be removed, and then will download the file back to your computer.  As I said, this worked correctly, and I am now working with Q 2014.  It took me about 30 minutes to reach a chat representative, and 30 minutes for the Password Removal Tool to do its job.<br /><br />The password removal tool can be found here: [...]<br /><br />You will need to know the most recent balance (according to your quicken data file) of one of your accounts; the tool asks you for a balance to verify that you are the owner of the file.<br /><br />I'm pretty disappointed that I am FORCED to upgrade, and that this upgrade and bug wasted several hours of my day.  However, I've been using Quicken for many many years, and I believe that it's the best option out there."
194	1	This product seems to improve a little each year. The 1st year, there is a lot of information that you need to input. Each year thereafter, information is accumulated and this product fine tunes itself to your particular situation, based on past input.
195	1	Have been using avast for over 4 years now..... Im not just saying this but this is the best anti-virus i have used... It does it all... Keeps your data and info safe... I would recommend and have to friends and family....
196	-1	There was a glitch I guess because we had to pay an additional amount to electronically submit even though the software description said this feature was included in the purchase price.  We have used the H&R block software in the past without issue.
197	-1	I really need this tool to synch to a local folder.  I want to be able to just copy files in on a regular schedule... like I do with Microsoft One Drive and DropBox.
198	-1	If your state (mine is NY) taxes your mandatory retirement contributions, i.e. 414(h) your state income will exceed your federal income, and TurboTax will not allow you to efile. efile is now mandatory in NY so this mistake will cost me a $25 penalty. Thanks TurboTax, after 8 years of using your software you let me down. I guess I'll take my business and personal taxes elsewhere.
199	1	Price is right!
200	0	The biggest problem I have with this software is that it conflicts with the Mac's Time Machine program. This has gone on for years now and it's very annoying. The  tax program always asks if you want to check for updates (and there always are some) and that's where the problem is. The updater simply won't work correctly when Time Machine is running and will stay 'stuck' forever. I have to dismount my Time Machine drive in order to proceed with the program update. This has gone on for at least 3 years. I think it's time that H&R dealt with this! The other annoying thing this year was the program trying to sell me things. Other than these issues, I have no problem with the tax aspect of the software. I will be back next year, if only because I dislike Intuit so much.
201	1	I recommend Quickbooks Online to everyone.
202	1	Still the gold standard!
203	1	I've used Turbo Tax for several years now, and haven't been disappointed yet. Instructions are clear and easy to follow, changes you make adjust the forms dynamically so you can see the results. Can't complain...Turbo Tax has been great for my needs, and I'll continue to use it at tax time.
204	0	It's my own fault...I bought the TT Basic package at the store without really looking at the package back in December 2014 and it sat on the shelf. But, why should I...really? I've been using this same version since the late 90's...Also my fault, I also put off doing my taxes until the Sunday before April 15th and when I was finished entering all my data I am told by the software that to get all the money I deserve I would have to pony up anther $40 for the TT Deluxe version!<br /><br />Thanks to AMAZON and these very reviews, I found out that Intuit will give you a free upgrade...if you ask. I cannot remember exactly, but, if you go to their WEB Site and do a search on Turbo Tax Basic and then look for a button that says &#34;this does not answer my question&#34; (or something like that...sorry, I cannot remember WHAT I did because I tried looking all over the place). There will be a place for you ask for a CALL BACK and they will give you a reference number and ask for your phone number etc., then GIVE YOU a phone number for you to call. After calling that number, they will say they are busy and will call you back in turn (which they did!) Telling them my sad story, the very nice lady then gave me an upgrade confirmation number for free.<br /><br />I would have and should have given this a ONE star, but their customer support came through and the software then did what it was supposed to do.<br /><br />However, that said, I will look very closely at the software next year and if TT Basic does not do what I want, then I will look elsewhere, because the competition will import my Turbo Tax, previous year's TAX file as input.
205	1	I have all of my devices protected. Good value.
206	1	WORKS LIKE IT SHOIULD!!
207	1	I have used TurboTax for many years and love it.  By downloading instead of getting a CD I had it instantly.
208	1	This thing is great.  Why pay folks to prepare your return when this thing does it for you at a fraction of the cost.
209	1	2014 Taxes Underway... The challenge is always, when oh when will the updates be sufficient to submit the form.  Ok, I know you have to wait until at least 2/1/2015 or 2/15 (if you have 'foreign' income) But the one LARGE criticism is that you never know what is in the updates, and when it may be really safe to submit your returns...  That said, there is another issue with the charity portion of the schedule A. You can import from your previous year. You can import from itsDeductible, however, it doesn't match this years with last, ie putting in the values for the same previous year items.  it is a pain to try reconcile the deductions if the are the same or not the same...
210	-1	Do not buy this. It is a little difficult to use compared to Turbo tax and they don't give you all the refund you deserve. With this product I was only getting back $315. I knew that was too little since I am a student. I tried turbo tax instead and they managed to give me $1100. So if you want all your deductions get turbo tax.
211	1	I have used TurboTax for several years and have never had any issues with filing.  The interface is easy to use and the forms are complete.  My particular situation is not complicated, so I cannot speak to all the various options that are included.  I will continue using TurboTax.
212	1	Pretty much the same. It's a solid product, but I wish it didn't auto-fill the categories with the last entry.
213	0	It worked but I don't think quite as user friendly as the competition.  Then again maybe I have to spend more time learning how to maneuver through it.
214	1	It has saved my computer on numerous occasions from downloading Viruses, Ads, and other harmful programs.  It has been the greatest and didn't cost anything (Free version). Highly suggest people download this program. Used it for 8 years or more and never been let down. A must to have in order to protect your computer!
215	1	DOES WHAT INEED AND MORE  PRICE IS RIGHT WORKS VERY WELL I USE IT QUITE OFTEN  I JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO PUT THE ENVELOPES IN PROPERLY
216	-1	After loading the program says it is a 7 day trial. I checked a few MP4s out to see if it worked - OK until about 4 or 5 and then it wouldn't let you run any more than that.  Ripoff....Where does it say it's a 7 day trial?
217	1	Free Download, and worth every cent!
218	-1	Goodbye TurboTax. I have been using this product since way back when ChipSoft issued it. It was once an excellent product, with good value. Intuit has been steadily chipping away at it's value & utility - now they have stripped out capabilities for self-employed, rental income, investment income reporting & moved those to &#34;premium&#34; (priced) versions.<br />Sorry, despite your attempts at dressing this up in a positive PR spin, this is pretty obviously a simple price gouge. I am joining the many other formerly loyal customers who will no longer support Intuit.
219	0	Same review as the other office suite I bought to download....takes way to long to try and download it, almost a day and a half.  Way to long buy the cd ..what was I thinking?
220	-1	Program installed fine, very basic return but gives an error during the e file transmission. Chatted online with customer service to no avail. Turned off firewall, antivirus software, etc. Same error. Final comment from CS, I dont know what else to tell you. Thanks for nothing! Off to buy a product that works. My advice, do the same!
221	0	Had a lot of quirky problems since the program was installed. There are regular notices that it is working, but the question at this point is how?  May be too soon to draw conclusions between cause and effect.
222	-1	I not only don't like it, I paid for it hoping it would work, and so far I have not be able to get it working.  I've tried to contact Adobe and Amazon, and so far have had no response from either.  I won't buy another Adobe product again.  Sad thing is I am out $79.00.
223	0	Google maps is fantastic but sometimes I need this to route a complex trip better. S&T does the trick. For the download price this is good to have.
224	-1	Tons of bugs, doesn't even do basic displays on my 100% up to date Macbook Pro. Also, it doesn't support all the accounts that Mint does because apparently quicken charges the banks for support (what? really?!) So basically only 1/2 of my ~15 accounts are supported in Quicken, and they are almost all major banks (The Standard, etc...) All of them are supported in Mint, by the way.
225	1	Fairly simple process and am already familiar with MS Office. Met Expectations
226	0	It seems like a good virus protection. But there are so many settings, and I didn't unsterstand most of them.
227	0	Easy download, works well, my issues are with QB, what a racket.
228	1	Designs are good for what I paid for i. I was hoping for a few more ideas for logo designs but it's fine.
229	-1	I had a lot of issues with this software. It was the first time using it and I found it not to be very intuitive. It never made a copy of my returns even when I was prompted to do so (and did). I had to use my hard copy as a resource and actually had to go the the IRS sites to see the status of my refunds. I had an issue with my state return. It wasn't being excepted for some reason so I made an appointment with the nearest H&R Block office to see if they could figure it out. There software was VERY vague as to what the problem was. It had something to do with the disability tax for NYC. It states that what I selected was incorrect but according to the information from the software, I was supposed to select it. When I got there, they new what was wrong but wanted to charge me again to fix it. I walked out very unhappy. In the next 2 days it was finally excepted without me doing anything. I switched to this software because of what I was hearing from Turbo Tax upping their filing price and the user not knowing it till they were ready to file. I will either go back to TT next year or try something else. Defiantly not using H&R Block's software again.
230	1	Nice and easy process. Installation was fast and instructions were clear. I will definitely do it this way again next year.
231	-1	Freezes after ever 10 mins....  even with a new computer
232	0	"I bought this in a panic when moving to OS X Lion, as the older Quicken didn't work with the new OS.  I was concerned because of many negative reviews.  After using it a while, I've found that it is fine for everyday tasks such as managing your checkbook and credit card accounts.<br /><br />It's definitely not as powerful as the old Quicken for Mac, which is too bad.  Also I have yet to figure out how to set up a new installment account (i.e. a mortgage or car loan type.)  It imported my old installment accounts from the previous version just fine, but there is no longer a tool that helps you set one up, and I can't figure out how to do the automatic amortization that is needed for a mortgage.<br /><br />FInally, I have a beef with the way it reconciles imported transactions to your checking account.  In the old version, it would bring up a window that let you go transaction-by-transaction and verify each \\""match\\"".  Now, they all just appear in your account, already \\""matched\\"" (supposedly.)  The problem is when it doesn't match them correctly, it just puts them in as a new transaction.  The old software did the same thing, but because the entire import was shown in a separate window, it was easy to identify where the errors were.  Now I have to hunt through the entire check register for any transactions that should be cleared, but aren't, and then find where Quicken put the new one (often not with the same date due to the bank's \\""cleared\\"" date vs. the actual transaction date.)  This process is a real PITA if you go more than a few days without importing from the bank, so be warned.<br /><br />For these reasons I gave it three stars."
233	0	Norton is quality and i think does a great job of blocking damaging viruses. My frustration is when you go online, say to amazon and renew you still get the anoying, your virus protection will expire in X days. After researching and finally chating online, I went through a several step procedure and finally it went away.My other frustration is constantly having to log in the the Norton vault. The last thing is when Norton runs the updates, ocassionly it suggested you need additional help to correct  and of course for a fee they would happy to help. i personally don't like that approach.<br />'
234	0	"Now what?<br /><br />I was a Microsoft Accounting 2009 user. Still am, actually. I purchased QuickBooks 2010 when Microsoft threw me overboard. Not sure why they did - but that's another story ....<br /><br />I used QuickBooks 6.0 ages ago when my needs were simpler and life was easy. It worked for me. Then I started using Microsoft Accounting when they gave me a free copy early on. It is complicated but it was working well for me and is all tied into Business Contact Manager and lots of linked documents, appointments in Outlook, etc. But ... I had to move on.<br /><br />I ordered QB2010 from Amazon. QB touted it's conversion feature for Microsoft Accounting refuges!<br /><br />Oh, wait .... the conversion program does not run on Windows 7. I visited with my good friends in India for a while. They were very helpful and conciliatory but .... no go.  They suggested I back up the Microsoft product, reinstall on a Windows XP machine, restore, convert, back up again, and restore to QB 2010 on my Windows 7 computer. That process just never got to the top of my \\""to do\\"" list.<br /><br />I thought maybe if I upgraded to 2011 this feature would be worked out. Glad I read the reviews. There seems to be some fresh MBA's on the rampage at Intuit. Driving away very long term customers to make short term profits is tragically simple. It's just human nature for customers to stick with the devil they know. So ... shear those sheep, make some QuickBucks, and move on to a new corporate carcass!<br /><br />\\""Prudence, indeed, will dictate that software long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such software, and to provide new guards for their future security.\\"" *<br /><br />So ... I'm still using Microsoft Accounting 2009 which won't work with Microsoft Office 2010. That saved me some money right there. Still using Office 2007.<br /><br />I wonder if I can nurse Microsoft Accounting 2009 and Microsoft Office 2007 along until I retire?<br /><br />Small business accounting in a Windows environment ....<br /><br />Why is this such a struggle?????<br /><br />Oh well, Fleetwood Mac just popped up on Pandora and I'm at peace - for now.<br /><br />* with apologies to Thomas Jefferson"
235	-1	Not very user friendly.  You must start over each time you use it. Hire an accountant before using. They may fix this with upgrades, but doubt i would purchase again.
236	0	The latest update caused all my computers to run @ 100% CPU utilization and become unresponsive--had to system restore to get them functional. Until that point it had been excellent.
237	1	Once again I am very impressed with H&R Block Tax software! Easy to use very helpful when you need assistance. The easy way to do your own taxes with the backing of the BEST Tax company in the World if you need them to help you out!
238	0	The product was cheap but there weren't any state forms, I could have received the Deluxe edition on TurboTax's website with one state.  Also, after filing for two states and paying to have the refund submitted electronically, I spent over $160 on my taxes this year.  I could have gone to a brick and mortar competitor for less then I spent doing it myself.
239	0	After running my business and using Quickbooks, I expected more from Quicken for the personal money manager. It's probably better than most others that are out there, but I feel it could learn from the Quickbooks side of things and add more features.<br /><br />I'm going to continue using it and hoping for the best.
240	1	the software looks amazing ! and you cant get better than the price i paid for it !!! a great buy
241	1	Norton download is wonderful! So much cheaper than on Norton site.
242	1	I've been using Quickbooks for years. My business grew from small to medium/big in 16 years and still our strong allied.
243	0	very hard to use. I wish I had not bought it. You need a course in order to use this product
244	0	The product itself seems to work.  I cannot figure out how to use the add-on Grimefighter, though.  There does not seem to be any button or link to that that I can find.
245	0	I spent a week trying to download this, at first I thought it was Hughesnet, but I contacted Amazon and they told me there was a problem with Microsoft download, so I downloaded it again and it finally installed..YEAH!! I can't complain too much,it's there and that's what matters.
246	-1	Ridiculous that turbo tax is now trying to force people to pay more just to access the standard IRS forms.  I can understand that if people want extra guidance they should upgrade to premier versions where turbo tax can add value with more detailed instruction/explanation.  But turbo tax's tactic of denying me access to the basic forms unless I upgrade is unacceptable.  Last year I switched to TaxAct after entering all my tax info on both turbo tax and TaxAct and verifying that the end amount I owed came out the same for both products.  TaxAct's fee for me to file was very small, and I'll be going with TaxAct again this year.  Ah.... I'm free from Turbo Tax!
247	1	Download was a breeze.  Install was quick.  Drawing information from previous tax returns and the expected updating process all went smoothly  TurboTax is not simple to use; but its use does smoothe out and simplify the task..  Preparing income returns can be a complex and daunting task and TurboTax works for me.  Even with TurboTax, you cannot turn off your brain.  The preparer still has to bring together all the information and make sure that everything is correct, e.g. make sure that the appropriate boxes on the 1099's are checked such as Boxes A, B, C, D and ad infinitum. I like eFiling.
248	1	muy bueno
249	-1	Total disclosure - I only purchased this version because I received Intuit's notice saying that my 2012 version would no longer support WebConnect features that, obviously, I find essential! Otherwise the 2012 version more than met my needs and I do not see anything that is vastly improved in this version that would have led me to buy it otherwise. So....Intuit's strong arm tactics are the &#34;benefit&#34; that led me to buy this. Since i am writing this I may as well express my general disappointment and displeasure with Intuit. I have been using Quicken probably since the 1st or 2nd version. I have never had a major complaint with the product but Intuit seems to have become just another small company that was extremely customer-focused and friendly and is now simply looking for ways to milk its loyal customers of every dollar possible. The price of the product is not cheap - and once again thank god for Amazon's much more affordable digital download price. AND how about the price they charge for TurboTax!!??!! That product which Intuit gobbled up years ago, is outrageously expensive compared to other comparables. Why is is it $20-30 more than HR Block's tax software - which is just as good!?!?!? But, I digress. Quicken - it's a good product but I fail to see what significant advances Intuit is offering in its annual upgrades. I had the 3 year old product and so far aside from some cosmetic changes I fail to see anything that would have made me buy this version .... other than Intuit's overbearing notice that my old version was being mothballed by them.
250	0	Good capability---except the panorama app does not work.  Would rate higher if I could find a fix.
251	1	Everything Was Really Easy To Use, The Only Issue Was Some Files Couldn't Be Read.<br />Great Quality and I would Recommend this product.
252	0	In the past I have always used this software to do my taxes.  This year I decided to purchase it from Amazon and take advantage of the Bonus offer.  I Rec'd my refund over a month ago, placed two call's when the Amazon gift card via e-mail did not show up,  and I have yet to see my Amazon card.  Rec'd an e-mail telling me to look for my e-mail from Amazon in the next 24-48 hours - so they have the correct e-mail address and did not end up in my spam folder.
253	1	I have been using Block software for several years and it has never disappointed me. Each year it has new features and improvements which make a difficult task much easier and more accurate.
254	-1	It is in a loop where it says it cannot find my sound card.  As it says I have no sound card, it shuts down.  I have asked customer service twice by email how I can fix this error, and have--to date--no response.  I am very unhappy with this product.
255	-1	Upon downloading this product, I quickly realized that there was serious issues. The biggest of these is that, of the 7 banks that I have business with, no one supports the right file type. In order to get information into the system, I must create a 'Cash' account and download the outdated QIF file into it, then cut and paste transactions over. This is for all of my bank accounts! If I knew that the web-connect function would not be supported, I would have just build formulas into Excel. Why on earth would Intuit change file systems without ensuring a backwards compatibility? I also got ZERO help from their customer service.<br />Also, thank you Amazon for your equally amazing lack of support, since it was downloaded software, all they did was blow me off. Unless you know for a fact that all of your banks (checking, savings, mortgage, credit cards, loans, etc) use the right file, you are just buying a different version of Excel.
256	-1	Wasn't impressed
257	1	Simply the best free antivirus, maybe the best period!
258	0	not as easy as past updates to acquire and use previous data.  Why is Intuit stopping support of previous product after only 3 years?
259	-1	Let me give you a bit of history...<br /><br />I'm using an Asus touchscreen laptop that's relatively new.  Prior to owning this machine, I purchased Tune-Up 2012 and I liked it.  I felt like the software was a good value and improved performance.<br /><br />Earlier this year, I upgraded my operating system from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.  As soon as the upgrade was complete, I started receiving pop-up messages about the incompatibility with Tune-Up 2012 to Windows 8.1.  Surely, I thought, they'd provide an update so that Tune-Up 2012 would work properly with Windows 8.1.  But over time, I came to realize that they did not support their product properly, in my view.  Meanwhile, I had to contend with as many as, or more than, 100 incompatibility messages per day.  Sure, I could have have just uninstalled the software, but I actually liked it and after all, I did buy it and there was not a time limit on how long the license was supposed to last.<br /><br />I called AVG customer service and, after long hold times and very long delays in replying, I was essentially told to pound sand.<br /><br />So I &#34;gave in&#34; and decided to buy AVG PC TuneUp 2014 based on my previous favorable experience prior to the Windows 8.1 updates.  It looked and felt very similar, which was &#34;comforting&#34;.<br /><br />But it didn't work very well at all.<br /><br />This software is supposed to improve performance.  Instead it kills performance.  My laptop ran super hot with the fan running constantly.  Pages were much slower to load and I experienced a number of freezes that required a hard reboot.  It even killed my mouse's scroll capability and I had to do a restore (restored to the point just prior to installation of this thing) in order to regain my mouses full functionality.<br /><br />Then I uninstalled this software.  Guess what?  Everything ran much, much better once again.<br /><br />Oh, and it also has this quirk where it tells you to close the browser (Chrome, in my case), but it can't close and there's no hard close option.  Super annoying.<br /><br />So in short, I think that this software is terrible, I think AVG support (bunch of barely English-speakers from overseas, presumably) is horrible, and I also think it's horrible that they don't support legitimate prior purchases, forcing the customer to either deal with a defective product, or shell out more money for a new (and worse, imo) product.  Borderline disgusting.<br /><br />I think it's a lousy product that does exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do, made by a company that I am very unimpressed with.  1 star and a strong recommendation to avoid this software.but it can't close and there's no hard close option.

260	1	I've always trusted in the Norton brand of products to protect my computers. I'm in the technology field and I know there are a  lot of good products out there but for me, nothing beats the functionality, support and pricing for this product.
261	-1	Does not work on terminal server
262	-1	Downloaded, but does not function.<br /><br />DON'T BUY.<br /><br />Complete waste of time. Just by a good program on DVD and load it yourself.<br /><br />No service--Unresponsive.<br /><br />DO.  NOT.  BUY.
263	1	I have used TurboTax for over 10 years..great product, easy to use.
264	1	We have been using Avast Antivirus for several years and have always been satisfied with the service.  It has worked out well for us.
265	-1	I thought I bought the anti virus Fml.
266	1	Bought this mainly for Word. And I could not get the disk version as I own a macbook air. I was surprised how fast and easy it was to install. Great purchase
267	0	Don't like the extra steps needed to mark an entry as cleared.  Don't like that you can't choose to not include in totals for certain accounts.  You must completely set aside the account you don't want included in totals and then it's not included in any reports either.
268	0	ordered the wrong program, I have a Mac.
269	-1	We bought this because of the claim that it was the best program to learn a language, but it's very confusing and doesn't come with any kind of instructions besides a quick tutorial that is too basic.  The one on one with a coach is just the coach going over the same lesson that is on the program, and not interactive where you can ask your individual or direct questions that you have.  Plus the &#34;coach&#34; didn't speak english very well, so it's very frustrating communicating.  I would not recomment this program, especially for the price.
270	1	I will say right up front it costs extra for a state return and too much extra for direct deposit of your refund.<br /><br />However, for the majority of individual returns, this software is an excellent resource.  Not only does it anticipate most all of the scenarios of personal returns, but the help files cover other scenarios not covered by the software.  An example of this is how to handle a trust after the members have died.  I have used it for many years with solid success.
271	1	Can't live without it.
272	0	Need to reload it on new computer not able to do that  old computer, it lost.
273	1	We use to have Kaspersky as an Anti-Virus and we kept on getting Trojans that Kaspersky could stop.  The moment we down loaded Norton Anti-virus the Trojans went away and we have not had an issue since.  I had used Norton before at work a while back and I had forgotten how it it is.  Therefore, when our good friend who is a wizard with computers recommedned Norton I new we were making the right choice.  We will continue to use Norton from now on.
274	-1	They sent a trial version only and never sent the product key.  The phone call to get the key was a disaster,  I foolishly allowed remote access to their tech support in India and Avnish uploaded multiple issues to my laptop along with a scary hard sell for a $200 version.  I declined for an hour and kept asking for the product key.  Now instead of a faster running computer I have NO computer as it is at the repair shop.  Hopefully they can undo the intentional damage.  And by the way, I never did get the product key.  Worse than a rip off, it was malicious.
275	0	I needed to do a site plan for some modifications that I want to do to my property, and this looked like a good program. My primary complaint is that there are a million different versions of this software (some released under the &#34;Chief Architect&#34; name) and they all have conflicting sets of features. This one might do 99% of what you want, but leave you with one needed feature that isn't there.<br /><br />In my situation, I needed to create a single swing gate that was wider than 4ft, and the software automatically turns all gates into double gates if they're wider than 4ft. Other versions of the software have a checkbox for this. My version of the software doesn't have this checkbox, so apparently this seemingly very simple task cannot be done.<br /><br />The learning curve is a little steep, but there are some forums with very helpful people that can explain how to do things if you get stuck. The 3D modeling capability is nice to get a visual idea of what you've created, even if you want a 2D plan. It has fairly good libraries of items that can be added.
276	0	A bit complex and had multiple crashes
277	-1	Too complicated. I wasn't sure what I was doing or what CCleaner was supposed to be doing.
278	0	I had a very old version of 3D Home and Sierra (10+ yrs).  I thought the new 3D-Home rendition would better suit my advanced PC software, and so I bought it.  But to my surprise the options for things like windows and doors were very sparce --- Example: no double french doors, et al.  So although the package was easy to use and did meet my immediate needs, I would have preferred a MUCH LARGER selection of detailed furniture and building options to give me a better final product.  So ..............  Just OK for Me!
279	-1	I was FORCED to upgrade to continue electronic access to most of my accounts.  Some work, some do not work and Intuit/Quicken provides zero (or horrible) user support.  The next time I need to update/upgrade my basic accounting software, I'll look elsewhere.  If not stuck with this one for now, I'd return it and raise hell.  Sure, it still does the basics that Quicken is famous for, but the promised interfaces with banking institutions and others are clunky as best, all require some special arrangement and even then the results are not reliable.  For manual use and simple basics, perhaps OK; for the promised interactive features - Not Even Close.
280	-1	After years of providing Schedule D and able to import broker transactions and after I purchased the Deluxe version, I found out later that you have to upgrade it to the Premier version to get this functionality.  Poor communication to the loyal Turbotax customers.  H&R will allow to switch to their Deluxe version for free if you had bought Turbotax Deluxe.  The H&R Deluxe version now offers the same functionality regarding broker transactions like Turbotax Deluxe used to.
281	1	Easy to use, fast, recommend!
282	1	Great Open Office solution to Windows tools on a Mac.  I've used Apache for years and have never experienced a problem.
283	-1	After years on a PC and loving Outlook, I made the switch to Apple. I was warned ahead of time that Outlook might not work perfectly with Apple - so I tried the Apple Apps. They did not compare to my old PC Outlook, so I purchased Office for Mac.<br /><br />What a total disappointment. The Mac version is sad and pathetic compared to the PC version. First and foremost, YOU CAN'T SYNC AN IPHONE! I honestly could not believe this, so I spent days trying to find a work around. I subscribed to Onmicrosoft, didn't work. I bought a few 3rd party apps that claimed to work, they didn't. I tried everything -- there is no good option for syncing. Had I understood this, I would never have purchased the software.<br /><br />Also - I am not sure if this is Apple trying to ruin the Out experience -- but every time I start my computer and throughout the day, Outlook will throw out an error or ask for my password, even though I have entered it 10 times already.<br /><br />Hopefully Microsoft will be fix these issues in the next version, but I am afraid they have lost my business. I will be migrating back to the Apple apps and I feel like I just wasted money buying software I am not going to use. :(
284	1	I have used the product since 2006 and without exception each year has been done accurately and quickly. Quickly, however, doesn't mean fast and loose just that accuracy is never given the backseat to expediency. My only problem with the TurboTax software is the price. It's relatively expensive for software that can essentially be used only once for a certain year. Intuit attempts to downplay the complaints about the software's price by saying it's cheaper than using an accountant, however that's not a valid argument for defending its expensive price. TurboTax is software and its' price should be compared in value to other similar tax software not with a human accountant's fees. I have used Amazon since 2006 to purchase the TuboTax software as they seem to always have the lowest price plus Amazon allows you to purchase the TurboTax software and immediately download it to your computer. Buy it early in the year as Amazon, it appears to me, continuously keeps raising the price of TurboTax as it gets closer to April 15'th's tax day.
285	0	It was difficult to maneuver in. Pretty much you better hope you got it right during the interview or you would work your way through piles of screens to get to the one you needed to update. Plus if you put in Zeros on some screens it fails the post review test because you didn't put in a description of what you made zero money on. I mean really. It took me half an how to figure out what the problem was. At least it was cheaper than Turbo Tax, has auditing help, and you can own the software on your computer. I did Tax Slayer last year and they charge you to go out an look at the return you paid them for last year.
286	1	I have had avast for a couple of years since my mcafee expired; moreover I dont miss a thing.  Avast does a great job at protecting my computer with daily file updates, site & file warnings and frequent blocks.  I appreciate avast, thanks.
287	1	Way more software that I will ever understand, but powerful. Slowed down my computer significantly after install.  Encryption option may lead to NSA tracking of your data.
288	0	Finding the downloading link gave me a hard time.
289	-1	this program won't install on my computer<br />it says that I have some previous files but when I check in the control panel I don't see anything
290	0	Did what I wanted, allow editing Adobe .pdf file without paying Adobe's monthly editing fee.  My last .pdf file editing software is no longer being updated.<br /><br />However, came with many annoying extras that took time to delete and slowed my PC down after I decided I did not need them.  If I had done a &#34;custom install&#34;, may have been able to avoid them.
291	0	Wasn't that impressed with it.
292	-1	Not good! The program downloaded fine but then has caused continuous headaches. I have had to download at least a half0dozen times. Ughhh!! Not my cup-of-team.
293	-1	As a long time user that was forced to upgrade from 2011 I'm very disappointed in this product.  Right off the bat there are issues with some of the new features that don't work or corrupt data.  To compound the issue I can't find anyway to contact Intuit for support, no phone number, no chat, no email.  They hide behind community forums and leave you completely on your own to find a solution.  I'd give it one star but there are a few parts that seem to work as long as you don't step on a data corrupting landmine.  Thanks for forcing me to your new version.... I would've paid to stay on 2011
294	-1	Purchased this at a big box store because we have used it for as long as I can remember.  My husband opened it and then realized that some of the scheduled were missing and then read the reviews.  I am going<br /><br />The same thing happened a few years ago with Quicken. I had used Quicken for about 25 years (started when I was 13 on a DOS machine) and was irritated when they forced me to upgrade to continue using download features. I came to amazon and saw the reviews so I started looking for something else.  I found YNAB and switched to it and couldn't be happier.  It is a far superior budgeting tool.
295	-1	I just upgraded from Quicken 2011 to Quicken 2014, only because Intuit will no longer support investing data downloads for Q2011. I found that the budgeting module, which was clear and very usable in Q2011 and before, was changed in 2012. The new module is almost unusable: it is confusing, non-intuitive, and extremely difficult to use. It also appears that my previous data was not completely transferred from the previous version. Intuit on-line user comments are uniformly negative. If budgeting is the main reason for your purchase of this product you will be very disappointed.
296	1	Repeat customer of TurboTax.
297	1	Easy to use.
298	0	good condition
299	0	did not use,internet connection too slow
300	1	Cleaned up my computer fast and made it run a lot better then before with some of the other antiviruses
301	-1	QBKS 2015 is a resource hog.  Be sure and check minimum hardware requirements before making a decision.  2015 also appears to be unstable, at least the Premier Accountant and Premier Small Business editions.  I have had more program freezes in the last two weeks than I have had with QuickBooks 2010. 2013 and 2014 over the past several years combined. Maybe the new HP desktop from best buy that my client just purchased isn't up to the task.  I would use my laptop which has an Intel i7 5h gen and 8GB Ram but connecting wirelessly is excruciatingly slow.  Funny, I had no problems with same client with QBKS 2014.
302	1	Good interface, solid results. I have used some of the competitors and found this to be the easiest to use.
303	1	Switching to QuickBooks was one of the best decision I could have made. QB allows me to create estimates quickly and easily. Converting to invoices and linking my bank to QB was a snap. Using the integrated payment options gives my customers easy options and helps my closing ratio! QB makes be look as big as my corporate owned competitors, but with flexibility and nimbleness that gives me a leg up!
304	-1	I've used TurboTax since 1994.  This year they've clearly demonstrated their elitest attitude and how they really feel about their suckers, er customers.  I only do a couple stock trades a year and for that I'm forced to buy the Premier version ?!?!?  I decided to go with the  [[ASIN:B00PJPI6G6 Deluxe package from H&R Block]] and it truly is Deluxe.  All the federal forms, 5 fed efiles (lets you prepare unlimited returns for family and friends), and state return on CD all for $25.  It imported last year's TurboTax file quickly and accurately and worked great.  I'm switched for life.
305	-1	I, like other reviewers, have been using TT since approximately 1997.  However, due to their price increase in order to gain prior years Deluxe version software features, I'm switching over to a different product.  It is outrageous that they think it is ok to charge $119 (business version) for software that a usual household needs if you can go to a local tax accountant and have the return done for under $175. TT shame on you.
306	0	Ok software, a little bloaty and really became useless the whole time I was also using my PC for bitcoin mining.
307	-1	I'm not going to go into a long drawn out spiel.  Basically after the update, all the work I had done for the last 6 months was wiped out.  Even my back up would no longer work, and all other spreadsheet programs I tried say the files are corrupted and won't open.  You get what you pay for and I learned my lesson as I start over from basically scratch.  Never again.  I can't recommend this product in any way, shape or form.
308	1	Did what it always does for me. Made it quick and easy to file my taxes. As long as you have all your info to plug in when needed it's easy.<br />I got my Fed back in 7 days and State back in 11 days. What more can you ask for?
309	0	Overall a very good product with one noticeable glitch.  Transaction renaming rules stopped working during upgrade from R2 to R3.  Would have been nice to incorporate reminders into the mobile app.
310	0	Waaay more complicated than I thought, but it's good for those who can grasp it.
311	0	Works great for the Federal. But I had to mail my state return
312	0	Good programs but tries to cater to too many user levels at the same time (beginners, intermediates and advanced.)
313	1	Absolutely no issues with installation and it's not taxing on my system.  I am safe and happy, and the price was right!
314	-1	Just purchased Quicken 2013 after reading Kathyrn's reply that most problems were fixed with the mobile app.  When I looked at my accounts on my ipad not one account had a correct balance.  I'm on version R8 which most replies say fixes the problems but at this point I restored my accounts back to where they were before I updated to 2013.  Now it is taking forever for my cloud data to erase. Very disappointed.  I've used quicken for years but without a reliable mobile app, it's time to find something else.  How do I get a refund?
315	-1	when I first got this program it worked great. NOW after several updates it slows down my machine. Makes the CPU spike at 100% while scanning. AND to top it off it gives false positives on java program such as minecraft launchers. AVOID this product. It's not worth it, not even free.
316	1	Love this product. Been using it for years. Makes things very very easy. It seems to get better every year
317	-1	Since I've purchased it I couldn't access the suite twice now, wasting a lot of my time trying to get tech support to fix it.
318	1	WordPerfect is, well, PERFECT.  Love the new version.  Been using WordPerfect since 1987.  It's everything a word processor should be and more.  Thanks, Corel Corp.
319	0	I only bought this because my Quicken 2010 was turning off the ability to download transactions.  I'm kinda sick of Intuit doing it.  It works just like previous versions.  Sure there are some new things, but I don't really care.  The version I bought in 2000 does the same as this version now... enough for me.
320	1	great, thanks
321	1	Very good.
322	0	I really like the midi feature, the feedback mechanism is important, it has some weird fingering recommendations, I would use in conjunction with another book<br /><br />I hate the accompaniment, the demo songs play with full instrumentation, I want just the piano, a miss.
323	0	Very nice for the young but for older children I can see them becoming board in a short time as it is rather slow going.
324	1	I haven't been able to afford the last few &#34;episodes&#34; of Photoshop, so have struggled along with Photoshop 7. I finally upgraded through the subscription process to the Adobe Creative Cloud Photograph program and am glad I did. The download is seamless on my Windows 7 machine. I am now in the midst of the learning curve between my years-old 7 and this great new package of products. I only use this for photography, and this will not be a detailed review of the programs' many subsections. I only wish to say that, as opposed to the reviews I have read on Amazon, I have had great success with both its installation and use. Lightroom (after first getting my permission) grabbed all the digital images from my PC and arranged them easily. Since I shoot many frames per second, I have hordes of images and LR is one of the best in helping you decide what stays and what goes. I will admit that I downloaded these programs directly from Adobe rather than through Amazon, though I am an Amazon Primie. It just seemed to make sense to go to the source.<br /><br />If you are cautious, you can do a 30 day free download or cancel your subscription after 30 days with no further obligation. I think once you have these pinned, though, you will begin to see what a great photographer's help they are and how the new features enhance your images even further. Highly recommended!
325	-1	doesn't install at all tried downloading it around 14 times nothing worked not even restarting it no help at all either
326	1	Downloading the Turbo Tax is quick and easy.  No need to wait for delivery to take place.  My preferred method of choice.
327	0	The product appears to work OK, but, what I don't like are the pop-ups about Nuance on various web sites.  When will these people figure out that this stuff is more irritating than helpful.
328	-1	I would ask for my money back if I thought it would help. I would load Norton from the website.  It would work fine for a day or so. Then it gives the error messages and won' work. I go to Norton site and try their Eraser and Uninstaller and go through the entire process again...ditto. I tryed to download from a Norton site...same results. I took off all other software with firewalls such as Malwarebytes...same results. I finally said the heck with it and downloaded a free virus software.
329	-1	This review applies only to the business part of this product. I did not use the individual component.<br /><br />I installed the software on a 32-bit system with no problems. According to other reviewers, installation can be a problem on 64-bit systems.<br /><br />A lot of people seemed to have display issues, but the graphics worked just fine on my machine. I found the interface to be cumbersome, though.<br /><br />PDF generation was problematic. Numerous pages of the return were incomprehensible. What good is the software if it can't produce a paper return and can't file electronically?<br /><br />Software and form updates were easy, but the program is slow.<br /><br />Overall, I found the program frustrating to use. I gave up on it and did the returns by hand. A lot of the steps in the interview involve filling out a form by yourself, anyway.
330	1	I have been using a few popular video processing programs for my video editing tasks. The Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus comes with many similar essential functions and features for general video editing. It also comes with some nice special editing features not commonly found on other software.<br /><br />The user interface is laid out in three tabs : Organize, Edit, and Author.<br /><br />The Organize tab has a collection of all the photo / audio / video media, projects, imports, and effects. The program also automatically searches for the user folders the first time we launch the program. This might not be something everyone prefers as it could load the menu with hundreds of existing videos. However, we could customize this &#34;watchfolders&#34; in the setup menu to include / exclude the folders based on our own preferences.<br /><br />The Edit tab allows us to perform all the editing , transitions, and effects for our video projects. It allows upto 24 audio/video tracks which can be used as overlays. It also comes with th... Read more
331	-1	I could not file my return until March 20 due to a H&R Block software bug. H&R Block did not issue the bug fix until then. Since I ordered the software through Amazon, I have to write in to H&R Block to get a refund for the software, and that will take 4-6 weeks. This is after spending many hours on the phone with H&R Block product support for them to tell me to wait until March 20 for the bug fix. I will never work with H&R Block again.
332	-1	I can not download this product and have it work. I don't know if i'd have the same problem if I spent more and bought it from Intuit.
333	1	I LOVE IT
334	0	I thought it might save me time by entering transactions via phone. I tried once. It didn't work. Haven't tried again.<br />Won't print address on selected envelopes.<br />Other functions seem to work well, for me
335	1	Great product.
336	1	We've used it for years.  Couldn't ask for more.  Daily updates, frequent virus blocks on our computers, and totally without cost!
337	0	Not great, not terrible. It's a free AV, so it lives up to those expectations: offering minimal protection while bombarding you with &#34;bait&#34; to upgrade
338	1	Been using 360 for a number of years.  Stills puzzles me why I can always find it substantially cheaper on Amazon that by renewing directly with Norton.  Seems to me Norton would do well to offer more competitive renewal prices.  Have been quite satsified with Norton 360 over the years.
339	0	Handy program, with a few goofy implementations and the worst tech support in the solar system.<br /><br />I was about to write a review trashing this software for not allowing you to move a clip out of a bin. I'd dropped a clip into the wrong bin by accident and was trying to get it back out. Undo did nothing but undo Subclip tags. I couldn't cut it. Couldn't copy it, couldn't drag it back to the up folder button. I ended up going to Adobe tech support. There the friendly  support rep told me that the ONLY WAY to move a clip OUT OF A BIN was to DELETE IT, reimport and RETAG ALL OF YOUR SUBCLIPS. Insane, I know. How does a program made specifically for organizing a mess of footage not have a way to drag a clip out of a bin?<br /><br />But that's not true. Of course, simply going to the list view instead of the icon view lets you drag clips wherever you want them- a fact I stumbled across accidentally. It's still dumb that you can't just drag, or cut, or paste in icon view, but whatever. You can do it and, contrary to my thoughts when the tech support rep told me I couldn't move clips out of a bin without redoing everything, it isn't complete garbage. Adobe Tech support, however... Well, let's just say I'm starting to suspect their KB articles are written on dirty diapers and molding napkins. Don't lose that community forum password....
340	1	no problems. e-filed federal. refund in 9 days
341	0	ok product
342	-1	I think I was able to use it at first but suddenly I was required to give a product key which I do not have- this is ridiculous!
343	-1	Came with ware, by that I mean it came with this weird uninstaller sub for the normal windows uninstaller, not sure if this is considered bloatware, adware or something else.But it uses disk space, something my laptop doesn't have much of.
344	0	The latest version is better than the last.<br />Flags next to accounts appear when no activity has occurred<br />My Money market account does not accurately the balance.
345	1	This one works best for my needs and taste.
346	-1	very complex, not designed to create frame by frame animation, switch layer tool is broken, not even the book written by chad could help, the frame limit is 3000 frames, so you can only create 2 minutes of animation. its a rip off, do not waste your money with this product.
347	1	This product was easy to use and has given me peace of mind.  Thanks, Amazon for the ease of ordering and receiving this product.
348	-1	Save your money. Aiseesoft products are as crappy as it gets. Do not waste your money! Amazon should not even sell their products. Aiseesoft is not a good product at all.
349	-1	The mistake I made was relying on my 20 years of using Turbo Tax as being a reasonably priced tax program.  I now notice that they do mention that the programs have changed, indeed they have.  This is my last year of using TurboTax, appears that other services are more reasonable in price and services.
350	-1	R2 not ready for use. Fixes posted by Quicken do not resolve problem. Recommend waiting until reviews indicate fixes are working... Well it's been 7 days now and still no response from Quicken support. Uninstalled 2014, reinstalled 2013 and recovered data...
351	1	The software is remarkable!  I have enjoyed Paintshop for years so I knew it would be good but this is remarkable. It has new features that make photo editing even easier than before.  Also the Reallusion makeover software that came with it is remarkable as well. I would recommend Paintshop Pro X6 Ultimate to everyone.
352	1	Would never do my taxes without TT.  And even though they might have some glitches year after year... they are head and shoulders above the rest.  I also love Amazon's Software Download feature.  Not only can you download a copy, burn it to disk and start using it right away.  But if your disk is damaged you can go back to the download site and see all the products you have downloaded over the years AND re-download them if you wish.  Great setup.
353	1	only one I use
354	0	Apparently TurboTax for Mac users has many issues this year, my first year using my new Mac.  To begin with, I had to re-enter all of my info from last year and personal info that should have been stored with my account.  This is my 8th year using this product and first time having issues.  I was told I did not purchase the product last year that saves your info, you would have had to upgrade last year.  Then, went I went to file, I got error messages telling me to to print and file by snail mail.  This went on for two hours, with me trying all different things to fix it and working with others on forums (still getting emails from forum people having same problem) and waiting on hold on TurboTax Customer Service.  Finally, not sure what happened after I turned my system off and walked away for the third time in frustration, it just worked.  My refund came quickly after that.
355	0	Beware, the new Office 365 is linked to a SINGLE Microsoft account.  So, even though the license may allow usage on multiple devices, they ALL must be logged in with the SAME MS account.  This is a VERY different model than previous versions of office, so buyer beware!
356	-1	Undupe 1.2 is no doubt the worst duplicate finder I have ever used.<br />It is very slow.<br />Not at all user friendly.<br />Bad investment. I am sorry I paid $11.00 for it. A waste of money in my opinion.<br />There are no returns or refunds!
357	-1	I bought the product hoping to create a simple budget. Instead, all it allows me to do is to work off of my current expenses per my bank account. Could someone just tell me how, using Quicken Deluxe, I can create a budget from scratch--one that doesn't depend or utilize my expenses for the last few weeks or months? I just want something that allows me to create a straightforward budget. It's probably simple but I haven't been able to figure out how to get there.
358	0	I had 2010 and was really hoping that this version would connect to the banks faster & better than the old version. Although it certainly has more bells & whistles than the previous versions; at downloading it is not improved.
359	1	This was an easy install and easy to use. The 2006 kept loosing the file. I am very satisfied. I will be using future Quicken
360	1	This software has worked very well for me, and I highly recommend it.  I appreciate Avast for offering it.  Thanks.
361	-1	I have used Quicken for 20 years...back when it was brand new.  I upgrade every three years to continue to be able to download transactions. IT used to be such a great program and ran flawlessly.  But I just upgraded from 2012 Premier to 2014 Premier.  I don't care about new graphics or colors, but the fact that it hangs at every opportunity, or does not advance to the next area by hitting the enter key(i have it set to do so) all of the time, makes it the most unreliable version I have ever had.  Intuit wants us to buy a new version every year.....I understand that.  But add whatever little gadget you want, but do not take away functionality.  I have upgraded to version 6 it says, but it still runs terribly compared to 2012.  I do not understand this at all. If there were other good finance programs out there I would switch, but why do they screw up the smooth running stuff just to get us to buy a new version????
362	1	Haven't heard anything from the IRS yet, so it seems to have done the job
363	1	Works great have it on pc and laptops and have less problems then with other companys
364	1	It's a good program. I've had it before, so  I'm familiar with it and I've always been impressed with how well it helps you to improve your typing skills.
365	-1	Downloaded the software from WinZip official site. This was a huge mistake. The software comes with malware and adware. My internet security software was able to block the &#34;adware&#34; that came with the program, but did not block the &#34;Vosteran&#34; malware that came with it. Vosteran changed my browser setting. Wasted my time just trying to get rid of it.
366	1	As a experience PC tech I can honestly say this was the product I always needed.  The time to re-install windows and all the applications that the client needed was the time consuming task I dread.  To simply restore the PC to a previous state is perfect.  This product is great.  The concept it represents should be built into the design of the OS of Windows.  Whether the future Windows 8 or 10 will have this feature I don't know yet.  I can only hope so.
367	0	i was able to use product. however it did do what it promised. again i do not appresiate having to type more words based on your requirements.
368	0	This is the digital download from the Amazon download site, I understand the same problems would have occurred even if I had loaded TurboTax from a CD.There are 2 glitches this year that I found out about after spending close to 4 hours on the phone, 3 separate days. According to the supervisor I spoke with both problems are due to extensive software rewrites and policy changes.<br />  First, when you go to file your state return the program program wants to know if you want to use part of the Federal refund to pay for the state e-file, even though a free state e-file is included.  To correct this you have to contact TurboTax to get  an &#34;unlock&#34; code.<br />  Second is a lack of information in the refund bonus eligibility rules.  The eligibility requirements for the TurboTax desktop version does not list a minimum Federal refund for the bonus offer, only that you:  bought the software from Amazon or TurboTax, e-file your return, use direct deposit into one account, have a US address, are over 18 years old, and purchase the e-card in multiples of $100.  Another requirement that came up was a $160 &#34;holding fee&#34; for the online version of TurboTax.  It took me 3 days - 12 hours of conversation with 8 different customer support representatives to find out that the requirements had been changed to make both versions the same.  To be eligible for the Refund 10% bonus offer your Federal  refund must be at least $260 ( the $160 &#34;holding fee&#34; + a $100 multiple).
369	1	As a former Microsoft Money user, I was nervous to switch programs (Microsoft Money is no longer supported).  I have thus far been impressed with Quicken.  It is an easy to use, intuitive program.  I have not yet delved into some of reports available.  I do really like how seamlessly it connects to your bank account and balances your ledger in real time.
370	-1	It would NOT download properly at all.I left 3-5 messages with NO replies.It did let me use for 7 days trials.I admit Iam not a pro,but following step by step instructions.Getting simple Blemish/line remover looked like lip-stick was used to cover a blemish(zit)on my face.PTL,for Amazon called on day 1 they helped with refund.
371	0	It does not do a good job at stopping viruses in downloads, and although it states everything is good, if you run a boot scan you may find up to ten or more items that are infected.  I suppose you get what you pay for, and it is free.
372	-1	Not very satisfied with Turbo Tax it has cost me about $4000 total the last 2 years. Would not recommend it until they can get their software glitches in order.
373	0	It is OK. I cant seem to get help in making the text larger. The text is too small and I have to try very hard to read the columns
374	-1	Once you get a hang of the software it's pretty cool to design a building, but I can't create a basic driveway with the essentials edition? Weak.
375	0	I've been using Quicken for many years to track spending, bank accounts, etc. I think it does the job quite well.     I'm only upgrading because they are forcing us 2007 users to upgrade or lose the ability to download bank transactions.     From what I have seen so far they are just changing the screens to be changing them. No real function upgrades that I ever use.     I had zero problems downloading the sw and upgrading. I did do a full backup just in case but it took care of everything quite nicely.
376	1	Used it for many years
377	0	It did basically what I wanted but find it a little unclear in what it can do and not do.
378	-1	I did download this thinking that there would be some lessons available for my 5th grader.  When you download it all of the lessons you have to pay for.  I called for assistance with the product only to find all the mailboxes are full.  I plan on reporting to the BBB
379	0	Have had no problems working with the software, up until the point where I wanted to complete a Part-Year Delaware Resident return.  This is apparently impossible with this software, but you have no way of knowing this until you get to the screen to download the Delaware State package.  At least it says something at that point before you are charged for the state download.
380	0	Worked fine - but I think it's very expensive as an annual expenditure, plus the additional costs your get charged for filing and bank transfers.
381	0	I bought the ONLINE version of this program.  You can use it anywhere you have internet access.  There's nothing to install.  Mine is a lifetime deluxe version for up to 3 children.  It was a special offer through Plum District.<br /><br />I am a computer instructor and my child is heading into first grade.  She says she doesn't like to read.  This disappoints me.  I LOVE reading and I think she'll feel differently as it starts to come more easily to her.  I got this in the hopes it would add to her enjoyment and increase her success.  I've only played with it for 10 minutes but my thoughts are that Reader Rabbit is more fun and less $.  The only difference is those programs are installed and not something for anywhere/anytime online.<br /><br />They have a free trail so I'd say to use that and try it first.
382	0	Was able to import all my banking information from Quicken 2011 with no issues; however, this version is very buggy.
383	1	Have used the product and like it.  performs well and is easy to use and protects your system as well as expensive programs
384	-1	No it did not work on my computer and that was just a loss to me.  I also tried another download one didn't as well.  I will be leary of doing that again for sure.
385	1	I have tried several internet security programs. Norton seems to provide more information of how it is protecting my data. It is easy to install and renew. It has protected me well.
386	1	A computer geek buddy got me hooked on Avast years ago and it's all I've used since.  never had any malware or viruses.<br />Can't recommend it enough.
387	0	Cons:<br />Does NOT transfer information from previous Quicken installs. If you like starting over from scratch, buy this product. Otherwise, you'll have to buy one of the premium versions.<br />Does NOT convey in an obvious way that it will not transfer other quicken installs.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Makes getting information from banking institutions online quick and painless<br />Easy organize and view transaction history<br />Easy setup and monitoring of budgets<br />Great for simple household bank logging
388	1	awesome and free!!
389	1	Hello, I want to thank you most sincerely for the AMAZING, WONDERFUL recovery software which I purchased today. I thought I had lost all the 700+ photos which I took on a trip last month but by using this software I have recovered them. However, I will know in the future NOT to use a FAST SPEED card on my point and shoot camera - there is insufficient information to tell ordinary camera users that this can cause problems for them. Thank you once again
390	0	I prefer the PS Elements 7 over this version. Sometimes newer isn't better!
391	-1	They charge, more give less. This software operates on Mac OS X 10.8x (Mountain Lion) and lower. Wake up Intuit, it's 2015 the current Mac OS is 10.10.5  so your latest version is useless to me and any other Mac user who chooses not to live in your dismal little world.
392	-1	If I could give zero stars, I would.  This program is simply horrible.  Not user-friendly, and doesn't tell you what it's doing when you put your information in -- I know taxes can be confusing, but I think the average user of one of these software programs has a general idea of what is going on and would like to have a little more control over the forms.  It doesn't let you know about any issues or mistakes until you get to the very end of the return process, so you have to go all the way back to fix small issues.  It kept adding unnecessary forms which incorrectly increased what we owed on taxes.  And finally, when I tried to file our returns, the program started crashing every time I tried to do so.  I would not recommend this to anybody for any reason.
393	-1	I join all others in protest of Intuit Turbo Tax removal of the schedules for 2014 tax year. It's really not so much about the money, but the TIME I have to spend screwing around with this issue.
394	-1	you can not upload pics to other programs to print or anything from this . It does not do anything differently after you pay for it. It is a waste of money.
395	1	Good, easy to use for personal accounts
396	-1	I've been looking for blu-ray player software for a very long time. This one always ends up being what I choose to use. I even downloaded an evaluation copy and watched Spartacus on Blu-ray and it worked great, for a month. That was over a year ago.<br /><br />Then I thought, maybe I will be this software. But every time I look, the price changes!!! Tonight I was almost resigned to pay the $49.99 price for downloading, and now tonight it's $63.XX ?? WTF? Every time I look at this software it is a different price, sometimes varying by $10 or $20. There was one point, about August 2014, where it was $35.99. Never again, what is going on?
397	1	Used for a Christmas collage. Worked well
398	-1	Had Kaspersky before and will go back after using this program. Purchased based on professional reviews and have been disappointed by the interface and annoying auto features.
399	0	I was not planning to review this product BEFORE I finished my taxes, but I feel that others need to be aware of a couple shortcomings.  The product comes as two SEPARATE products, and they are coded/written by separate entities. The Premium product seems OK so far, but the Business product has issues. I was told it is the Business product that is outsourced.  The most pressing issue is the false advertising of the Business product. As of this moment while I'm writing this review, the H&R Block and Amazon websites still show the inaccuracies. The Business product DOES NOT IMPORT past tax files from TurboTax as they claim. This import ability of past TurboTax files is NOT part of the Business product!!!  Secondly, I'm not sure where their update server for the Business product is located, but it is also different from the Premium product. I do not have the time to figure out exactly where (guessing overseas), but when updating the Business product it takes a very long time. It takes a few minutes to connect and decide if there is anything to download. I'm on a 100Mbps Internet connection, so I'm confident it is not on my end. The Premium product updates in just a few seconds.  After contacting H&R Block At Home technical support by telephone they offered to refund me the cost of the product. I decided to hold onto it for now; although, I will have to manually enter my corporate taxes by hand due to the inability to import my TurboTax file from last year.  My review may change once I've completely my taxes and have further details on the functionality of both products.
400	0	After converting data from Windows based QuickBooks everything went smoothly at first, then suddenly data was unaccessible.  Was in a loop of backing up files and then being unable to open due to lack of permission.  Had to finally contact third-party tech support to solve the problem.  Do like that this newer version doesn't ask about saving changes after adding to a deposit.  Had some problems when trying to export a Transaction Report to Excel.  There is no browse feature in the dialogue box to select an Excel notebook.  Had to go back and forth between exporting from QB and importing in Excel before finally getting what was needed.  Hopefully things will run smoother in the future.
401	1	Being new to Mac's I have a bit of a learning curve going to this layout. It work with all of my companies spreadsheet and love the way it works with my Mac.
402	-1	This product is no longer free and has some serious ethical issues on how it collects revenue. I tried to cancel auto renew and you CANT do this from your normal account management page, They have created a complicated path which involves a new password (which doesnt work) - stay clear. As some other reviwer said this anti virus product has itself become infected.
403	1	Been using this brand for years with no problem.
404	0	ok
405	0	"You get an immense amount of value in Premiere Elements 12. There is nothing better on the market -- it's a \\""buy\\"" -- especially if you can get version 12 at a discount, now that version 13 is out.  Having said that, Adobe has not improved the overall \\""Expert\\"" timeline editing experience from version 10 -- and that's a bitter disappointment because I spend hours every day using this program.    I edit with a digitizing tablet, not a mouse, so one would figure I should have a higher degree of control and precision as I edit a scene.  In fact, the little nodes or handles or whatever you call them are nearly impossible to \\""grab\\"" with the cursor -- I am referring to keyframe controls, bezier controls, and other interface essentials.  And though today's screens are at higher resolutions than ever, for some reason, Adobe has still kept the \\""views\\"" of the Expert timeline at practically sub-viewable, sub-usable sizes -- even the \\""big\\"" size is small and frustratingly non-usable.  The end of all this is you end up making changes to interface elements you never meant to change -- and then you must CTRL-Z undo-undo-undo until you're back where you wanted to be.  While the clock is running and the deadline is approaching.    With the greatest of respect and admiration for Adobe as a company (I've been using Photoshop since version 2.5) you would think they would be able to make Premiere Elements as great as their other products.  I have not lost faith that they will do so in future versions, but it's a program that seems to have escaped the attention of their clearly qualified usability experts."
406	-1	This antivirus has either been corrupted or doesn't work. I installed it and soon after 3 days later my whole computer takes 30 minutes just to load the log in screen and then another 30 minutes to load the programs and desktop short cuts. I have done researched on this and now know that it is the cause of the anti virus as I have uninstalled it and I no longer have issues. I have running an Asus x79 deluxe with 32gb ram an i7 processor putting out 4.3 GHz and a NVIDIA GTX 780ti. The OS is running of a 256gb Samsung 800series SSD drive. Never had a slow load issues before until I installed this antivirus.
407	-1	Not user friendly, and missing a lot of features that the Windows equivalent has. Much better off using the Apple iWorks programs. (Pages, Numbers, Keynotes)
408	1	I have been using this product for years and will continue to use it for years to come. The ease of downloading it from Amazon Dot Com and the discount that TurboTax gave on the download were added bonuses.
409	0	Needed a newer version of Quickbooks for the new laptop. This works fine, but looks so different from the old version that some things are difficult to figure out. I know that they feel like they have to make it look like they are making substantial changes, but there is some value in making things easy for the user.
410	0	"I just completed my tax returns for 2010 using this software.  In previous years, I had used TurboTax when I did my own tax preparation.      Taxcut is similar to TurboTax in using the standard Q&A format but I found Taxcut more difficult to use and the UI more difficult to move around in.  You have to go through sections you have completed all over again to get to to certain functions.    I was initially going to file a Federal tax exemption but subsequently decided to file a full return with a partial payment.  But then I discovered that Taxcut would not let me specify an amount that I wanted to send.  It is all or nothing!      Printing is weak in Taxcut.  I have a duplex printer and I was not sure if Taxcut would print the forms correctly.  I finally solved this problem by printing the forms to PDF, where I could then ensure that they printed correctly.    Printing to a PDF also allowed me to edit the amount I was remitting at this time.  I would recommend that people print to a PDF and then print the submission yourself.    Before I decided not to submit a Federal extension, I thought that I might just e-file.  But then I discovered that the 5 free Federal e-files that come with the program only work for FULL returns.  If you want to e-file a Federal extension, then you have to pay $19.95!  That doesn't make any sense.    I was also mystified as to where I inputted the \\""keycode\\"" for Federal e-files.  I eventually discovered that this code was inputted when you FILED your Federal tax return.    I never did figure out how to print copies (again, which is why I printed to PDF).    I also called \\""support\\"" while trying to figure out how some things worked.  The wait was less than one minute, which was very good.  Unfortunately, the person I spoke to (clearly an American) seemed to know less than me.    Next time, I will probably pass Taxcut by and use TurboTax.    P.S. I had to enter this review in IE8 because Amazon would not allow me to enter a rating in Firefox.Sheese."
411	0	I came to know later that I could have got the same license for even cheaper price in other places. Felt a bit overpriced even after discount.
412	0	NIS has been my product of choice for many years. Amazon's online delivery was great. Unfortunately, I purchased this product for use on my Windows 8 machine. Norton did a very poor job of adapting its product to Win 8. Finally, after many phone calls and many hot patches and 4 months late, the software works correctly. I'm very disappointed with Norton in the way it handled the change to the Windows 8 operating system.
413	-1	you have to copy and past and copy and paste to download more then one video ....flv you can download the whole playlist
414	-1	The product did not meet my needs. It would not print invoices for tenants and customization of forms was limited. I called quicken and they promptly sent a refund, so no harm.
415	-1	What a huge disappointment. First of all, I messed up by not reading the reviews. I have been using Turbotax for years, and I didn't pay attention to the poor ratings before I ordered this product this year. I DO NOT OWN MY OWN BUSINESS, so I would not ever think I would have to purchase the software for business owners. However, I am unable to deduct $300 of expenses for a miscellaneous side job through a small company (THAT I DO NOT OWN) because I purchased this software and not the one for business owners. Upon trying to enter miscellaneous expenses, I was asked to purchase a $40 upgrade by phone (after already spending almost $50 on the software). Then, I stayed on the phone for around 55 minutes total (includes being transferred to a level 2 customer service person and being on hold for customer service people to find answers). Yet, there was nothing that could be done to keep me from paying the $40 to upgrade price. Please do not make the same mistake that I did and buy this software because it is the trusted, reliable tax software that you have always used. It has changed, and they are out for your money.
416	-1	"I purchased the download version because I thought it would be easy and save time and money.  After getting the Amazon downloader installed, the product download stalled at 79% and after about 20 minutes, I canceled and restarted it.  This one completed successfully.  Next the installer had an error that said \\""Cannot connect to the database\\"".  After moving the installer to the desktop and retrying 3 times, (including allowing Windows 7 to automatically try to re-install), I finally got the program installed.  Next came the federal update download which also stalled at about 80%.  While I sat waiting (again), I figured I'd write a review on Amazon.  Once I actually get to do my taxes, I'll try to update this review with an actual product review. For those who waited until April to buy the software and do taxes - good luck getting it downloaded and installed."
417	-1	I have never been able to install it as it needs office 2013 which I have not yet received.
418	-1	Quicken used to rock, and with every update their program got worse and more complicated  from ergonomical and workflow standpoint.  Their current version for mac is 7 years old and bites for the Mac user, everyone's jumping from the Quicken sinking ship.  I even bought this PC version just to give a report to my accountant and to see if they were partial to PC users (which they are) and attempted an export from Mac to the PC version..  wouldn't take the export so I'm left with a fat useless program to be &#34;uninstalled&#34; asap.  Customer service stumped and hung up on me because it was closing time in Delhi.  Your days are numbered Quicken.
419	1	I have been using this turbo tax now for about 6 years. But if I had stocks to sell, I would go on line and get H+R block deluxe because it is much cheaper. A little greed by turbo tax. You always want more.
420	1	just what I expected. I use it every year.
421	0	Trend Micro came with my wife's computer 2 years ago and she prefers to stick with it as she doesn't like change. I prefer another product.  She has not had any computer virus problems but then again email is her most dangerous adventure.
422	0	It very slow
423	-1	Such an awful product. It's sad that Intuit does not recognize that Windows users are converting to Mac and they could keep customers if they supported that conversion. There are financial institutions that I could connect to in Windows, that can't connect in Mac. And Essentials means that investing data is completely lost. If they had a more expensive version for Mac that had the features I lost, I would have bought it. But now I am just offended that they would sell this as a &#34;product&#34;.
424	0	Quickbooks is still the best out there for small business. Even though the online companies are trying, they aren't there yet.  To bad they can't make this work for a MAC the same way.<br /><br />We purchased the upgrade and had problems converting files to TurboTax, so we went back to an accountant.<br /><br />The new interface is easier to use and the auto bill features work great if you offer monthly services.  Will I buy the next version?  We'll see if it is MAC ready or if the online guys catch up.  I do like my data on my computers though.....
425	-1	I ran this program as soon as i downloaded it,,, and then had to download the whole thing again with updates. It worked fine as TurboTax usually does. But then I noticed 4 days after filing taxes and quitting the program that it was still running in the background, using 33% of my CPU! ugh. Double check on your Mac using Activity Monitor when you're done to see if your version does the same.
426	0	TurboTax gives the feeling that you are getting your taxes done with no risk of making mistakes. With the new healthcare laws, glad did not have to figure that out. Wish government would simplify tax laws so do not have to buy this software OR use a tax accountant to fill out annual taxes!
427	-1	Tried to charge me $20 extra when original description said Fed + State E-file.  I will say no to Turbo Tax next year.
428	-1	Should have known better since it was free... My computer kept freezing and prevented me from using my internet.
429	-1	Converted swfs and gifs are terrible. The quality is lowered drasticlly and the frame timing gets messed up. Freemake Video Converter gives better results and its free.
430	-1	I should have read the reviews. Don't buy this product if you need a Schedule C or K-1. Actually don't buy this product at all given the mess intutit has made of their product. They deserve to disappear off the face of the earth for being greedy, stupid people. I have been using TurboTax for years but due to a computer crash I lost the 2013 version. Now I have to download 2013 again from Amazon and reload it so that I can get the upgrade that shouldn't be needed in the first place. This is after spending time trying to figure out what was going wrong and then dealing with Turbotax not being able to connect to the Internet though I was able to get on to everyone else's site without a problem.  Thanks to the people at Intuit that have wasted an awful lot of my time, a terrible review is the least I can do to return the favor.  BTW... Intuit is offering a $25 rebate to try to correct for their sins. Problem is the needed upgrade cost $30 (assuming you can get the stupid program to recognize your Internet connection) so it still costs you more. They should be paying us and firing everyone responsible for this stupid move.  Update: Got Intuit to upgrade to Premier with the help of an Amazon (Thanks Amazon!) so I could enter a Sch K-1. Got to the very next section and found that you can no longer enter a Sch C with either the Deluxe or the Premier Editions and that there is another $10 charge to &#34;upgrade&#34; to do so. Well Intuit, I think as little of you as you think of your customers - of which I will never be one again.
431	0	PanitShop Pro X5 is good, not many changes from the previous editions. I decided to purchase the ultimate edition to get the face filter studio, but it was just junk bundle software. The software that they bundle is not even the full edition and its old. I would recommend anybody purchasing PainShop  to go with the Pro edition and skip the Ultimate, not worth the extra money.<br />In regards to Corel PaintShop Pro X5, I like the software, its easy to use, what I did not like is all the pop up advertisements to purchase additional software from corel. The ads pop up when you close the program and when launching it. This is a major negative issue and corel should stop doing that, you already purchased it so why give us the ads...
432	-1	It could not be installed in my 32 bit Windows XP, and totally useless for me. But fortunately, I don't need to pay.
433	-1	I have been charged 49.95 for this service even though I haven't used Bitdefender since May.  Now they won't deal with me request to stop this.
434	-1	Too simple. Actually even less instruction than the basic eMedia guitar. A bunch of simple chromatic scales.<br /><br />Only two songs with bending. Very bad.
435	-1	Not happy about having to use the premier version this year........mebby it's time for H&R Block !
436	-1	I've been using H&R block software for years, never had any issues. Unfortunately with the 2013 version, it won't update. The updater simply says 'Gathering Information' (it's been about 4 hours now). It does with both the automatic updates and manually downloaded updates.<br /><br />Off to buy Turbo Tax.
437	1	Loved it easy and fast
438	-1	slows down my mac to a crawl. won't renew norton internet security.
439	0	"According to the Quickbooks 2012 Knowledge base on their website:<br />\\""Sample company files<br />QuickBooks has the following sample files that you can use as examples for setting up your own QuickBooks company...<br />Sample consulting business, Sample engineering or architecture firm, Sample graphic design or advertising agency, and Sample law firm are sample company files with data designed for professional service businesses. For example, the Item list in each sample file contains items for services typically performed by that particular professional business.\\""<br /><br />These files ARE NOT in the Pro version of the program. Their website is wrong.<br /><br />If you plan on downloading the app and buy the wrong version note:<br />QuickBooks Pro 2012 [Download]<br />Sold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.<br />This item is not eligible for return.<br /><br />They do not state this on their returns page nor on the product page. If you got to the returns section of the site and try to make an attempt to return the product you'll see that nice little message.<br /><br />The Pro version is quite a bit lacking in regard to what I was expecting. It is at best a very simple flat accounting program designed to make it easy for accountants to not have to do any accounting. If you are in any other industry and you purchase this version you will either need to purchase a version that has example files (Premier) or you will need to hire an accounting firm to have them help you with the setup unless you've always been dreaming of becoming an accountant. They do have tutorials (hours and hours of them) but you will more than likely need something else. From other reviews I've been reading on the web in hind site, the larger versions (not pro) actually make it easier for you to do what I was expecting to with this particular version.<br /><br />I'm really surprised that I was not able to cancel my license on the Amazon site. I will be contacting Intuit to see if I can get a refund for the incorrect purchase. My bad... why would I ever believe something I read on a company's own website?<br /><br />Oh, and from everything else I've read their support is horrible and in some other country. When I was trying to find out where the mysterious sample files mentioned on their site were it, someone said it took 4 support people before they finally figured out that those files were not included in my version and that they weren't there by design. They need to fix their website and train their support staff."
440	-1	Bank transaction download is a pain in the butt. I deleted the password vault but the program insists on asking for an Intuit password every time I try to update transaction from the bank. Sometime the update will process and sometimes it cancels itself. Ready to give up and find another solution for banking.
441	0	Down loading transactions is a mess, hope you get it fixed soon
442	0	This works just as well as any free software you can get, I would definitely get something else! Norton is not that great.
443	0	The program works fine. I just thought it was a little too much to have to pay extra for the version of Turbo Tax that included the sate forms, and then having to pay extra again to file the state tax using Turbo Tax. It's a lot like being taxed twice for the same item.
444	-1	I bought this program for video editing. It was the worst program I have used. When I import a video file it will automatically try to correct the aspect ratio, then the pitch of the video will change. It was very weird. I called customer service and they gave me a refund because they could not find a solution for the problem. This program has been around too long for them not to get it right.
445	1	I like the upgrade for the Mac and it's becoming closer to my older Window's version. I use the Window's version simply for historical data and now use this version on my Macbook. I especially like being able to sync between my iPhone app and my Mac. To me, that's the ultimate convenience. With the discount offered, I felt the value jumped from 3/4 to 5 stars.
446	1	I needed asap for kids homework..so I purchased & downloaded with ease. I really just needed the basics office..word, excel.
447	0	If you like 8.1 this is a good deal.
448	0	I found that this years Turbo Tax was more difficult to use than last years. I had to enter my data more than once. The history sheets were to small.
449	0	I use the Editor that guides you as the full editor is very confusing to me.  Good piece of software, but hard to use.
450	-1	I have always used turbo tax since 2014.  They got arrogant and disabled forms from the basic Tubro Tax.  I purchased the basic then tried to import my taxes as I have done every year earlier.  It told me I could not go further unless i upgraded.  The upgrade was as much as the disc from walmart.  This is the last year I will use this product, the others are half the price.
451	0	I wanted to download this much sooner once I was unable to download my bank transactions with my 2011 version.  However, with all the disastrous reviews I waited as long as I could.  They must have gotten a lot of the bugs out because so far I have not had any issues (it's been about 4 weeks now).
452	-1	too much crap attached
453	1	Unless you have an exceptionally complex taxes, Turbo Tax Deluxe will get the job done.  A product that has has years to develop and has evolved very. very well.
454	-1	... is a bit of a laugh.<br /><br />Terrible implementation of reports, input of transactions is pathetic. Literally!<br /><br />How do you get away with this level of junk work and coding?
455	-1	I have been running Quicken for several years on my MAC using Parallels. Quicken sent me a message that they were no longer going to allow bank updates after April, so I needed to upgrade. I did so or at least I tried. The install program would not work so I had to delete a framework program and reinstall it directly from Microsoft. I finally got my Quicken installed and now it will no longer load.<br /><br />Spent lots of time with the &#34;Ace&#34; quicken support team until they finally said it was not their problem...<br /><br />Wonderful program and even better customer support
456	0	Its a MS application on Mac and has a few differences. I really just needed this quickly for files I received to edit/comment. The purchase experience to buy and download went easy. The only problem with these Apps is that they have a memory leak and slowly your Mac starts to slow down if you keep running for days like I do. Just quit the App with Force and then restart. They need to fix this.
457	0	It would not do Affordable Health Care Act (ie. Obama Care) calculations for a self employed person.
458	1	the best as far as I am concerned
459	0	I am still having problem getting ebooks transferred to my kindle paperwhite I just bought
460	0	Not super user friendly.  The Help section is less than helpful.  I think overall, TurboTax is better for DIY.
461	1	"Program and download process works as advertized.  I was reluctant to install the \\""Amazon Games & Software Downloader\\"", it seems unnecessarily intrusive.  I de-installed it and the TaxCut program continues to work..."
462	0	To expensive, but it works.
463	1	Excellent product
464	1	A + Sell
465	1	Works as expected.  Although I'm having trouble opening a prior year's file to see how I did something and I still have the prior year's version on my computer
466	-1	Buggy!
467	0	If you're an average user this review is not for you and you should still buy this product. This will protect your facebooks and twitters without using up all your geebees.<br /><br />I've always liked Kaspersky AV because it was minimal and just sat in the background without interrupting what you're doing. 2013 had a few new things that got in the way but you could either disable them or their notifications to not annoy you. 2014 is a different story. Most of the new features I don't mind that much after tweaking but the forced Chrome extension is unacceptable. I get where they're going with this but I had to go WAY out of my way to disable it and get it to stop reinstalling. After a Chrome update it installs itself again. I've been using Kaspersky for a very long time and the product is pretty solid but that's a deal killer for me. Part of this is just nerd rage not wanting things I didn't install running on my system but there is a noticeable performance decrease with this plugin runnning.<br /><br />Make a power user friendly version Kaspersky. You used to be very power user friendly but after 2012 it's been a roller coaster shooting down hill and you're just about at the end now.
468	0	Acrobat is one of those software programs you HAVE to have for certain industries and jobs.  The functionality is great.  I can do my OCR, edit and comment on PDFs, etc...<br /><br />But the User Interface Design is absolutely terrible!  Example - you want to OCR some files?  You have to open up a PDF first.  Any PDF - doesn't matter which.  Then, when you click OCR multiple files, the PDF file you have open isn't on the default list of PDFs to OCR.  Did I mention you can't OCR multiple files without first opening a file?  Dumbest UI design ever.
469	-1	To many reasons.  I'm hoping 2014 is not.  Seems intuit now wants to charge you to send files to your accountant.
470	1	This is easy to use and not too complicated. It still takes a learning curve but with a little time I'm sure I will be content with using it.
471	0	Quicken has a lot of positives and I use it all the time. I have two problems. the reports and some of the home page display charts are kind of mediocre. For example, the dates on the net worth report need to be reset all the time even though &#34;Custom to date&#34; is selected. also there is no way to hide a closed account in the Investment accounts report with out taking it completely out of all reports. The most annoying problem is that for most downloaded transactions I need to enter information twice to get it accepted. The program behaves as if the mouse is somewhere else when you click on &#34;accept or save&#34; and essentially deselects the transaction and deletes any entries I have made. I have had this problem off and (mostly) on for three versions. Quicken has a standard answer for this complaint which is that the file is corrupted. your only option is to start over with a new file and reconstruct several years of data which is not a real option. I just can't believe they can't fix this problem
472	0	There are many bugs. I had to turn off the sync to use on my tablet and phone because there were too many times that the data did not copy over.
473	0	Very disappointed in Turbo Tax because they removed Schedule C and others from Turbo Tax Deluxe..Will not purchase again.
474	-1	I have to restore my system multiple times. Spent 3 hours and product is still not working. Instead of protecting I think I put my computer at risk by buying this product
475	1	Really useful
476	0	I bought this product for my wife who needed a refresher on Office 2010. She found it difficult to use, quite unclear at times and the interface is not user friendly. Eventually she gave up and started using other free products online.
477	0	It did not separate out Pa and DE state taxes. We  ended up doing both by hand.
478	1	works very well. high confidence
479	1	been using this for years. It does the job!
480	-1	In doing my returns I chose to use the simplified deduction (safe harbor deduction) for my home office.  I only have one home office and this should have been a simple thing for the program to handle.  The return was finished with no errors, but when I went to electronically file the program blocked itself from filing saying that there was an error on line 30 of the schedule C, that the amount could not be more than $1,500 (which is correct with this simplified deduction).  But my line 30 was $1,125.  Now, most CPA's would agree that $1,125 is less than $1,500, but H&R's Tax Block is struggling with that.<br /><br />I used chat to talk to support.  He said that it is a known issue and SHOULD be fixed sometime in February.  He said that I have two options now.  1) Print and file on paper.  2) Wait for the update.  I said that it not acceptable.  He asked me to send a copy of the receipt to their corporate offices, and wait for weeks to get a refund.<br /><br />So...  This product may not be able to get everything done that you want.  Just a buyer beware.
481	0	As simple to use as always.  However, I find it deceiving that they say 'FREE' federal e-file and 1 'FREE' State e-file.  This is FALSE !  There are fees with everything you do with this program.  If you e-file, you WILL pay a fee of some type to someone using this program.  And I did NOT get a return, I still paid in more to both state & federal... Again, it is easy to use.  They even offer protection for your return (at $44.95 !)... Just keep that in mind...
482	1	Much improved over previous versions.  Some of the reporting is restrictive and the alerts are not accurate (I rarely use them).  Overall improvement.  The Iphone app could be much more functional - not sure why they limit it some much.  It basically allows you to view the accounts.
483	1	"I'm learning that Final Draft is the industry standard for screenwriting or even just short video writing, and it's easy to see why. It's purpose-built just for that task, with common script elements built in as well as help with formatting and common issues like that. But it is kinda tweaky every once in a while with things like text page breaks and display issues. Nothing major, but just enough to make you stop and wonder what's going on.  My only other complain (so far) would be that the keyboard shortcuts to screen elements aren't very intuitive for me. I might be off on this being fairly new to the craft, but it seems like they could make it a little quicker to select different elements without having to remember: \\""Was Dialogue command-3? Or 4?\\"" Things of that sort.  Overall it's been very easy to use and even let me import a screenplay I'd created in another application (after converting it to .rtf), and it did a fairly decent job of reading the formatting from that. So yes, I'd definitely recommend it. But it could also be improved upon."
484	-1	The package does not work,  I had to buy the same software from H&R block website. And even later the initial loaded software created lots of problem for the new one. Normally, I do not post any product review but this time I had to do as I wasted so much time in addition to the frustration.
485	1	I was not certain if I should shell out big bucks for Photoshop CS6 or go with the less expensive simpler product.  I am very happy with Elements 11.  It has the features that I need and it has helped me improve the photos that I place on various web sights.  I took an Elements class at a local community college and that also helped me get rolling.<br /><br />One feature that I especially appreciate is the &#34;guided&#34; menu.  Most of the things that I do are on the &#34;guided&#34; list and it has helped me develop a systematic approach to adjusting my images.  I especially like that while in the guided mode the actions I take are captured in layers.  Thus I can go back and adjust an individual layer if I wish.<br /><br />All in all this inexpensive package has exceeded my expectations.  I am very pleased.<br /><br />Downloading the software from the Amazon site also went well.  No glitches.  It was rather lengthy as my DSL access speed is not a zippy as Cable...
486	-1	DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE! I have been using Turbo Tax for 15 years. and this is the last year. Right off the bat it imported the data from last years return and it swapped my employer with my wife's. The only way to correct it is to delete and re-enter manually. And now I have to worry about what else the software screwed up. Pretty stupid from a company called Intuit. With H&R Block nipping at your heels you make a stupid mistake like this? Next year it's H&R Block for this taxpayer. TURBO TAX SUCKS!
487	-1	I upload the first time and had issues with old files I had to remove from my computer.  Once I did that, I tried to enter the key code and the website stated the code was incorrect each time I logged in...so I lost my money.
488	-1	There are so few options for financial software for mac; I decided to try this out assuming (incorrectly) that if it wasn't right for my needs I could return it.<br /><br />Not only is it not right, IT DOESN'T WORK. Some of the basic functions don't function at all.<br /><br />And no, I can't return it. So I'm out $60, and there doesn't seem to be any recourse available to me. Totally unhelpful.<br /><br />It's unfortunate: As a result of this experience I'll never feel confident purchasing an unfamiliar software package again.
489	1	To me, Norton is the best all round protection
490	-1	I need the 64 version for my pc, I can't download this one
491	0	Very nice features, menus and transitions and burn options. Very slow in complying projects, time left counter extremely inaccurate. Found it difficulty and frustrating  to stop and edit a frame (returns to beginning of project). I've cant get project to do a shadowed picture (picture over a picture).
492	0	I have been using the Deluxe version for at least 8 years and just discovered that this year's version does not have the Sch D or the 8949 and I now have to pay an extra $30 to upgrade. Had I known of this change up front, it wouldn't have cost as much for me to purchase the Premier version. At this time, I'm not very happy about it.
493	0	more difficult to use than previous versions - wasn't able to incorporateinformation from previous tax returns - will have to &#34;think hard&#34; before purchasing again next year.
494	-1	Loader this software and just after my computer froze. Completely...not only alt-ctl-del would respond. Restarted 4 or 5 times, each time I opened a program thing would happened. Restarted, did an immediate &#34;restore&#34; and eliminated Avast from my computer. Working again than god.
495	0	It came free with my used laptop and i wasn't too sure about it last wk when it notified me it stopped a few attacks to my system. That definitely made me feel protected.
496	1	The 2014 TurboTax was changed slightly from prior years relative to input, but I was able to adapt quickly and input was quite simple.  Since 2013 I had changed computers and was not able to carry forward some of the input such as charitable giving addresses, but this was not a factor in TurboTax performance.  Overall I was again fully satisfied with the performance, speed and accuracy of TurboTax.  I was very confident that my taxes had been accurately and carefully computed.  I recommend it as an excellent product!
497	1	Love it!  Five star!  This would be good at any price - awesome that it's free.  No problems with viruses since I installed Avast.
498	0	Program itself worked fine but when tried to do efile on state it would not work with credit card. Did it last year with no problem. I then went ahead and did the deduction from fed to pay efile cost and was stunned to see the service fee they charged.  Have been a turbo tax customer since they first went on line  but  may look for other option next year.  Again, problem worked fine but not at all happy with efile. (Fed worked fine)
499	0	The wording in the advertisement is misleading. You can download and e-file federal. It doesn't allow me to download a state product without paying an addition $45. The write-up makes it sound like one state product is free that you can then print but doesn't appear to be the case as every time I try to work on it it takes me to their purchase page. Long time Turbo Tax customer but will move over to HR Block next year with incredible increase in state filing cost and misleading advertising.
500	0	I give this 3 stars because they make you purchase a new edition every 3 years if you want to download transactions from your bank. I only use it for my checking account but I still had to buy the deluxe edition because that's what I have been using for a couple of decades now, and you cannot convert your existing Quicken files to a less expensive version. However, the program itself works fine and the download went without a hitch.
501	-1	I hate the new GUI (look and feel).  Yes it is the latest version, but the learning curve for the entire suite is quite large.  Change is inevitable...
502	0	Usability is huge.  Love it.<br /><br />But, I hate that it does not integrate with my Schwab bank and recently was having trouble communicating with my community bank.  Customer support is poor.
503	0	Can't convert older version file to this version
504	1	I figured it out. Yay me!<br />And it worked….so happy that I did not lose those photos from my phone. I’ve been sad about it for two weeks. Just found your software tonight and I’m going to bed happy. THANKS!!
505	0	did not work for me...too complicated
506	-1	"This is the first year I have tried the H&R Block program.  I was tired of the Intuit games with their TurboTax program - in all the years I used TurboTax, I NEVER received a promised rebate and the State filing fees were getting out of hand.  There were other unexpected charges too, but this review isn't the forum for that.    I decided to try H&R Block's software for a change even though I liked TurboTax.  H&R Block was much easier to use for those who enjoy the step-by-step walk-through.  In many ways, the explanation of the tax codes for decision points people reached were very easy to understand.  It even took the TurboTax files form the previous year and flawlessly transferred the data to H&R Block's software for this year's return.    The one major flaw in this software is when one makes an itemized list for a field, the list can not be edited or even reopened once closed.  Every time I tried to bring up an itemized list from any field, the program would crash with the dreaded \\""H&R Block quit unexpectedly\\"" error.  All data entered after the previous save was lost.  This was very frustrating as there is no way to edit an itemized list once added.  This was an every time event - no matter which field I entered an itemized list for - I even started an entirely new return to see if that would fix it.  It didn't.  I then went to the web site and found no way to provide feedback on the issue.  There was no support area for this either.  The only support areas were for tax questions and installation issues.  I had to revert to using Excel for my itemized lists to add things up before entering the final number in the proper tax field.  This software bug cost H&R Block two stars.  Other than that, it appeared to be a good software package - on par with TurboTax but without the Intuit hidden cost issues.    Jim    Update: Attempted to access the forms directly.  I opened the 1040 with no problem, but when I tried to access a link to another form, the wrong form kept popping up (tried to access Form 8863 (American Opportunity Credit) and instead it opened Form 8812 (Additional Child Tax Credit).  And when a field is selected, the form jumps around.  H&R Block sent me a link to a new, improved version.  All the same issues remained in the newest version.  Lowered to Two Stars.    Update 2: Decided I had enough of the buggy program and wanted to return it.  Found the 60-day guarantee, but no way to submit for it.  Called H&R Block to obtain a refund.  After about 20 minutes of looking on their database, the customer service representative said she could find no way to refund the money and that I needed to contact Amazon for the refund, but Amazon won't refund on a downloaded piece of software.  After 40 minutes on the phone, information was taken and H&R Block said they would elevate it to the next level.  I am now waiting for a phone call back.  Although very nice on the phone, the H&R Rep was clueless.  Rating now one-star - wish there was a zero star rating."
507	0	I've been using Quicken for quite some time and I do not update every year, usually every 2 to 3 and this version is not much different than the 2011. Matter of fact it has some new features I do not like.
508	0	If you are checking this out to consider a change from Turbo Tax (TT) for the 2015 taxes because of what they did for their 2014 tax programs you may be disappointed with TaxACT (TA), unless they improve the 2015 tax programs considerably.  If you have used TT for a few years and do anything at all a bit complex you will definitely be disappointed with TA.  If you only need the basics you were probably not affected by the TT scam and still think they are wonderful and you will probably be happy with TA too, but TT still has a better more helpful interview process and when those more slightly more complex issues popped up there was help with them and hopefully there will be again next year.<br /><br />I didn't buy software for 2014 taxes until Feb 2015 and had the benefit of seeing many of the reviews and comments on TT Deluxe so in spite of being a TT user for more than 30 years I bought the H&R Block Deluxe (H&R).  Now I know why they were number 2 for so long and now I would rate them number 3.  TA is better and rated number one on PCmag.com the last two years, but after using it I would disagree with that rating.  If you need much on those C, D & E schedules TT Deluxe did a much better job for the 2013 tax year.  I didn't use it this year but I would bet it was better if you made the switch to Premier or didn’t need those schedules.<br /><br />The H&R software has a crappy interview with very little in the way of built in help or available on the web site. Their online chat help is not available except during what is little more than normal business hours even late in the tax season. That is the main source of tax help and is all they offer for what they call professional help. The customer service number which only deals with using the software is open only a couple hours longer. With the shift from TT that occurred this year both are way overloaded. I must say though the customer service person I finally reached was much more help than anyone I talked to at TA after I made that purchase.<br /><br />With H&R some things I saw instead of help actually said &#34;See your tax professional&#34;. Anyone out there using DIY tax software that also has a tax professional?  Other help for fairly common things simply take you to the dot gov web site page and for some the help just takes you to the built in form.<br /><br />The kicker for me, the H&R does not handle K-1 partnerships at all.  I am referring to the kind of partnership that should be done with Schedule C, D & A for Limited Partnerships you bought stock in.  It doesn't even suggest buying their more expensive version for K-1's so I don't think that does K-1's either. The program simply says you have to fill that in yourself, it is too complex for the software.  Isn’t that why we buy tax software?  I gave up on it and went looking again.<br /><br />After seeing the number one rating on PCmag.com for TaxACT, looking at the TA web site and talking to their customer service about K-1's, I bought the TA Deluxe Ultimate Bundle download here.  Before the purchase they were very nice and helpful, not so much when I had a question after I owned it.  I am VERY disappointed in TA.  TA has a more limited interview process than TT.  They call it Q&A, but there is little in the form of questions and limited help or explanations, but it is better than H&R.  TA advertises on their web site that they include all forms that can be e-filed.  That is at best deceptive advertising, since half of them are not usable directly in the program or there is no or limited calculations for them in the program.  Also TA claims “All the free help & support you need, when you need it” however you have to pay for some of it.  It is just that it is included in this bundle and the TA web site calls it professional help implying they are tax professionals.  It is neither professional nor tax help.  They will help you with use of the program, but that isn’t hard since it doesn’t do a lot.<br /><br />In the more complex parts of the A, C, D schedules and some other areas it offers no help with the calculations and just offers you a place to input what you think belongs there.  For the Miscellaneous Deductions section of Schedule A the most commonly used schedule there is, TA offered NO help for depreciation calculations for computer equipment used for investing.  Those calculations are complex and require information from years past.  TT has in years past always provided a version of the forms that would feed into Schedule C if it were business depreciation expense and then instead put the results in at that point in Schedule A.  In the process it produced worksheets that saved the information needed for future years and provided a record of what your selections were for type of depreciation.  TA did not import any of that information from TT and left you to figure everything out manually on your own.  When I called the so called Professional phone support line I had paid extra for, after a long wait I was told sorry TA doesn’t do that and we don’t provide help with calculations, only with what TA does.  No amount of begging or insistence could get me to a supervisor or someone more knowledgeable.  The best I got was you can call Customer Service on Monday (this was Sat 4/11) and probably get your money back, like that would help me a lot at that point.  After searching and digging on their web site I finally found a suggested work around their UN-professional help person apparently did not know about, but even it was klutzy.  All it did was use the Schedule C forms and worksheets to generate the final number, which you had to write down to save, because then you had to DELETE the Schedule C.  Failing to delete it would include it in the e-file and create a bogus business the IRS would then think you had for real.  You don’t want to even imagine the pain that is going to cause.  What they don’t tell you is upon deleting Schedule C all the supportinginformation and numbers needed for future years also goes away unless you print it or save it to PDF first separate from your return.  Deleting that Schedule C still left several forms with my return that were totally blank or containing only my name.  In the end by the time I worked through it all and figured out how to make it work I might have been better off downloading TT Premier and starting over completely.  In any case by that time I was done I certainly was wishing I had.<br /><br />I was determined to never use TT again unless they fixed the scam they ran this year but maybe I should not have jumped ship so fast.  I agree with others that say a little more cost for TT could be tolerated, but be honest about what you’re doing and don’t force us to buy more than we need to get what we do need.  After sampling the competition I would also add, TT is definitely better than the competition but we are already paying more so don’t get greedy.  I despise the way TT handled things this year and I hope they do something better next year.  However TT is way better than the nearest competition and worth a little extra cost unless you don't need help with the complex calculations.<br /><br />If you don't have anything like K-1's, depreciation on a computer you use for investment, not even a little stock trading, etc. TaxACT may be a good choice.  But if you have never used TT you also may not know what you’re missing on your taxes.
509	0	There are features lacking in the Mac version of QB. Supposedly they will be up and running with the equivalent features as the PC version of QB. One can only hope this is true...
510	0	My download speed leveled out at a snail's 1.9 KB/s which is only 9+ hours to download.  Amazon - what the hell?  At least it is roughly 1/3 of the time to get the disk overnighted.<br /><br />Great program otherwise.  Fits my need exactly (homeowner with pesky permit office that wants permit and plans for everything - wireless security system included).
511	-1	I initially chose to file an extension with Federal.  Little did I know that once you select this option in H&R block software, it is hard coded....you cannot change it. You cannot delete the extension form.  It is impossible.  Same for the state software.  Why isn't this program more flexible?  I do not know if Turbo Tax is any better but that is what I plan to try next year.  Not H&R Block.
512	-1	I have used TurboTax for the past many years and have been quite satisfied with its performance--even this year, up to a point--and that is I have yet to get a printed copy of my 2014 tax return--I tried and tried with TurboTax's program to get one.  All I got was &#34;programming&#34; language and from I figured I needed Adobe to accomplish publishing by tax return--so I bough it at a cost to me of approx $168.00.  Still nothing and except for this printing problem I am very satisfied with TurboTax.  Will I go with you folks again next year--probably not!  IT COST ME TOO MUCH TO NOT EVEN GET A PRINTOUT
513	-1	Quicken 2013 Mobile Sync will compromise your data. Should never have been allowed to launch. Beta testers like myself BEGGED Intuit to not launch or to disable Mobile Sync, Intuit should have pulled the product from Amazon when the broad extent of data corruption became known (and pulled it back from retail) but instead, kept marketing it! Unconscionable. Even with R5, there are issues. These issues may extend beyond the use of Mobile Sync. Caveat Emptor.<br /><br />Example of issues.<br /><br />Splitting transactions after the fact will create a problem and change balances<br />Changing the categorization after the fact will create a problem<br />etc. and duplicate trannsactions on iOS<br /><br />Intuit knows of these issues and is silent. Or is giving scripted replies about how hard they are working to fix.  And they are still actively marketing 2013 and highlighting mobile sync when they should be warning it can corrupt data.<br /><br />Differences between iPhone and iPad apps - the iPhone app has more functionality (even though it doesn't work correctly) than the iPad app. For example, with a checking account there is a drop down to see Online Balance vs Ending Balance. However, Ending Balance incorrectly always reports $0. Nothing like this function on the iPad, all you get is Online Balance so you never know your real balance (on either app). So if you sit down and write checks and enter on the desktop, until they clear your bank and are downloaded, you really do not know how much money is in your checking account if you are using the mobile app. Zero usabiity.<br /><br />Enter a credit limit on the desktop for a credit card and mobile sync randomly deletes it from the desktop (and from the iPhone app). Usually connected with a pending transaction at the FI that has not yet come down via OSU. You can view the credit avaialble on the iPhone but not the iPad. (Well, when it has not been deleted). I suspect this would break credit limit alerts bigtime.<br /><br/>Missing critical functionality - cannot transfer money between accounts in iOS apps. So if you wanted to take ATM from your checking account and transfer to a Cash account, you cannot.<br /><br />Quicken 2013 - if you care about the integrity of your data, stay away!!!
514	0	I was so worried to buy this product when I checked some of the other reviews. Fortunately, I decided to check the descriptions and reasons for many negative reviews before ruling out Quicken Essentials for Mac.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />Easy to set up<br />Downloads and categorizes transactions from all my accounts<br />Easy to modify categories made automatically<br />Relatively inexpensive<br /><br />The Cons:<br />Somewhat weak report generating (I probably wouldn't use the more advanced ones anyway)<br />Doesn't sync with TurboTax (which I'm sure is annoying for people who use it)<br />Not quite as customizable as the PC versions (which is annoying for me)<br /><br />Basically, it's a more comprehensive version of Intuit's Mint.com. It seems less than ideal that their free service falls just short of satisfaction while their paid service for Mac is just satisfactory; however, everything I and most people really need should be covered in this program. I do recommend it for people looking for basic bookkeeping software that's easy to use. Don't worry about some of the poor reviews. They're mostly coming from people with higher expectations than the rest of us.
515	1	I am amazed what this software can do!  I had stressful situations with adware and so far this product has taken care of that and also has other care for my laptop to help clean it up and it runs like new again!!
516	0	This item could do a great job on Windows only! but my Apple Computer's Hard drive could not accepted.
517	0	"I purchased this software because it is compatible with my banking center.  However, I found it very difficult to reconcile my checking out.  I couldn't adjust the starting balance without entering a bogus \\""Adjustment\\"" or \\""Starting Balance Adjustment\\"" entry."
518	0	still learning to use it but so far its a beefier version of the windows movie maker but with a bunch more bells and whistles
519	-1	Day after day a new date for NY state efile functionality was given until i finally asked for a refund and went back to Turbo Tax which worked great
520	-1	"I was perfectly happy with Quicken 2012 but when I saw that 2013 had an iPad app I had to take the plunge. Throughout my day, I spend a lot of pocket cash that I often forget about, and the idea of being able to enter transactions directly on my iPad and then sync them when I got home was *very* appealing to me since I'd often end a month with a few hundred dollars in \\""pocket cash\\"" when my wallet only had $20 in it.<br /><br />However, the cloud experience just flat out does not work. I added all of my accounts, but when I log into the iPad App it tells me to go to my computer and add the accounts. I've tried cloud sync several times. After about 5 minutes, a window pops up that \\""Quicken has stopped responding\\"" with options to close the program or continue waiting. I picked \\""Continue\\"" then took my dogs for a walk, only to return 20 minutes later to the same message and I have a *VERY* fast Internet connection (it took about 1 minute to download the Quicken program itself).<br /><br />After doing some research on the web, I saw that a lot of users were not only having trouble with the iPad app, but were LOSING DATA. This thought terrifies me, so I temporarily turned off cloud sync.<br /><br />As for the rest of the app, nothing really new and exciting. It does what Quicken is supposed to do.<br /><br />I'm giving it two stars because the basic app itself is functional, but I feel Intuit has really misled the consumer into upgrading with the idea of a cloud-based iPad app when this app isn't working properly."
521	0	Unable to download software a second time. Guess I should have purchased the CD.
522	-1	You are basically a beta-tester for the moment. The credit score feature does not work (and no one can help you). The software is riddled with bugs (consistently crashes for multiple causes). The help desk was only able to help me lose 10 years worth of data. Stay away for now.
523	1	I haven't used Quicken for years because I did not like the lack of accounting basics. This product is a great improvement. It does almost everything for you.
524	-1	A week after I installed this, a moneypak virus came in through an old website link in my favorites bar that apparently has been corrupted.. I didn't download anything. AND I had installed all the online Norton Live Updates.<br /><br />Computer locked.<br />2.5 hours with Norton Support was a complete waste of time. By using tricks I learned off Google afterward, I was able to get my computer to run in Safe Mode. Still working on the problem.
525	1	I have used this service for several years and am ALWAYS happy with the results. Not too intrusive and always alert.
526	-1	I wanted this software to track my personal finances (including stock & retirement accounts) & it turns out it doesn't allow you to do this.  Is there any return options available?
527	-1	Due to circumstances both frustrating and infuriating, I found myself needing to buy, or rather buy the right to download, Office 2013.  In short, despite my 2-star &#34;I don't like it&#34; rating, I really hate this 'new' Office.<br />Stark, boxy, inelegant menus, an interface both clumsy and confusing;<br />Options moved around even more drastically than the prior Office interface revamps;<br />It's not compatible with XP (yes, I know Microsoft is abandoning XP, but I still have computers with the OS);<br />Application suite has a license for only one PC (guess that's why I shouldn't worry about backwards compatibility);<br />The relatively astronomical cost in comparison to what it delivers when compared to past editions;<br />The push for online everything.  If I wanted an online presence, if I wanted to store my stuff on a corporation's server, if I wanted my applications loaded onto my computer to ride my connection to tell Microsoft what I'm doing - but I don't, so stop trying to convince me how great and convenient it all would be.  Say hello instead to my firewall.<br />I also hate that I don't really have a copy of Office 2013, and I fear that the problems that forced me to 'upgrade' to 2013 will reoccur and force me to eat this rather expensive version and foist the next 'new and improved' iteration of Office onto my computer.<br />The actual content that I use (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) has worked so far.  Mostly.  This version seems to have a need to 'think' a bit longer than the 2010 version before executing a command; Excel has exhibited some instability and has crashed on rare occasions.  But nothing MAJOR.<br />I gave Office 2013 two stars, since there is some functionality buried in its shortcomings.  But this 'upgrade' is, in my opinion, no upgrade at all.
528	1	I have used this product for many years and it does what it's suppose to do along with some additional features not found in most other products like tune-up and loose-end registry clean-up.
529	-1	Every time I tried to download this , it failed to install because of a corrupted file.  I finally had to go to the Avast website to download and install this Antivirus program.  I love Avast, but rated the purchase(free) a one because it was useless to me.
530	1	I have had avast install on my laptop since it was purchased in 2010 and it has been amazing. I have told all of my old friends and i'm telling my new friends about how great it is.
531	0	This product did what I needed.  I am as frustrated with everyone else's comments on the product changing and followed the backlash closely.  I however did not need to file a schedule C and/or E.  I contacted HR Block and they provided a copy of their software, I prepared the taxes with both and was more pleased with the flow of TurboTax and filed using this software.  In future years I will stay with TurboTax as I like the software more than competitors.
532	-1	Using Quicken Deluxe for years, however, the FORCED UPDATE is an issue I will no longer tolerate - So long Quicken!
533	-1	This product makes big claims but fails to catch and delete malware. I had 3 pc's that had Norton 360 on them and all 3 were infected with malware that Norton 360 could have cared less was on my computers. It never found them when doing a system scan or when downloading and installing questionable programs. Norton 360 would scan the download and say that it was safe. There are better choices for protection out there . Norton 360 claims it is the only protection you need. Don't believe it. Choose Trend Micro and Malware Bytes and for extra protection you could try Hitman Pro.
534	0	Not intuitive!
535	0	ordered deluxe==ended up paying for premier--I'm not very happy--talk about bait and switch!  but it did do the job
536	-1	They removed the ability to import QIF files and instead only have the option to download their own custom version of OXF called QXF. However, if your bank isn't on their 'approved list' there is no way to automatically get the transactions into Quicken without manually typing them. Their support helpfully tell you to switch to another bank.<br /><br />Fortunately, Intuit provides a 60 day money back guarantee.
537	0	Great start - loved the setup, but could not find many of the little things I need - It is a good start
538	0	Like the software, don't like the price or the fact I just got version 6 and one week later 7 came out.
539	1	I've used TurboTax for years and the downloaded version worked just like a CD version, but now I don't have to store the CD somewhere and hope I can find it later if needed.
540	0	Having been trained and doing budgets for years, the primary purpose of a budget is to forecast cash flow. Or as Dave Ramsey says, to look through the windshield to see where you are going and not in the rear view mirror to see where you have been. Version 2011 did it, although some awkward. We all agree that 2012 was awful and 2013 only show what has happened in the past.<br /><br />Forecasting cash flow by knowing the inflows and out flows by month allows common sense planning that gives peace of mind and less the cost of bounced check charges and panic. That is 90% of the value. The other 10% is knowing how well you are doing in following the plan. Reactive people will never do a budget, so provide software for people that are proactive which will. So triple work with Excel spreadsheet it is again for another year. Accurate planning for future and investing, etc.<br /><br />The new loan setup may be great as I have not had chance to use it. However, not being able to look back at the transactions of a loan that is paid off, except by printing out the register, is a concern. Having said all of this and as a user since DOS version 2, Quicken continues to be the best available at this time. Just would greatly prefer an updating of version 2011. Premier users have different needs and expectations than Starter users and the online version users.<br /><br />Jim<br /><br />Update: Just setup a new home loan. The previous wizard was intuitive and worked great. The new one makes no mention of escrow and is not intuitive. Sure would like to be able to go back to 2011!!
541	0	Some of the features that worked well in previous versions are not working in this version. Etc envelope printing from adders book calendar is not a quick option now. I do like the mobile sync with mobile app.
542	0	This year was a cluster!
543	0	Past 15 years or so, I used TurboTax on Mac. This year, after the stupidity of Quicken to squeeze out last possible penny from people's pocket, I switched over to H&R Block. It is not as nice as TurboTax.<br />I was using this for a while, getting used to the software. During that, I took a Federal update.<br />That totally screwed up the return. That never happened with TurboTax.<br />I ended up starting from scratch. Since I went through most of it already with the papers already organized, re-entering numbers was tedious but not that bad.<br />In the end, I filed the taxes.<br />The interface is not as clear or concise as TurboTax.<br />Little things like, when you go to a page, the keyboard input automatically goes to the first input field, is missing from this software. TurboTax does this kind of things well. The result is, you have to go back to mouse and click the field before typing.<br />Also, when you change a number in any field, TurboTax updates the return immediately - this tell me the impact of number I just entered, and if something is wrong, or meaningless, it teaches me what matters.<br />This kind of details matters when you use the software only once in a year. H&R Block lacks, and it's essentially a web application.<br />They need to bring in a real human interaction designer for the product to make it better and compete better with TurboTax.  (I write software for living.)
544	1	Great product
545	-1	This product won't validate and won't install on my computer.  The free 30-day trial from Symantec worked just fine (I went on the Symantec website).  I wasted $20 and I doubt I will ever buy downloadable software through Amazon again as they do not accept returns on such items.  It's a pity.
546	1	It did what says it would do.
547	0	This was great software, that I first felt was a wonderful buy. I was able to save all the text from my phone with ease, and you could save it as a off if you wanted too- I loved that feature. The software deserves a 5 STAR rating- the ONLY reason for the minus 2 stars- is because after 3 months of buying the software I got a alert that I needed to update it (software I just had purchased now only works as a trial version which doesn't allow you to save anything). I had to fully purchase the entire software again (note: I hadn't updated my iPhone or anything)- because I loved the software- I reluctantly purchased it again. A few months after that- I again got an alert that Decipher needed to be update (fully purchased again)- I had just done so a few months earlier- what gives)- again to note I did not update my iPhone to the new OS software so realistically there should be no need to have to continually update this software. By this time, I decided not too. I understand the need to update software and pay for it but this seems a little extreme like every few months you have to pay for the whole software again and again, they don't even ofer a discount to those who have already purchased the software. It's great software- just shady that one needs to keep paying for it over and over again.
548	1	I have used this for a couple of years now and I am completely satisfied with its performance and its user friendly quality.
549	1	Great product. Gets the job done right. There are guidelines for those with no experience, so with a little knowledge you will not be completely lost.
550	1	All your finances in one place wherever you go.
551	0	Lots of download issues with certain accounts. So I have to manually enter transactions. I feel like the older versions (2010 maybe?) were less buggy and worked better. Download issues aside, this software is great for tracking expenses and running reports.
552	0	I was using Quicken 2010 Premier which was reaching the end of its' useful life.  I no longer needed all that capability so I purchased 2012 Deluxe.  It transferred the data and the first time I opened 2013 it came up showing all the transactions going back to 2010 when I purchased the Premier version as overdue.  I was not about to reenter three years worth of transactions.  I then loaded a backup I had done about two weeks prior to the upgrade and it reflected the correct status as of that  date.  I thenonly had to enter the two missing weeks of data.  Since that I have had no problems with the product.
553	-1	I did not like TT jacking up the price, and leaving out the critical investment forms and NOT TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT THAT BEFORE THEY STARTED THEIR RETURNS. Even worse was the BS letter that the CEO sent out saying 'we hear you' and we will give you money off (our usually sky high prices!) so we can try and keep you.  I am getting the H&R Block tax preparation software.  I simply will not give my money to businesses who demonstrate a lack of concern for their customers, who feel that customers are fools to be fleeced, and who conceal their intent to squeeze their customer base for every dollar they can.  My advice, check out the great prices on H&R Block software.  It will get your info from your last year's return, no problem.  I hope TT goes out of business.  We don't need companies like this one.
554	0	I designed my own record keeping through Excel and was thinking that this program could replace my attempt at tracking my money better.  I was a bit dissapointed that it doesn't seem to import my banking information too easily.  This partly because banking software is becoming more encrypted which is a good thing but bad for these financial programs.  I will still use it off and on but I thought I would get more use out of it.
555	-1	I want my money back this isnt easy to use at all. So how do I get my money back
556	1	This program helps us see where we are in our finances. It is our goal to be debt free and this is a huge help.
557	1	I love this software. I use almost everyday for digital scrapbooking. It has a lot of wonderful features. It's easy to use.
558	1	I've used this product for years and it keeps getting better.  My taxes are complicated but I am able to complete both Federal and State forms (and electronically file them) in 30 minutes, thanks to this product.
559	-1	I have used quicken on my PC for many years and quickly upgraded once I saw they had an app. But the app is really quite useless. The balances are never correct or match the PC version. Sync is finicky and you can't use the app offline. Can't view bills or budgets in it and the overall layout isn't easy to look through if you have lots of transactions each month. Even if they can't fix the app it would be nice to have an online version you can view for whenever you're away from your desktop.
560	0	Overall the program is tolerable. The problem I had was that one of my IRAs gave me a double distribution which I rolled over and I could not find any way to list it correctly on my return. I'm sure I will have to explain it to the IRS because there is a 1099R showing it as income. After waiting over 30 minutes for CSR help that didn't come, I dummied-up the return to reflect the correct numbers.
561	0	Obviously there is a need to update software as microprocessor design & speed improve, but, as usual with Microsoft,  all the efficient, useful, parts get thrown out and replaced with an apparently randomized set of interface &#34;improvements&#34; for a trendy new look.  What used to take one, or maybe two, clicks now takes three or four, assuming that it's doable at all.<br />I loath the &#34;ribbon&#34; and long for the original drop-down menu. I hate silly little icons. If MS wants to be international, then they should provide a &#34;set language&#34; selector.
562	-1	You have to added another part of Kaspersky to get complete success with this anti-virus program. Meaning that there our addition cost to get full protection of Kaspesky Anti-Virus 2014.
563	0	I expected more.  The ap for my Ipad doesn't  let me do anything exept see balances.  I really thought that I would be able to pay bills etc.
564	1	Really good
565	1	Great software works as expected. I like that I can download straight from Amazon.
566	-1	You know, every year I say the same thing. I'll never use TurboTax again! Then, I remember they have all my information and can easily port over last year's returns to save some time. Ugh. I've had major issues with this program every year I've used it. From their marginally competent at best support, to their deceptive marketing practices (oh, use the program free! but pay a ton for the file, or, pay for the program and the state is free...but not the e-file, just the right to use the state portion of the program!), or the fact that it doesn't find errors until the very, very, very last step even though it has told me it has reviewed everything prior to that.<br /><br />At least now I'm smart enough to know I'll probably use this crap next year too.
567	0	I just converted from 30 years on Microsoft  products on PC's to an Apple.  The switch to the Apple hasn't been drama free but it has been interesting to see how computing can be imagined by different brainiacs.  This version of Office for Mac's however hasn't been very satisfying.  It's a diminished version of the real thing with some old shortcuts and abilities left out.  It seems to be about 80% of the real Office so be prepared for some gaps.  They start with the presentation on the screen and go on from there.  At the same time it's a comfort to know that most of Office is available as I become acquainted with Apple's software.
568	1	I used this product every year. You can't go wrong with this product.
569	-1	Thinking that no one whould notice in this booming economy, Intuit has decided to stealthly change the terms of the license agreement to grab as much money as they can. What next? A per minute fee you must pay to use software which you already purchased in addition to the $10 per return?  Do yourself a favor and just use another product from someone less slimy.
570	-1	I bought this because there is a unresolved problem with MS DVD Maker.  I was hoping this would be an upgrade from the free DVD Maker that comes with Windows 7.  PowerDirector is powerful, but they only include a couple of menu templates, and you cannot customize them as you can in DVD Maker.  They expect you to download free templates that users make, but most of them are not very good, unless you like anime characters.  There are thousands, but I have gone through about 1000 already, and cannot find a simple, classy menu that I need.  Since they are user-made, they are not really professional looking, and I don't have the skill or time to make my own.  You can purchase packs from Cyberlink, but I don't want to spend the additional cost for something I would think should already be included with the purchased software.  I think I am returning this as it really doesn't suit my needs for a simple, complete DVD making software.  EDIT1:  I just tried burning a DVD and after 1.5 hours of converting, I got some kind of burn error.  Going to try one more time and then I give up. EDIT2:  I was able to create a disc image, then burned my DVDs from that.  I am undecided on keeping this or returning it.  I don't need most of the features on this application.
571	0	"fresher look is nice, but there are features missing (it appears) that I liked but do not seem to be included in the new version:<br />*ability to create customized \\""quick fill\\"" window with my transactions where I can click to enter as a new transaction with all fields filled in<br />*ability to shrink the register window without losing visibility on columns<br />*transfer between accounts seems to be more complicated and less intuitive compared to Quicken2007<br />*ability to set up automatic file back-ups to a designated folder location is either missing or I just can't find it.  It appears back files need to be created manually each time.<br /><br />Like all things new I am sure some issues are due to my lack of familiarity with the new version after using just 1 month.  However, some things just seem to be dropped from older version.  As with most applications, the user doesn't have much choice when support for the old versions is no longer available so we're forced to upgrade for better or worse, and there's usually some of both in my experience."
572	1	Like most people, I really DREAD tax time!  However, it has to be done and done correctly.  For me, it has to be done correctly AND quickly.  I turned to the H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe + State to file my 2013 taxes when my tax preparer retired.  I was truly impressed and so I turned to it again for the 2014 tax year.  Again, especially with the new laws concerning health care taxes, I am impressed!  I took me all of 1 HOUR to start, complete and e-file BOTH my federal and state tax returns!  Thank you H&R Block!!!
573	1	I like it and my son loved it.
574	0	"I had been happily using Quicken 2010, and had no interest in upgrading, but I received a notification that as of April 2013, Quicken 2010 would no longer support downloading data from financial institutions.  I hate being forced to spend money upgrading to new versions of software when the version I was using had been working just fine, and had all the features I needed.  I have no interest in uploading my financial data to the \\""cloud\\"" in order to access it on mobile devices, so I had no compelling reason to upgrade other than Quicken's artificial expiration date.<br /><br />That said, Quicken 2013 works as well for me as version 2010 did.  When it expires in 2016, I'll probably upgrade again."
575	1	Worked out great!!!
576	1	Does the job. Could not merge older Quicken files into it though.
577	-1	I have Quicken Deluxe 2013 & I could track paychecks with more information when adding it to the checking register. I think poped up a few time but, not when I click on up coming reminders.
578	0	First of all the down load and installation was very difficult to achieve. I have a very fast router and very fast computer. After 5 days I was able to get the password and open and run the application. I tell you it really takes a lot to get used to. I really miss the old Adobe 9 which did not have cloud prompts. Scanning and converting was so simple for this simple minded person. That is progress.
579	0	The product has a ton of features. So many that it is a bit hard to use. Simeone that wants to be a bit more professional will love this but i was hoping fir ut to be simpler. Only real complaint is that if you down load it takes a long time
580	-1	Total ripoff, should be shareware/freeware. I googled Mac Blu-ray player for my Pioneer BD burner to play back movies and some Macworld review got me to buy this digital download. It's completely unstable, sometimes it works, sometimes it crashes 10 times just booting up the disc menu. If you switch on subtitles for a foreign language film, it randomly disappears and forces you to re-check the subtitles selection again and again and again forcing you to go back to english language. Certain films lag and drop frames, just garbage. I feel insulted that Macworld recommended with piece of crap, it's not worth $40 it's worth about $0.10 if anything.  I've asked for a refund 3 times now and they keep giving me the run around, telling me to verify with crash log reports, I've checked my console and crash log and aiseesoft doesn't even show up in my log after I've had to force quit it 10 times in a row because it won't even load the original King Kong Blu-ray disc, I tried the trial version of MacGo and it loads and plays, but not in this piece of garbage player. I hate this software and hate these crooks.  They keep sending me a diagnostic app link that leads to a dead page with a search engine and a picture of a rock band in the background, they are crooks. They want me to run a crash log with some imaginary software.  ... these blu ray players are such a rip off, I got the classic silent film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this damn player with play the video, yet offers no optional english subtitles, or AUDIO!!! when you got to subtitles option it's just blank and there is no audio option. Then I tried the demo version of MacGo BD player, it plays the audio and offers subtitles BUT the video is completely GARBLED like a cubist painting... RIP OFF TRASH. And I was just about to finally buy the full Mac Go application, F' that... I'm done. I guess I'll just have to buy a region free BD player finally. F' this wasting money on con artists.
581	-1	Will not work with Wells Fargo accounts using express connect.<br /><br />Just go to Wells Fargo and search their forums.<br />I personally spent 6+ hours with quicken support trying to resolve the issue.<br />Then I went to the Wells Fargo site and discovered other users having the Same issue.<br />The problem is that you can initially set up your Wells Fargo accounts, but then they will not download without deactivating them and then deactivating them.<br />This issue has been going on for well over a year.<br /><br />My other checking / credit card accounts outside of the quicken/wells loop works fine.<br />So, probably a good package as long as you don't bank with Wells Fargo.<br />A negative 1 if you do.<br />Would be hard to justify giving the software away, much less charging money for it.
582	0	it's turbo tax online ... nuff said
583	0	Buyer beware... Turbo Tax charges an extra $30 if you have investment data to enter. Previously investment option was free now they charge. Next they will charge to enter deductions. I will be looking for another product next year.
584	0	I was very hesitant to make this upgrade from 2010, after reading the long list of negative reviews, but so far I'm okay with this purchase. I have been a Quicken user since the 1990s. This version looks and feels and works like Quicken always has, and I've always been basically happy with the software. I had no problems with upgrading or initial synchronization, unlike some other customers have noted. Aside from seeing some differences between versions, it was a transparent, fast and painless upgrade process.<br /><br />I give this program 3 instead of 5 stars solely because of the three-year expiration in online services. New customers really need to understand this before they get involved with Quicken. Financial software is something of a long-term relationship, and this becomes a significant cost factor in making your selection. I depend on the online features for tracking a large number of bank balances and online services. I understand WHY they require the periodic refresh (online service formats change over time) but it's still highly frustrating to be FORCED to upgrade. Changing versions is annoying at best, and difficult at worst, and it comes with a real monetary cost. If they wanted to, Intuit COULD design Quicken so that those features alone could be updated separately. Obviously, forcing a comprehensive upgrade (without offering a true upgrade price) is part of their business model, and they deserve to be dinged for that alone. Fortunately, the excellent Amazon price (&#62;60% off the Intuit asking price) makes it easier to swallow this year.<br /><br />Some changes I noticed right away, compared to Q2010:<br />- The online tools have fixed some visual refresh issues when the post-update summary was shown. Nice.<br />- The synchronization/download process is MUCH faster now. Nice.<br />- The cleared/reconciled marker now shows a popup selection tool. Takes LONGER to change multiple items. Not nice.<br />- Some minor interface look-and-feel differences.Meh.<br />- The software self-updated upon initial installation. Nice.<br />- My Q2010 files were quickly loaded and updated (yes, I backed them up before trusting this new version). Nice.<br />- Register transactions have a handy set of action buttons at the right. Nice.<br />- I spotted a few new options that will allow me to prevent certain things that really bugged me in Q2010, like certain autofill and autocorrect actions. Nice.<br /><br />I refuse to touch the mobile tools; first, there are still too many negative reviews, and second, I am unwilling to upload sensitive financial information and account numbers into the cloud. I'd never recommend it to my friends, on sheer principle. What is so urgent that you cannot wait to do it until you get home to your desktop? So I cannot comment on the mobile features.<br /><br />All in all, I'm satisfied.
585	1	Love it!
586	1	I have used Norton products for over 15 years and have never been disappointed in their performance.  Norton Internet Security has saved my computer many times with warnings about websites.  It is the best!
587	1	I've never used anything else so I have no comparison.  The first time I used it, it was a little bit confusing but over the years I've adapted.  It's definitely better than the old fashioned way of filling out the forms and mailing them in.  E-file is the way to go!!
588	1	I'm a pretty consistent electronic filer with Turbo Tax.  I don't have a lot of complex filing concerns.  Each time I've used Turbo Tax, it's done a great job of loading my previous years data and reducing the amount of effort I have to put in as a home owner.  The process was simple, smooth and worked perfectly.  Unless something drastic occurs, I plan to use it again next year.
589	-1	Junk.  I bought this after reading all the horrible reviews on turbotax since they updated the program and now require you to buy the more expensive version so I thought I would give HR block a try.  It claims you can upload your old data from turbotax but it doesn't.  Every time I try to upload my previous year's data it gives an win exception error and just shuts down.  Not impressed so far.  I guess the saying you get what you pay for is sometimes right on.
590	-1	Have used Adobe products since PS4 (pre CS) but ended all with CS6 versions, sorry just like to own my software not rent it. Best of luck Adobe with software rental business
591	1	NO comments, There is no compare with other products worldwide.<br />Easy to install and easy to use.<br />Thank you very much
592	0	I did some sub-contracting work this season....the automated guide was confusing at best due to the limited category descriptions.  I ended up going old school and working directly on the tax forms.<br /><br />Over all still a good product provided you don't own a business.
593	0	It is a good program tends to freeze, and run slow at times.  No instructions it is a learn as you good type of thing.  And the spoken Danish sometimes is spoken too fast and hard to understand.
594	0	I've been a Quicken customer for years and years.  I usually upgrade every other edition as I'm not a hard core user (tacking my accounts online as I input everything manually).  I went from Quicken 2011 to 2013 thinking that Quicken would finally (after years of asking) be able to sync my Charles Schwab 401(k) account automatically.  Nope, still the same problems as every other version.  I'd understand if I was trying to sync some 3rd party account to Quicken, but we're talking Charles Schwab!  So because I enter everything in manually (never trust the auto update function as it goofs up every now and then and it's a disaster to recover) I have no need for any further upgrades, ever.  This is what happens when one company has a monopoly on a product.  No competition equates to resting on your laurels.  Quicken has lost my business for good.
595	-1	I've always had some issues with the software, but have been used to the format, so I've continued to buy it. In 2012 I used the ONLINE VERSION, and my advice is to NEVER, EVER do it.  It failed to import some important depreciation numbers from 2011 H&R Block software sitting in my computer even when I asked it to. Because of this failure, I now need to file an amended return. It should not be complicated. I only need to write in four carryover depreciation numbers and a capital loss carryover- FIVE NUMBERS. Alas,  I no longer have access to my 2012 software in order to write these in (because it was an online account) and get an automatic recalculation.  After calling customer service twice, I've gotten the same answer, and I'm fuming.  THERE IS NO WAY TO FILE AN AMENDED RETURN FROM PREVIOUS YEARS IF YOU HAVE AN ONLINE ACCOUNT, using your old software entries. I have freshly downloaded 2012 software and now must completely restart and complete the return in order to see the recalculations for the amended return.  This is a terrible flaw in a system set up by a company that only deals in taxes.  I wouldn't have had the problem in the first place if the online account had successfully imported the previous years stuff.  This is beyond frustrating.I'm sure I'm not the only person that has needed to file an amended return but can't access my old software entries.
596	0	So far I've only had this product for a week, but it seems to be a worthy improvement to Quickens Essentials for Mac.  I read all the reviews here and was worried that it wouldn't be worth the money, and I don't want to support a company that so clearly doesn't care about what the vocal Mac users want from Quicken.  My review is from this frame - I already had Essentials, I've used Quicken on a mac since the 90s, and I've also tried iBank.  If I weren't of a certain age that my mind has locked into the quicken way, I think iBank would have been fine.  For me, the cost of mental change between systems was too high.  2015 is a bit of an improvement from Essentials and functions well for my basic balancing needs.  I like the improvements to the investment features, and had a very smooth data transition from Essentials to 2015.  I don't use the bill pay function, which seems to be a major sticking point for others.<br /><br />So while in principle I want to move away from Intuit and Quicken, its not worth my time and effort.  This new version seems to be OK and functional.
597	1	Love it
598	1	Very easy to use walks you through everything
599	-1	Horrible!
600	0	Protecting your computer from malicious software is a necessary evil in todays world. I don't know anyone who is thrilled with spending their hard earned money on a product that takes an incredible amount of system resources to run, but hey this is the 21st century. To me anyway buying this type of product is like purchasing insurance from a protection racket. I pay a modest sum to one individual so that I don't have to pay a greater sum to another. All I can say is I am thankful that I could purchase this product for a reasonable price on Amazon. McAfee sent me a renewal fee &#34;reminder&#34; that would have cost me nearly 300 percent more of my hard earned dollars.<br /><br />I kind of feel like I'm caught between a rock and a firewall, so to speak.
601	-1	This version no longer handles rental property. Forced to purchase more expensive version.
602	1	I haven't used Quicken before. I used to use Microsoft Money. I find this Quicken software to be fabulous because it is easy to install, easy to learn how to use, very functional, has excellent graphics, and flawlessly connects to my bank accounts updating everything.<br /><br />Even though Chase has a feature that will show you expenditures by category, you can't rename the categories, which is easy to do with Quicken. I also like that I can keep the history for as long as I want, which enables me to look back at when we bought certain items for our house.<br /><br />The budgeting is just about as easy as it could be and I don't understand some of the criticisms about it. It's great.<br /><br />All in all, I'm now a Quicken customer.
603	0	Way too complicated for those who have a simple tax return to process.<br /><br />In addition to my relatively simple return I had a $20 1099 misc for natural gas royalties. It took me 2 hours to navigate the 1099 section to find an appropriate section to place this very minor addition.
604	-1	Contrary to the Intuit posts, it's Amazon listing  for this product states as follows:<br /><br />•60 day money-back guarantee<br />•Easily imports your data from earlier versions of Quicken<br /><br />it may &#34;import&#34; such data, but it will not convert to  anything  that is usable!
605	0	Having been a Quicken for PC user for many years prior to converting to primarily a Apple Mac user, I was somewhat disappointed with the long awaited upgrade to Quicken Essentials for Mac. I expected the upgrade to be similar to the upgrades I had been used to with Quicken for PCs in that I would end up with one Quicken application instead of 2. For now I'm maintaining both old and new Quickens until I feel I can fully trust and learn to use the newer Quicken for Macs before I abandon the older version as a fallback in case I have problems with the newest version of Quicken. Hopefully my apprehensions are unfounded and all will be fine in the end. Only time will tell.
606	-1	My 83 year old father paid good money for this piece of COMPLETE GARBAGE. Now:<br /><br />- His PC hangs on power-up showing the GrimeFighter splash screen.<br />- There appears to be no way to uninstall it! Uninstalling the GrimeFighter component of Avast doesn't work and neither does uninstalling Avast in its entirety. Pressing F12 during the boot cycle seems to show that it has made its own unbypassable boot sector.<br />- The lengthy instructions supplied as a result of raising a support ticket with them don't work either.<br />- Their latest response is &#34;The best advice I can offer you would be take the PC to a computer repair shop. Or, you may also try reinstalling or repairing the Windows using the installation disk if that is possible.&#34; UNBELIEVABLE!<br /><br />(Sorry about the SHOUTING but they've really got my goat up!)
607	0	Didn't like the interface.
608	-1	After enduring Intuit's constant offers to upgrade during my many, many, years of using Deluxe, this latest move to squeeze the customer pushed me out the door; I just ordered H&R Block's software, which isn't shackled the way TT is. So long, Intuit!
609	0	Quicken 2013 is a good program to manage your finances, but the upgrade from 2012 did not bring much.  It was more of a one feature update than an upgrade, and was too expensive even for an upgrade.  The only real difference I have noticed is being able to sync to an app on my iPad.  It is a nice feature, but not worth the cost of the upgrade.  It should have been a $9.99 app.  If you have 2012, I wouldn't bother with the upgrade.
610	1	If you need to touch up any photos this would be THE program to use. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that works digitally.
611	-1	Not what I'm looking for in an invoicing software. I didn't evening install the program on my desk top. If you are looking for a three month subscription online. Its a good program. I needed a program that I am able to use offline.
612	-1	This is really a review of Amazon's software download process and not Turbotax. Amazon fails to provide any notice on Turbotax's product page that to download and install it you'll have to first download and install Amazon's download manager. That requirement was not revealed until after the purchase was made and I was looking to download Turbotax. I refuse to use Amazon's download manager and called and had the order canceled.    So beware if you don't like using third party download managers.
613	1	This product got my nephew and another second grade girl I tutor reading! Their scores in reading and spelling went way up!!!
614	-1	"I don't see much new this year, nor have I seen any thing that justified the cost of renewing in the past 10 or so years.  Except for \\""cloud\\"" and mobile support, but I would not put my financial data out for the world to share anyway.  I keep all financials on one computer that is not used for anything else and disconnect from the internet when I don't need the connection."
615	0	Maybe my expectations were high.  But I would expect a $70 product to provide efiling for state as well, as opposed to just the current federal efile.
616	0	Like it very much on my first computer! But dont try installing it on the second or third.  Doesnt work and it will take you forever to uninstall it.
617	0	"I have been using quicken since I bought my first computer back in 1993 and it came with a trial version.<br />I think it is crappy that they would make it to where you cannot perform downloads of your accounts anymore unless you upgrade.<br />I can understand not supporting the older versions but to make it useless is absurd. Also, I think that an \\""upgrade\\"" should not cost as much as buying the software as if you were a first time user, once you're a user you should get a reduced price (not just $10 off)which everyone can get.I think I will research some alternatives."
618	-1	I'm betting H&R Block is absolutely loving this. I'd give ZERO starts if I could. I too have been a TurboTax customer for over 20 years, and am fully disgusted by their bait and switch attitude plus greed in forcing people to move up to the Premier level for 3 lousy forms that used to be in the Deluxe version for years. TaxCut will be my choice this year, and I doubt I'll ever come back to TT. Good marketing strategy TT. Your going out of the tax preparation business next year should let us know just how well this strategy worked for you. What MBA there didn't foresee this avalanche of negative publicity coming?
619	0	It is true that if you want to delete this from your machine, it takes some doing (and googling). I have it on my desktop but not on my laptop: I replaced hard drives and couldn't get it authorized again. Oh well. Also, even though it tells you (in the software) that you can get a free upgrade to CleanMyMac2, you can't.
620	0	Easy to download and do the taxes, HOWEVER, hours and hours on the phone with tech support to get the updates.  UGH.
621	-1	"I purchased this to renew an existing account. The existing subscription had 34 days left on it. In the area where it was asking for the new code, it said \\""Your remaining 34 days will be added to the new renewal\\"". It was not. When the new license number was entered, it showed 366 days rather than the 399 days that I should have had. After a 20 minute chat session with Norton, they did extend the subscription, but I wonder how many people never notice that despite what the instructions say, any remaining time on your current subscription is not included in the new one - it just resets the clock to 366 days."
622	-1	This software doesn't work. Requires you to create a bootable DVD and boot from it. Worked with their support people for hours trying to get it to work. Tried using bootable USB. Booted from DVD and USB drives, but software wouldn't run and caused the MacBook to reboot immediately. After many hours working with their support team, never got it working. To top it all off, they refused to give me a refund saying it was a lifetime license and I could use it in the future. If it doesn't work, how am I going to use it. Note that I purchase directly from the manufacturer and not through Amazon.
623	-1	For example, the &#34;Rules&#34; feature for filtering incomming mail is clumsy to use and does not always work.  I have multiple entries for the same sender and still some get through.
624	0	Good not great I have still had unexplained problems that got by it.  I guest there is not infallible internet security.
625	1	I've never had the inclination to do my own taxes before but due to the continuous escalation in tax preparing prices I decided to give it a try, especially since Turbo Tax walked me through every step and offered other help if needed. The additional prices that were needed are still cheaper than HR Block or other tax preparers. I haven't received my refund yet because it's still too early but Turbo Tax assured me I had no errors and guaranteed acceptance. Overall the process of using this software was easy, seamless, quite helpful and saved me money.
626	0	"Summary: Don't bother! But if you must, get the full version not the download: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KINCSW?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8<br /><br />I and my wife are \\""do it yourself\\"" types who run two small businesses with only 2 employees (ourselves). We just want a simple but functional accounting package where we can handle everything ourselves without the need to blow all the money that does come in on subscriptions to accounting services. We pay good money for QuickBooks already. Isn't that enough? On that note, I have to start off with the negative points, and try to wrap up with something positive along with a few notes about why you shouldn't bother with the downloadable version.<br /><br />===== The Bad =====<br /><br />It will be Intuit's downfall for consistently and annoyingly upselling, cross-marketing, and advertising subscription services throughout their applications. The worst area for me is within Quickbooks Payroll.<br /><br />As a very small company with only 2 employees, it does not make any sense to subscribe to any QB Payroll services. That being said, it is possible to work around the ads but QB does make you work. #1, QB does not save your paycheck details (as in memorized paychecks). Each time we run payroll, I have to manually enter in all the data for withholding even though it is the same each time. #2, When I need help with anything in Payroll, the steps detailed in the Help (not the online help) are not valid. Yes, that's right. The menu options they suggest are not available to me since I am not a subscriber. So I have to waste time trying to click around and find what I need. #3, The withholding info isn't available to me unless I also have Microsoft Office and Excel. It does not work with Open Office. So I had to again find a work around when it came time to file my two W-2s. These are just the complaints foremost in my mind. There are other examples where Intuit is practically forcing you to pay them more money via subscription services just so their program works the way it should.<br /><br />===== The Ugly =====<br /><br />It is very time consuming to customize invoices, receipts, and other memos. Once you have a finished template for an invoice, you cannot port that design over to a receipt even if you want them to look exactly the same; there is a very low usability when it comes to reminders. Let's say you want to send an outstanding invoice again 2 weeks and/or 1 week before it is due. You can write yourself a note or create a memo, and if you have the Company Snapshot open, you might see that reminder's title. You then have to click on the reminder to see what it says. Then you have to go to the client, click on the invoice, then select e-mail invoice. Close all those open windows. Then select Send Forms, edit the email text to say it's just a reminder and the invoice is a copy only, then hit send. It would be far more intuitive to have a function built into the program to auto select certain invoices for reminders and select when to send the reminder. More: Memorized bills have to be paid through the Pay Bills window, rather than the simpler register, or you will screw up your bill payments. Memorized bills will never enter themselves in the register even if you have a bill in real life that automatically debits your account every month. So even though the biller really automatically debits your account, QB makes you \\""pay\\"" the bill manually for your records every time. Again, not intuitive.<br /><br />===== The Good =====<br /><br />Things we do like about QuickBooks: Once your invoice template is made, sending invoices is very simple. Keeping track of outstanding invoices, bills, and other expenses is also simple. The program itself is pretty straightforward once you get used to it. Creating reports is also a matter of clicking around and in a minute or so you have your report. Doing the taxes also becomes a simple matter of porting the data into your tax software. That's whereQB shines and proves its worth. Of course, each tax category has to be double checked manually. This year our rent was entered in the taxes as 10 times less than what it should have been. I still don't know what caused the glitch. Luckily I checked it and was able to manually override the mistake.<br /><br />===== Why Not the Downloadable Version? =====<br /><br />This year we decided to try the downloadable version, but it wasn't a simple download. You had to download a \\""downloader\\"" and then use that to download your software. You're then asked what PC you want to use the software on. Long story short: Get the real thing (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KINCSW?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8) and just be patient especially if you hate installing crap on your PC just to handle a simple task, especially downloading software, and if you want to avoid the burdens imposed by Digital Rights Management (DRM).<br /><br />I downloaded the software on a different computer than I intended to use the software on. While in the end, I got the download, it didn't go to my ideal location, and I had to hunt around a bit to find it in EXE format.<br /><br />Just say no to bloatware! Are the few bucks you save worth the extra nonsense?ategory has to be double checked manually. This year our rent was entered in the taxes as 10 times less than what it should have been.

627	-1	Wow, I've been a loyal TT user for many years as I have multiple properties. I was researching which TT to buy this year and discovered that both Deluxe and Home business may not meet my needs due to the forms that TT no longer includes and the expense limits and override ability.  Glad I read the reviews.  I've been considering trying a different tax prep software for a few years now since TT is in my opinion NOT the easiest software to use, but I put it off because of the hassle of  re-entering all the data that TT automatically transfers year-to-year. But frankly TT just made that hassle worth the effort.  Not to mention that H&R Deluxe is $40 versus $94.  And give me a break, TT has been advertising a &#34;limited time&#34; offer of up to $15 off every week for the last month, but you look at the various retailers and I don't see any special values.  Done with TT
628	1	The Mobile app. is a nice feature that if am learning to use to it's fullest.  I have used the Deluxe Edition of Quicken for many, many years and it has kept me on track with my finances very well. I would highly recommend this program for anyone wanting to organize their finances.
629	1	For those who use Office at work, this is a great product for your home Mac book. Saves a lot of time of learning a new product. There are some differences between the Office for PC vs Mac, but it's still a heck of a lot better than learning an entire new software. Get it.
630	0	I would have rated your service Very Good until yesterday when I called your on line service rep.<br />Had paid $19.99 for grime cleaning.<br />The process went fine until it reported I could not get a report as there was a glitch.<br />That's when I called your rep.<br />He indicated I had to pay approx $200.00 to fix the problem and popped an invoice in front of me.<br />It felt very pushy and surprising.  I just said no.<br />I don't know where I stand right now -<br />Joanna
631	-1	WARNING ABOUT DOWNLOADS FROM AMAZON!!! You cannot cancel any order for a downloaded item. Make sure you read every word on the description. I spent 2 hours dealing with this, and now have to deal with it again with my two other laptops. Absolute Junk. Cannot download, no option to return or cancel. Hey Amazon, what happened to you?
632	0	I don't have a huge amount of deductions or credits but I do have a rental room so I needed the Premier edition.<br />While the step-by-step makes doing your taxes easy, it still seems to lack intuitiveness for the odd-ball situation.<br />While the Federal E-File is free, you still have to pay for the state e-file.<br />In my case, the charges would have been more than I was getting back; the state went hardcopy via snail-mail.<br />If I couldn't deduct the cost of the software as a tax preparation expense, I don't know if I would get it.<br /><br />For the person who doesn't know the difference between a 1099 and a 1040, it's a must have.

634	0	To start off with, one reason my review is 3 stars is I am not using another foreign language pack with this product, and that may make it more than a 3 star product if I were. While I speak German and Spanish as well as English it just was not in my needs to have them for a thesaurus (don't write in them really).<br /><br />I get better results (but sometimes different) from the free Dictionary(dot)com thesaurus than I do from this product.  While this product has provided me synonyms and antonyms the free online thesaurus has not, it also has not provided as many options.<br /><br />I am not a linguist and do not know if that means that Dictionary(dot)com's thesaurus is just reaching at straws, and these are more solid synonyms, but I do appreciate the ability to use it offline and my hope is with some updates it can get better.<br /><br />The price was high, but it's way better than what comes with the cheaper products here on Amazon (such as Britannica's built in thesaurus) and others.  This thesaurus also does not have certain words in its dictionary, and it's dictionary needs some work.<br /><br />The interface is wonderful, and it's a great idea.  For the money they charge though (More than Webster or Oxford) they need to do more than provide better software with limited data. I will continue to monitor updates for this, and update this review if updates help solve the problem.<br /><br />I was looking to have something offline as good as Dictionary(com)'s thesaurus, and even dictionary (while not as important).  I did not get that for a high price, I did get a fast, easy download though, and I -WOULD- buy this again, because I am big on having my own tools and not relying on the web for things if I can avoid it.<br /><br />They do need to update the power of the dictionary and thesaurus in this, but I noticed that if you speak more than one language (like I do) it allows you to install other languages and enhance the product that way.  Kudos for that, and Kudos for the great interface.  Jeers for the poor database of words.<br /><br />A better database moves this to a 4 or 5 star product, even at its premium (when compared to other dictionaries) price.  I consider it better than the built in Dictionary in Encyclopedia Britannica and would as I said before, buy this again, because it has worked out in many cases.  I just get annoyed some words are not even thesaurus compatible, but may have a dictionary definition.  Evolving product, let's keep an eye on them.<br /><br />Looks like it CAN be the best, but will it be is the question right now.  I will be back (promise) as updates may change the rating, and hence the review.<br /><br />Still worthwhile purchase for me.f words.

635	1	Great product for any pc or windows tablet
636	0	I have generally liked Quicken and have used it for many years.  It has sometimes been frustrating to get just the right settings for my use.  It is sometimes not obvious how it is working when I get a new version, as is the case right now.  I trust it will get worked out, or I will figure out how to use it.
637	-1	Purchased a &#34;5 pack&#34; license key at Best Buy for MS Office 365. This is a download/cloud version only...you pay per month (or discount if you pay for a year in advance.)<br />All you get is a credit card like/sized card which proves you bought it. An email arrives from the Geek Squad (Best Buy's service) In the email is your product key code. So far OK. Then you create an account at microsoft.com. Name/address/phone/email/password/product key code, etc. So far OK. Then I got into an endless loop where MSFT wants a second email address to give you a security code (even though you've already told them the 20 digit product key code already. So I sent a web based secondary address and I get into the loop which says send in another address that has to be either &#34;hotmail.com&#34; or &#34;outlook.com. &#34; If you create a new hotmail account they will send you a security code in 48 hours. Excuse me??? 48 hours! This is one of the largest companies in the world and they can't send me a security code? And I have to sign up with hotmail. Ha!<br />48 hours later there is no email from MSFT. I called the Geek squad (4 times because each time I talk to the nice kid that answered the phone, he is of no help.)  keep trying, they transfer me to MSFT. The tech guy says he will have to transfer me to someone who will do a remote install.<br /><br />Well, this story is getting longer than it deserves. Suffice to say that After 4 calls to Geek Squad and 2 calls to MSFT (because India keeps dropping the call) and after a long inline chat with Microsoft (asking for help)......all I got was a link to the endless loop asking for my mail address so they can &#34;send me a security code.&#34;<br /><br />Hours wasted trying to get a security code and I didn't even get to download my MS Office365.<br />Drove to Best Buy, got my $$ back and took my husband out to dinner.<br /><br />I'll miss you Microsoft. Goodbye. You shouldn't be so arrogant and obstructive. For my PC I downloaded Libre Office for free! (open source.) For my Mac I will use the proprietary office software on Mavericks OS. I bet I won't miss excel and word very much.<br /><br />At my advanced age a person shouldn't spend too much time on the phone with tech support. There are other fun things to do. And heck, one of these days I may not even wake up.<br /><br />As an added one STAR vote to another company, the Geek Squad deserves a star just because the guys that answered the phone agreed with me that Microsoft sucks.d Libre Office for free!

638	1	have had avast internet security for 3 yrs and have had absolutely no spyware problems.  Great software at good price. also have three computers and avast software covers all three for the price of the software.
639	-1	I had purchased the Premier edition - did not know Schedule F was not included. Had to purchase the Home & Business edition to get Schedule F.  Even though the download was suppose to include the State tax program - it did not.  After finishing my Federal taxes - I was informed that I would have to buy the $ 39.99 State download.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years - but this will be my last.  Next year I will try H&R Block.
640	-1	I've used Quicken for more years than I can remember.  I was using Quiken  2012 which worked great, but Quicken turned off my download transaction features (they no longer wanted to support this in 2012). Told me to upgrade to 2015.  BIG MISTAKE, it's very buggy.  I'm converting back to 2012 and dealing with the lack of downloading transactions
641	-1	Ordering this version may seem simple. You buy it, the download goes directly to your software library. It should be simple, right? NO. When you order this product they DO NOT give you the serial number. Instead they give you a product key. With that product key you have to go through adobe to verify that you are in fact a student or teacher. Doesn't sound all that terrible. BUT they don't give you instructions that you have to do that. So WOW what a pain. First I contacted amazon because I didn't get a serial number. Then they told me I had to contact adobe. After dealing with multiple poor english speaking people at adobe I was finally told I had to verify I was a student. To do that they needed a scanned copy of my student ID with the date of issue and it showing it was still current. First my ID has no date of issue, second there is definitely no way of knowing that it is actually still current. Finally, after submitting my schedule, tuition bill, and a pay stub (I'm a grad student and get a stipend) from my university adobe was able to verify that yes I am a student and so I was FINALLY given the serial number. Amazon TOTALLY needs to improve the instructions for this product. Perhaps if I had been prompted at some point during the purchasing process to submit the necessary verification items I wouldn't have had to spend forever on the phone with the adobe people. I buy from amazon ALL the time. BUT WOW this was a disappointment.
642	1	Not only is Turbo Tax quick and easy to use, the puchase method of Pay and download is aslo quick and easy.
643	-1	It's a Microsoft product, what else can I say... $19 on sale, price was right, wouldn't pay the $40 for it at it's normal price though. The points of interest database is sadly out of date. We had 3 places on a recent 2 week trip where the buildings had been torn down several years ago, but were still listed in the database as being restaurants. Once it tried to get me to drive down a one-way street the wrong direction. Fortunately I caught the mistake before making the incorrect turn, which could easily have resulted in a head-on collision, or a ticket. Not impressed with this one.
644	-1	"Many people buy home tax software because it will lead you step-by-step through all the questions needed to fill out your taxes. Since I had to file income tax for two states this year I thought the software would be helpful in guiding me through all the issues associated with dual filing. While completing the step-by-step process to efile, the program failed to alert me of a condition concerning efiling my second state tax forms. This resulted in several hours of unnecessary troubleshooting with the tech support group trying to figure out how to efile my second state tax forms. I ended up finding the problem on my own, a normal function of the program requiring me to wait until my first state tax form was processed before I could submit my second state tax form. The technical support had all the evidence early in the troubleshooting session and still failed to identify the problem. They should have known the program better.<br /><br />An interesting point is I tried to post this review to the H&R Block website and was told it did not meet their guidelines for posting a review.

645	-1	Very unhappy.  I am buying Quickbooks pro now and I guess just wasted my money on the Quicken Rental property management.  If I had not bought on Amazon I could have at least returned something and got a refund.
646	-1	Was using 2011 - the new budget input interface is a cumbersome disaster and the new budget vs. actual reports are completely different from 2011 with subtotals at top of sections, among other things. Definately would not recommend.
647	0	Just OK. Can't wait for a competitor to surface.
648	0	i somehow experienced a corruption to my prime banking account.  I believe it was probably my fault from overlapping prior dates when I downloaded to Quicken.  The reason was i had trouble getting all the transactions I desired to fit my monthly report. This is the 18th year I have used every upgrade of Quicken.
649	-1	Too complicated returned, waiting for refunda
650	-1	"This review is only based on TurboTax product, not Amazon.com.  I purchased this in the hopes it would simplify the confusing filing for registered domestic partners in California.  Sadly, even after calling a couple times and live chatting several times, I was still being told conflicting information.  The \\""help\\"" (or complete lack thereof) both online and over the phone only left me more frustrated.  I have used TurboTax for several years, but now that my filing status has changed to domestic partner: I will not use this product in the future."
651	1	Easily the very best antivirus that I have ever used. It is very user-friendly and extremely noninvasive!
652	0	Hard to master you really need to use it a lot to get it down
653	0	Too many pop-ups!!
654	1	Very good, has a tendency to take over your computer and make it a little slower in response time when surfing the web
655	1	I used to have an old Quicken and used an app on my phone and a spreadsheet. With Quickern 2015 I was able to get rid of the app and the spreadsheet. I use the app from quicken and my computer and phone are now synchronized. I tried getting the free credit score but I can not get it to work with the information I added and I got frustrated. Overall I like the program.
656	0	Very sloppy design (i.e. .qfx vs .qxf fiasco).  Purchased to replace Microsoft Money for Windows 10.  Other programs did not work with Windows 10, so reverted back to Windows 7 and back to Money.  Unfortunately I did not read the fine print which does not allow a return of downloaded Quicken from Amazon, so I am stuck with a program which I will not use.
657	1	bueno
658	-1	I understand the need for businesses to be sustainable, but really? I have to spend $500 per year on software now? Subscription services just keep adding up.
659	-1	I installed protection,but was never able to register the product,that being said i do not know if i have anything i payed for.Is there a way you can check to see if it has been installed,and registered.R.Kaser.
660	1	Hi everyone I just got hired onto intuit for a seasonal position. When I heard of this change I was nervous to take calls because how mad everyone is but I have good news. We were just told in a few weeks the upgrade will be free so if you haven't done your taxes yet wait! Then you won't have to pay to upgrade to a more expensive version and then next year they are going back to their old system.  Spread the word!
661	0	Been a windows user for years. Needed to move to a Mac, this version works but not as intuitive as the PC version.
662	-1	I just ordered this and not until I paid and download this version, did I see it reveal that it only works on Macs that are newer than my MacBook Air computer. I am so pissed off. I hate Amazon right now. I called their call center or rather they called me and of course the representaive was not from the United States or Canada , he was from India or someplace like that. His accent was so thick as he was telling me my $89.00 I just spent was spent down the hole! I am a student, I needed this Photoshop this week. I don't have money like that. But he could care less. I asked if I could exchange it being that it was never opened or installed. Nothing. I have been on hold for 20 minutes waiting for an answer. :-(
663	-1	it is only one 3pc down load weird you would think you get what the label says but no I tried to get my other pc to work then it didn't
664	0	everything you would expect problems included. office has always been a good and terrible product.<br />you are still get issues with updates even on a mac.
665	-1	No STAR,  3.5 is the most error filled, inadequate publishing software I have experienced. There are no updates to correct problems, service is non-existent. I will never purchase from Broderbund again.
666	-1	Actually cost me a tax penalty. Back to Turbo Tax.
667	0	Good protection for free, but expect to be constantly nagged to upgrade to a paid version.
668	0	It is as advertised. It is very overpriced. Have to pay extra for more fillings. Nothing bad nothing special. It works as expected. I give very high marks only  for extraordinary performance or features I did not expect.
669	-1	Paid 30 for download only to run program then be told that it is only a demo and would need to pay more for full version
670	0	Its a slow download and I have a high speed internet and an upgraded memory laptop (its very fast) but the download still takes 15 minutes. The program said I could start using the program but I could not get it started.
671	-1	"I have been an avid quicken user for over a decade. With each new upgrade, there are always some growing pains and a learning curve. But, with this newest edition and the mobile app, even after owning the product for 2 months I am still having issues with the desktop version. And the mobile app is useless. The main problem I am having with the desktop version is it's failure to download transactions from my bank. I have several accounts at one bank, and the program fails to communicate with this bank to download transactions. One day it will be working just fine, and the next, the program thinks that this account isn't at the bank and suggests I remove it from one-step update. I have deactivated and reactivated one-step update so many times, it is almost comical.<br /><br />Now for the mobile app. Useless. Waste of disk space. The mobile app doesn't do anything I need it to do. First of all it gives only gives you your online balance (which I can get more quickly from my own bank's app) or your ending balance. Not what your balance is today. (For example, I enter all my bills into my register at the beginning of the month, dated to the day they actually get paid, so they are technically, \\""pending\\"" transactions. This way, I can see if I am going to run out of cash before the next pay day.) The mobile app doesn't give you your balance on any given day, and it doesn't give you your daily balance like it does on the desktop version. The other issue, is it's failure to allow you to edit a split transaction if it was entered on the desktop. You can't transfer money between accounts on the mobile version. If you enter a transaction in the mobile app, the desktop version treats it as a downloaded transaction from a bank. Then, when you try to reconcile, you have to unclear the transaction in order for it to balance.<br /><br />Don't waste your money, stay with the older version until they fix this fiasco."
672	0	Did not work.  Oh well it's free.
673	1	Better every year.
674	0	I am a long time Quicken user.  I stopped buying every year, since I did not see the additional value for the price.  They should reinstitute discounts for current owners of the most recent version to get me back.  Also, in 2013 Home & Business, there are three areas for concern.<br /><br />First, it is much slower to respond, and you have an extra step to go into a schedule item to make changes.  Not sure why.  Second, the calendar, which I use to see my budget for the month at a glance, does not let you select which accounts make up the running total AND does not allow you to turn that feature off.  That is a wasteful oversight that they should fix right away.  Lastly, the tax planner is a great feature.  Every year I would use that to keep track, but also to give me an idea in January what I am looking at for taxes for the past year before I start my tax prep.  This version, for some reason, does not let me change the tax year to 2012!!!  I change it, then jump out to see the summary and it magically switches it back to 2013!  That is very poor quality control.  A very simple test, but clearly Intuit has lost their way, since both features that frustrate me are feature that are easy to test and replicate my problem.  For those that require those features, talk to customer service before you buy to see if they plan on fixing this soon.
675	1	Successfully used this AV for countless years, different PC's and OS's.<br /><br />They've played with the interface and features through the years but the current implementation is fine.
676	-1	Very disappointed to come to do my State and they ask for an additional $39.95!! This is the same program I have purchased for many years, and it included the state. Very misleading.  So I guess it wasn't a very good deal, I have to spend more money and download the state. Unhappy customer.
677	1	As usual, TurboTax Deluxe suited my needs perfectly, as it has for the past few years. The one thing that bothers me is why I had to pay a third party middleman to 'process' my federal refund this year. There has never been a charge like this in prior years as the direct deposit came directly from the U. S. Treasury. Hopefully, someone has a rational answer/explanation for this change.
678	0	I was to be allowed one free state filing but was never able to retrieve it.  This cost me $19.99.  Not very fair !
679	0	It is better than some programs that I have used.<br />Sometimes hard to get fromation where you want.<br />Better than doing it by pen and paper.
680	1	Gets the job done, without a steep learning curve. I would like even less automation - maybe it is me, but I've never had it suggest or automatically do anything I want. There have been complaints about versions loose functionality after 3 years. It would be best if Quicken would just say that it is a 3 year program - and the buyer can decide if the price divided by 3 is acceptable to him on an annual basis. Be careful to renew in time, or past data will be lost.
681	-1	Quicken H & B is a very poor accounting program.
682	0	Pretty good PDF app.  I've used others and this one is OK but it wasn't obvious to me that this is a trial version - only good for 30 days.  I sort of felt scammed.  Anyway, it was only 14 or 15 bucks.
683	0	Computer seems secure, but at a high price.  Next time I'll probably think ahead and shop around more.  I think I can get a lot more bang for the buck by getting informed ahead of time and buying smart instead of expensive.
684	1	Great product!  Norton is always a solid choice.
685	1	I upgraded from quicken 2010. I have not experienced the issues others have reported. Initially the software would incur an error when editing a transaction and close. That seems to be resolved. I love the cloud backup option. The mobile app is wonderful.
686	-1	I was very disappointed this year.  It seems different, Hard to use.
687	-1	I did not download this because its old and do not think it would work on windows 7 or 8
688	-1	Is there anything less than ZERO stars? Adobe is digging their grave with this one. I will NEVER pay a monthly fee to use RENTED software. This is an absurd and ridiculous move by Adobe. I want software I can install on my machine and use where and when I want, I think Adobe now must be run by the Islamic State.
689	1	Half price than elan where else. Works great, only drawback is updates and uses quiet bit of pc resources. I have it installed on my daily laptop so I don't care that much when Web browsing. On my gaming/video editing rig I have webroot installed because it's light on cpu and if you are gamer or video editor then you need every bit of juice out of your cpu.
690	0	I don't like that you have to buy new software every three years and there is no real improvement made. I've been using quicken for over a decade and am less impressed as the years pass.
691	1	As a CPA, being able to ask a client about a specific transaction is an amazing feature of 2014. For small business owners, this means asking your accountant questions with transaction references is open 24/7!
692	0	Turbo Tax is great.  I've used it for many years.  This year wasn't as good an experience.  I was part way through and they wanted me to ante up an extra $39 for added software to report capital gains.  I figured it wasn't worth it so I didn't report my capital gains this year.  Didn't think it would make that much difference.  I was interupted several times so I tried to continue where I'd left off.  As a result, TT downloaded my bank interest twice, and I didn't notice it until after I e filed.  Big mistake.  I'll have to do the whole thing over and file an amended return.  Will I use TT next year?  Maybe not.
693	1	I have had the ComiPo software for just under a year, I do own the additional expansions as well but have only had those for about 4 months.  I have been very pleased with the software and what it has allowed me to do with my storyline (which would have gone unwritten without it).<br /><br />-  ComiPo is great if you have limited drawing/painting skills and are looking to make a Slice of Life style Manga.  You don’t even need much technical knowledge because everything is drag and drop/click on menus.<br />- ComiPo’s user community is very supportive.  You can find a couple of groups on DeviantArt that will help you share your creations and are willing to give you feedback to make your manga better.  There are also great tutorials and additional fan made content to extend your story telling options.<br />- ComiPo is limited.  Without being able to make 2D or 3D art yourself it can be a challenge to do all the things you dream of because of the limited number of models and slow updates from ComiPo.  Currently JPN’s version has 2-3 additional paid packs more than the ENG/Steam versions available and almost twice the amount of free content.<br />- It is easy to add additional content you make or find to the folders.<br />- You can not always get the characters in the positions you want because there is no 3D skeleton manipulations, all the poses are pre-set.  Though there are extra poses for swimming or sports, but those are only available from added content packs and if your characters are wearing swimsuits or sports ware at the time.<br />- Not all of the background art that comes with the program are good quality.  Many of them were probably photographs that were put through a digital wash to make them look more cartoony.  Because of this many of them are grainy or pixely and add a stark contrast to the smooth 3D characters.<br />- It does get expensive after a while.  $50 for the original, $15-25 dollars per additional content pack.  You can sometimes find iton sale from different retailers.  However make sure you pick a company with good and supportive customer service.  If you lose or misplace your key you will have to contact the company you purchased it through not the ComiPo company.<br />- ComiPo will work on Windows 8/8.1 if you download a software patch located on the ComiPo website.<br /><br />If you would like to see some of what the program can do and if it will work for your needs, feel free to check out my manga “Mission Mars” at http://missionmars.webcomic.ws/
694	-1	It constantly needs to be updated.  Let's loosely define &#34;constant&#34; as weekly.  Half the time I am pretty sure it forces me to update just to give another chance to try and sell me some things or try to install its browser of choice.  It's free, sort of.  Though I'm not convinced it's worth the hassle.
695	-1	The ads were killing me Smalls.
696	1	Went with this software this year because of the outrageous price increases from Turbotax, which I had previously used for years.  I will never go back.  The H&R Block software was not only less expensive, but better.
697	0	I've only used it for a couple of weeks but this release has crashed on multiple occasions and concerns me.  I may revert to the 2013 version which didn't exhibit that behavior.
698	0	I had to pay an additional $30 for the state e file, making this &#34;bundle&#34; more expensive than buying it elsewhere.
699	1	Work as easy as other tools that I have used.
700	0	I love the program but the instructions were blurred.  I finally found a phone number and got technical support:  YEAH!  I bought the 3 PC so I had three calls in to get the protection on each because I was not wireless and had only one incoming internet (my fault-now wireless). I opted for the Hands On choice where the technical person took control of my computer to get it loaded.  I used this service on all three machines and not a single one of them was easy (straight forward if you will).  It is not easy to add a McAfee if bought other than McAfee.  There were so many things that I did not know.  Now that I am established....maybe it will be easier next year.  I can only hope-anyway: there is the Hands On!  Love the product.
701	0	Way too steep a learning curve unless you have lots and lots of time on your hands.
702	-1	I ordered this online and downloaded the software after seeing the bad reviews for turbotax. I have used turbotax for many years. Well this started out fine but it does not have the 3 financial intitutions that I use available for import of 1099s (Wells fargo, Etrade, and BBT). It also will not import complicated S corporation forms. I don't like turbo tax pulling the downgrade stunt but H & R needs to be more competitive and update there import availability.
703	1	Especially glad Avast still supports Windows  xp.
704	1	Easy as pie.
705	-1	Overpriced and you pay fees if you choose to efile and process return. This is not clear in advertising.  Also cannot file as software is still waiting for irs forms...
706	-1	I purchased this full interent security suite. I still got infected witha virus, as well as let in 100's malware. I tried to c about a refund, they were not helpful
707	-1	not exactly as easy to use as i thought it would be
708	-1	Never wrote a review, product handled my checking accounts fine for about a year. Then Intuit disabled the ability to download from the bank. Only reason I bought the program, and without even asking took away the feature. Strikes me as fraud - my bank has no issue with me using this version of the software, why does Intuit? Filed complaint with BBB and FTC for fraud.
709	-1	Downloaded the product thinking I'd actually be able to use it.  Wouldn't open and tech support tells me 48hrs.  DO NOT BUY.  Leads to nothing but frustration.  When they actually have some sort of tech support and a product that works I'll change my score.  Until then, run.
710	1	very good product<br />excellent protection<br />i recommend it<br />i use norton products for the last 5 yeras and i am very satisfied!!!!
711	1	I was using Elements 8 before this. I love how much better the magic wand tool works in 12 and I also like how they went about picturing the editing preview when editing photos.<br /><br />The only thing I really preferred in 8 is how much simpler it is to drag and drop things between files you are working on. You can have 2+ different files open in 8, but you can only have one open in 12. You have to switch between them, which can be tedious when working with many different files.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a very easy to use program.
712	-1	I purchased this to improve on network connection going from Windows 8.1 to 8.1 Pro which is what the Pro was suppose to correct. I am still having some issues. I'm not sure if I would have had better luck with installing a full version or not.
713	-1	I hate Taxes....but this a great program
714	-1	"I guess there's a reason it's less than half the Garmin price.  \\""Our system is experiencing difficulty processing your card. Please try this process again. If difficulties persist, contact Garmin Product support for assistance.\\"""
715	-1	the download went well I guess but when I bring up the program to use the word processor it will not bring it up so I have not been able to use the program I would like to have a refund to my so maybe I can buy something that will work for me. john cross
716	1	My sister used HR Block tax software. It was soo bad she had to do it by hand. She will be using turbo tax for now on.
717	1	Quicken 14 is every bit as easy as all previous years, and this year has added even more reasons for using.
718	0	Perhaps my opinion will change as I get used to this program.  I went from a 2001 to a 2013, so there are a lot of changes not easy to understand or handle.  So far the WORST thing would be trying to print my checks.  And I don't like the fact that my register disappears after I finally manage to print one (which I can't use because I set it up wrong).  And I ruined about 12 checks, because it won't let me use the same number to try to REPRINT it  Not happy yet.
719	0	I have used Norton for many years, but I always purchased the disk.  I had 5 days remaining on my old subscription when I downloaded this one.  After I downloaded it, it indicated that I still had 5 days.  It did not ask for a key code directly during the download process.  I figured that the key code was the problem, but didn't see where to enter it.  So I looked on Norton's &#34;help&#34; documentation. It said to look under &#34;account&#34; for the &#34;enter key code&#34; option, which is not there.  I asked Norton, they key code entry was under the &#34;Support&#34; tab, and that Norton's online documentation in question was for old versions.  Hello?  I would think Norton would be the first to be advised of the release of &#34;new&#34; versions of their own product and change their documentation accordingly.<br />I can't really comment on how well the 2014 version works, as I have only very recently downloaded it.  However, Norton products have worked well for me in the past.  I gave it 3 stars on the basis - customer service and up to date &#34;help&#34; documentation ARE part of any software, and Norton did not update theirs.
720	-1	I have not been pleased with this.  I have used Printmaster 17 for a long time and tried to use the disk to put it on my new laptop and it wouldn't work so I bought this online and it doesn't seem to have near as much clip art.  It seems more difficult to use and I am having problems printing.  In fact, I can't get it to print at all!  I wish I knew how I could return it and get my money back!
721	-1	"I just tried to download Taxcut 2008 (4/11/09). Following other people's suggestion, I installed Amazon's software downloader first, then downloaded a free game. When it all worked, I purchased the Taxcut software. Guess what? Didn't work. It kept trying to download for the longest time, and said there was a problem with the order. Apparently, what they don't tell you is that once you place an order with a credit card, especially on a weekend or evening hours, someone at Amazon needs to physically check on the credit card before releasing the order. So the order appears as \\""Pending\\"" until Monday morning. Your order is not released until then. This is inane; what is the point of ordering something for instant download, and then waiting for two days until some moron at Amazon physically clears the credit card? I wish I had not ordered this, and instead just gone to my local BestBuy to get the CD version. Won't be buying software from Amazon in the future, I guess!!! I suspect the reviewers who report having no problems with the download are the ones who downloaded the software during normal business hours (M-F 9-5). Those who try purchasing over the weekend or overnight are screwed. I thought Amazon was smarter than this!!!!"
722	0	The new look and the glitches that have happened make it hard to be excited about this upgrade.  This has not been a smooth transition.
723	1	Turbo Tax for 2014 is much easier to navigate.
724	0	It seemed to be easy until I started the State tax, then it all went haywire. I ended up calling a tech who had difficulty figuring out how to resolve the issue. After it was all thought to be resolved we found that we had to go back in and change a number of answers that were never asked in the first place. It seemed to have a mind of its own. I paid for a product that was inferior, and quite disappointing.
725	0	This product is as expected.  It is slightly confusing to configure, but manageable.  There were a couple of bugs that came after installation that forced me to do a reinstall
726	1	good
727	-1	Wow, was just about to buy 2014, and then I read the reviews and decided against it! I guess I will stick with my 2010 for a while longer. Thanks everyone!
728	1	Works great
729	-1	I used the bill pay from quicken but stopped using it years ago. I called customer service to stop the charges and was tossed from one number to another number to another number and was on hold for over 1 hour. They still couldn't stop the charges. When I asked for a supervisor, none was available. It was a bank problem and not theirs. I do not recommend using any of the bill paying services with them and good luck if you need to use customer service.
730	-1	I guess I should have done my research first, but now here I am, can't return it, it won't work. Not happy at all.
731	-1	The ad indicatedthat there was a name and address directory,  which was my reason for purchasing it. There should be a tutorial to show how to access it out a contact reference.
732	-1	I was unable to install this program unless I subscribed to a monthly payment program.<br /><br />I have instead gotten Apple's new Photo program.
733	0	While the program is simple, I did not like the surprise at the end ($20 to e-file). This detracted from the attractive cost of Federal & State.
734	1	Gotta have it! :-(
735	-1	If I could get my money back I would. This product found the virus, could not clean/fix/delete it. As much as I dislike Norton products I had to go to the store and buy Norton Anti-virus. I guess you get what you pay for.
736	1	This was excellent for me.  Although it cleaned some items I wanted to keep, I was able to recover it back.  My pc is three years old and I have never did a pc clean up on it.  It only took about an hour to clean my pc.
737	-1	I am very frustrated about this not working, I have gone back and forth, from amazon to Microsoft trying to get this resolved.  I finally received a refund from Amazon.  After all the hassle, I still don't have the software that I needed two days ago.  The question is, do I try to download again or  spend the extra money and buy it a different way.  This was a total pain in my neck!!!!
738	0	I use Norton 360 exclusively  I bought new laptop last June and got Norton 360 right away.  However I bought this too soon. as my present expires July 8 . so I will download it then..
739	-1	I rate this product as worthless. I paid $25.90 for a worthless download link. No matter what changes I make to the firewall or security settings I still  cannot download it. I spent more the 3 hours trying to make it work. I always get a message that there is a Network Error even though there was no problem when it came to Amazon taking my payment. Conveniently for them, they have a no return policy for downloadable software. Never would buy downloadable software from Amazon again. Advise everyone else to go elsewhere as well.
740	1	Some minor problems with the download & installation but worth it considering April 15 is around the corner. Most people should be able to download and install this in about 15 to 20 minutes.    I used Microsoft Vista Basic OS.    Expect to see several error messages on the two (2) separate downloads/installations; One for Amazon's software downloader and one for the TaxCut08 software w/ bonus software.    Take a Deep Breath and DON'T Worry! Amazon's website CLEARLY walks you through the error messages.    Once the compressed TaxCut software is downloaded, it could be tricky finding the installation file.    It's located in the folder C:\Program Files\TaxCut08\Setup.    To wrap up, I'm sure installing from a physical CD is EASIER if you already have the CD. But if you don't, take the extra 15 minutes to save you 2 to 5 days of waiting for it in the mail or paying upwards of $20 more w/ sales taxes & gas to buy it at your local store.
741	-1	What a piece of junk! I have had Rental Manager 2.5 for at at least 3 years now and it was easy to use. I decided to buy Rental Manager 2011 as an upgrade. An upgrade it is NOT. My many years of data is lost. I have to connect to my bank for it to work properly. Which I will not.  So if you are in the mood to be frustrated and angry that you wasted your $$, by all means buy this junk. Otherwise I just re-installed Rntal Manager 2.5 and I am very happy now.
742	-1	I have tried many times to download it & I cannot! I want help or my money back!!!
743	-1	Much slower than the last version. There are no improvements worth the money I paid for it but I was forced to buy it to keep my online banking..
744	0	Thanks to avast free antivirus program for keeping my computer safe from hackers. I am a retired teacher with limited income and this software is helpful. The reason I am giving this rating is that free version has limited benefits and vendor keep sending message to purchase this software. Thanks.
745	0	Functional!!
746	-1	Sad I wasted $32, but had to find out for myself. This is not as advertised, unless the professional dj is 3 years old. There is the worse pause between mixing. The uploading of tracks are horrid. If they had a rating system in the negative, I'd gave it -5*<br /><br />Stick to Virtual DJ or Trakktor
747	0	I give you three stars and not five because of the price you charged me to add the State return after I had forgot to add it to my purchase. For what you charged me for the state return I could have purchased another tax program with Federal and state for less than what you charged me. I will reconsider weather to use you next year because of this overcharge, in my opnion.
748	-1	I need IE for work and having it sabotaged by Outlook was unacceptable.  When I tried to reinstall it, I got error messages, &#34;something wrong&#34; and &#34;does not recognize your operating system&#34;, which is Windows 7.  Very frustrating.  How did MS ever make so much $$?
749	1	Good product; same as before. Did not appreciate all the confusion on the rollout of this years edition.
750	1	only had problems with updating my downloads.  otherwise was very easy.
751	-1	"Well, I had read reviews here and elsewhere so I know it was going to be bad.  Unfortunately, Intuit updated my existing Q2009 product to withdraw online banking in order to force us all to upgrade.  Well, it worked on me since I didn't want to manually download and import transactions.  So, I now have Q2012.  I've got an online account for which I've changed the password.  The account is not in the password vault though it is trying to update (and gets an error).  Trying to deactivate the account hangs Q2012 and I have to kill it with task manager.  I've spent 1.5 hours with chat support with them figuring out that what I described here is accurate.  They then turned me over to online banking \\""support\\"" who I've now gone several useless rounds with.  First they asked me for logs.  Then they asked me to do what's in a KB entry that is specific to *their* disconnecting the link to *USAA* (not my bank).  I asked them what they expected me to do with that entry.  They responded, oh, yeah well then we suggest you deactivate the account - which, of course my inability to do was the source of the original problem report."
752	-1	Attempting to use this software as the personal representative of a deceased taxpayer left a great deal to be desired.  A question regarding the use of an Employer ID Number (provided to me by the IRS) vs. the use of a Form 1310 was never resolved.  The tax help chat line could not answer my question, at which time I was referred to a non-existent link in the software program.  And, it took a long time for the HRB &#34;assistant&#34; to tell me that they didn't know the answer.  In fact, it took a considerable time to get a non-answer from the IRS as well, but that's expected.<br />I'm not sure that Turbotax is any better (based on reviews, I'd say no better).  Next year, I'll search for a better alternative, if one exists.
753	1	Used Norton for years....hard to beat! Would recommend it if shopping for a good product!  Good customer support should you need it!
754	1	Have used this product for years and have always gotten great results for free.  I would recommend this product to all my friends!
755	1	This was much easier to use than HR Block Home. I received roughly the same return as last year but it was a faster process with this version.
756	0	I didn't get all the codes that should have come with it.
757	-1	I switch to Quicken Home and Business to replace Microsoft Money Small Business as it will no longer be supported.  Quicken is a big step backward with far less ability to customize and fewer business tools.  It's appears to be Quicken with a Quickbooks Lite designed to get you to switch to Quickbooks which I don't want.
758	0	If you don't have ISO stock option exercise, then the Deluxe version might be just for you. But if you do and need to calculate AMT tax due to the difference in exercise price and fair market price, then there is no way to enter that in the software. Neither the dialogue prompts you (there are several unrelated ISO option questions), nor can you directly enter the amount in the tax form 6251 for AMT. This can be a major shortcoming if you need to do that.<br /><br />I am not sure if Premium version has that. Maybe you can try that but it is a dismay that the software does not even provide a manual way to enter that.
759	0	This was part of my migration from a MacBook Pro to the Surface Pro.  Perhaps I was spoiled by Mac programs and functionality for cutting, pasting and working with images, but the MacBook was 5 years old.  It's disappointing that Adobe still hasn't caught up to 5 year old standards.  The functions can mostly eventually be created with work-arounds and lots of extra steps.  There's nothing intuitive about functionality and it's hard to believe that I can't open a psd file using Adobe software.  I was expecting more/better.
760	1	Great product as always Microsoft
761	-1	Would not work with new windows and could not return item because it was downloaded.
762	-1	Has pop ups that show up on every site you get on. You can not utilize the site until all the pop ups are on the screen.
763	-1	After a while the download just up and expire and have to purchase another one again. I feel I should get my money back since its not for another year.
764	0	I like Quickbooks. It's not perfect, but I've always found it easy to use for me to manage my day to day accounts for my consulting business. My upgrade from QB2012 went smoothly with no issues.<br /><br />I don't see any feature improvements over the 2012 version, although I do find the &#34;Snapshots&#34; view to be quite nice. The much-hyped insights view that I upgraded just to have doesn't work for me because I use multiple currencies.<br /><br />I find the new layout to be awful. The colours are terrible to work with and text difficult to read. And I'm a fairly young person.<br /><br />The only reason I upgraded was to ensure that future upgrades are not affected because of running too old a version. Otherwise, I would skip this version. It seems that Intuit made superficial changes to make the upgrade seem like a big change, which it's not.
765	0	Wonderful product
766	1	I'm a beginning user and still learning, but I'm very impressed with all that this software can do.  Very pleased!
767	1	I've been using Norton for many years. I trust that program to get the job done and protect our pc.
768	1	Great product that works really well with the system without interfering with any other software, unless of course it is a threat. Thank you Avast.
769	-1	Not worth the money. Using on iPhone and samsung phones worthless
770	-1	I used a previous Kaspersky Internet Security 2013 on my Windows 8 PC for the past two years. I didn't have strong feelings about it one way or another, but I also didn't use the computer much because I thought the computer was too slow. When I purchased an activation code for the next year, I was forced to upgrade to 2015. The 2015 version is AWFUL. Once it was installed we could no long send e-mail from Microsoft Outlook. I googled the problem and found that this seemed to be a common complaint among users of this software. I tried several work-arounds suggested by on-line forums including disabling the anti-spam add-on. We still couldn't send e-mail. So we contacted technical support. First, they claimed that they didn't know this was a commonly reported problem. Instead of logging onto our computer remotely, technical support said that they would e-mail us instructions to fix the issue. The instructions the sent us basically instructed us how to disable all Kaspersky protection for incoming/outgoing e-mail. This, obviously, was not the solution we wanted, but we tried it, and it did not solve our problem. Technical support subsequently (over e-mail) sent us several additional suggestions that did not work. Therefore, we initiated the 30 day money back guarantee process and bought Webroot. Once Kaspersky was uninstalled Outlook worked fine. Webroot also found 14 infections that Kaspersky had never detected. And for the first time since we purchased the computer, it was fast.
771	1	This is the best money I have ever spent on a workout program. She tells you what to expect during the workout, how to adjust the moves to your level, and provides a clear view of her doing the exercises with you. It is so easy to adjust it to your workout level.<br />  In 4 weeks I have increased my strength and endurance.  I exercise in a small area of my living room, and I am sweating by the time I am done. I feel really good about my workouts. It is like having a personal coach, who comes into your living room, encourages you and makes you push yourself to get in shape.  The variety and challenge is what keeps me committed to doing this. Also, I tell myself you can do 30 minutes...just hit start and France will keep me motivated!
772	1	I have gone through several of these over the last couple of years, deploying for customers and custom-building systems for SMB or LAN groups.  This version - Home & Student 3-pc license - is the best bang-for-your-buck in the office suite for anyone NOT in a business environment.  It has the four most commonly-used programs in the suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote).  With more and more cloud usage for email and the general bend of business toward hosted SQL database services, even many smaller businesses don't need the extras found in Business and Professional packages (Access, Outlook, Project, Visio, Groove, InfoPath), and if you aren't going to be using a feature regularly, don't pay for it.<br /><br />Office 2010 is an improvement on Office 2007, though there is little visual clues to that.  The ribbons are still there, the interfaces and interactions are still basically the same, but Office 2010 has run a bit better in my experience and the backend model has been improved for interoperability and flexibility.  One thing that new users will need to know is that you activate Office 2010 from the 'File/Help' menu in the program itself instead of when you install the program.  This card also works with the pre-installed 'trial' versions found on a lot of branded PCs and Laptops these days.
773	1	What can I say, it's QuickBooks. It does what its suppose to do. It does require more system resources than the previous version of QB (2010). The response on my 4 year old laptop is quite a bit slower. Maybe now I have a reason to buy a new laptop.
774	0	Turbo Tax is a good tax product but overpriced.  The trick is to use the 10% rebate.  I get a large refund every year.  I apply about $2000 to an Amazon gift card which gives me and extra $200.  So, I make a profit of about $150 by using TurboTax.  When they drop the 10% rebate, I drop expensive TurboTax.
775	0	Easy to use, not clear if it made a big difference in performance but it is my old machine that my now uses mostly for email and pictures, so no heavy duty computing.
776	0	This was kind of a pain doing the reinstall but it seems to be working ok.  No known viruses yet.
777	-1	Essentials lacks reporting and printing capabilities that I require. I wasn't able to print bank reconciliations or produce a summary balance sheet and summary profit and loss statement in a format that I could easily use. I found it hard to take the information and transfer it to personal financial statements and tax preparation forms. While trying to analyze and update information in one account, I had lost access to every other account and had to download the software a second time and restore from my back up. I am a Controller for a $300 million dollar company who is familiar with financial software and would discourage any but the casual user who wants to use this program as a check register from purchasing it.
778	1	I've used Avast for the last 3 years, and I've never had any problems with viruses or malware on my computer, or mobile phone, I highly recommend Avast to anyone!
779	-1	Does not work. installs as &#34;Basic&#34; and then requires &#34;conformation code&#34; to upgrade. There is no way to get conformation code. I spent one hour on phone with Intuit and they couldn't make it work,
780	1	I downloaded it right from here even though others said it wouldn't work for them.  My computer is less than a year old so I am not sure if that helped.  My trial version of Microsoft Office had to be uninstalled in order for it to work, but a screen told me that which made it simple.  This whole cloud thing is pretty great for finding my homework on other people's computers and such.  Works for me!
781	-1	It never loaded. Therefore a fix is needed by the creator.
782	-1	BAD, VERY BAD, AND WORSE THAN VERY BAD PURE UGLY - I bought Bitdefender 3PCs/2Years from Amazon, originally to get rid of products like it. And Bitdefender, in my experience, is among the very worst.  Bitdefender first threatened to turn off their product after one year, on a two year 3 PC license agreement. They did this through one of the most irritating string of banner pop-up ads I have yet encountered.  Then, a year later, as the two-year license was really about to expire, they renewed the nettlesome pop-ups. These ads, in addition to being frequent and large, had a clever twist, when the big red kill X was selected, the ads merely sent more pop-ups.  Then after multiple attempts to uninstall Bitdefender using Windows 8 &#34;Programs and Features&#34; uninstall, it wouldn't uninstall.  When remove is selected within Bitdefender, instead of removing the program, it sends more ads. Your computer, your choice.   Getting through to Bitdefender, through their website or other search means, is impossible. Bitdefender, if you are listening, or for that matter, if you even care, any comments?  Please send them to albackus@gmail.com. Today is July 4, 2015. I’ll be updating this report with when and if Bitdefender responds. UPDATE Today is July 17, 2015.  No word yet.   Amazon, are you listening?
783	0	Originally I had given it a 1 star rating because it didnt work with my main bank and two of my credit cards.  Well after a week of trying to add my Primary bank it finally worked.  The two credit cards that didnt work are store cards manage by syncrony banks and they have blocked quicken from connecting directly.  But there is a current work around.   I can log into these two accounts and export my activity in a quicken formated file that I can then open with quicken and it adds the latest transactions to the list.
784	1	Granted, I'm a simple man with simple taxes, but TurboTax did the trick.
785	-1	Cant install and customer service is a waste.  I am having the same problem I had last year.  I am trying to install the windows version and it fails.  Something is blocking it from installing.  I searched online and their support pages are very generic and useless.  I called in and waited a long time for a call back.  The person calling backed needed to gather information like my email phone mailing address.  This is a waste of time and I told her I didnt want to give my mailing address. She said technical support would not speak to me without this info.  I told her I was returning this to the store and never using the product again.  She said ok, is there anything else I can help you with.  Nice attitude.  Many options exist as opposed to turbotax.  Good for me.
786	0	not bad for free I took it off my phone but still once the load back on I got a different adware back on
787	0	Turbo tax is okay, but could be much better.  There were a few deductions I had to find myself that Turbo Tax didn't find for me.  If someone has a simple tax situation then Turbo Tax should be fine.  If there are more complicated areas, then Turbo Tax may not be the best.
788	-1	This product seemed to be everything that would protect your computer . I ordered it got the code right away but still is very hard to down load worked on it the first day I got it and still have not got it installed on my computer. I liked the disc better that they use to send to you instead of the downloads it's awful.
789	1	worked very well
790	0	The download worked fine and the installation went without incident. However, Outlook has somehow stopped Norton Internet Security 2013 from putting anything in the SPAM or JUNK email folders. It's difficult to find features because the user interface has been modified for some unknown reason. I haven't even been able to get &#34;HELP-ABOUT&#34; to verify the version that I have. I've used Office for over 10 years and love it, but I wish they would stop tinkering with the UI or provide a way of selecting the old interface.
791	0	I just did not like the download copy and was not aware that the state was not included until after it was downloaded.  so I had to purchase it twice.
792	0	I have been using H & R Deluxe for six years and was very satisfied. This year, I had use the Premium because I needed Schedule C. I made a copy with instruction off the IRS website and manually filled the Schedule out. When I went to enter the data into the Premium software, it was difficult to navigate through all of the forms and I am still not sure if all my data was entered correctly. I hope next year this format will be enhanced and more user friendly.
793	1	This product performs more than expected well on creation of American viruses to thwart invading creations with warning at least of disposal at best.
794	-1	"I've used TurboTax for two decades to prepare my federal and state tax return. It does the job. For better or worse, I'm used to it. Yet it has needless weak points and provides needless annoyances.<br /><br />VAGUE ERROR MESSAGES: When TurboTax checks for errors in your return, the messages explaining the possible errors are often hard to understand.<br /><br />NAVIGATION: In preparing a long-form return on TurboTax, you will navigate through many, many pages (in my case, over 200). To reach the next page, you must go to the bottom of the current page and click \\""Continue.\\"" But the \\""Continue\\"" is hidden behind the Windows 7 taskbar (at least on my Lenovo Thinkpad), even on pages that contain only a few lines of text. You need to click on the page and scroll to the bottom before you can see and click \\""Continue.\\""<br /><br />EXTRA CHARGE: TurboTax will charge you extra for e-filing your state return. It should disclose that charge clearly and specifically before you buy the product.<br /><br />UPGRADES: Be wary of buying the many upgrades and additional services TurboTax will offer. Most users of TurboTax Deluxe will derive little additional benefit from them.<br /><br />SELF-SERVING CHATTER: As you proceed through your return, you face recurring chatter implying that you owe your deductions and credits to TurboTax. It labels your total federal deductions, \\""federal deductions we found for you.\\"" It labels your total state deductions, \\""state deductions we found for you.\\"" As though you would have had no deductions or credits at all but for using TurboTax.<br /><br />PERSONAL INFORMATION: When you first open this software, TurboTax demands a full page of contact information, including your mobile telephone number. It says it demands this information so it can notify you if the rules change. I provided all the requested information except my phone number. But that wasn't good enough for TurboTax. For the next ten or so times that I opened the software, it made me start withthe contact-information screen. I'd already given TurboTax my e-mail address; it didn't need my phone number. Once TurboTax has your phone number, it's free to make telemarketing calls. To prevent those calls, you need to go through the separate exercise of changing your contact preferences. And you can't do even that without giving TurboTax your daytime phone number."
795	0	The Quicken 2013 download went fine but I am frustrated with some problems I'm having. I wanted to ensure the Quicken 2013 download was registered to my account. However, despite my having my password, I couldn't find my username. Quicken Tech Support suggested I open a new account which I did but I still don't know how to register my Quicken 2013 download to my new account. Further, when I click Update Transactions, in the past both my checking and savings accounts were downloaded. Now, only the checking account is downloaded. Quicken issues a statement to the effect one account successfully downloaded and one account not successfully downloaded. These problems may have nothing to do with my updating to Quicken 2013 but the bank says it is a Quicken problem. I have the same password for both accounts and that password has not changed.
796	0	I like the program. IT IS BETTER THAN GOING DIRECTLY TO H&R BLOCK office. There is no Schedule M1PR for the MN add-on.
797	0	I had to upgrade a laptop already running Win 7 home version to make my laptop able to run some business apps.  The Amazon download process worked just fine.  No issues with that at all, THAT part earns Amazon 5 stars.  The low rating for the PRODUCT is due to the fact I am not a fan of Microsoft.<br /><br />I am technically savvy engineer / business owner, not an IT professional, but I can fix and maintain all the hardware I use.  Windows 7 is typical MS bloat ware.  It takes forever to boot on my 2 year old Acer compared to Snow Leopard 5 on my year old macbook (YES I have maintained the hard drive, done all the necessary maintenance and upgraded the memory).  Windows code just can't keep pace with Mac OS. Just MY experience, YMMV.<br /><br />Ok, my rant is over.  If you need to work in a Windows environment and can't use XP Professional, this is as good as it gets.
798	-1	"I upgraded my Quicken from 2012 to 2013 version, and do not see any major improvements in the way the product is working. The only feature they have added is a cloud backup and access through a SmartPhone. Even there I think they borrowed the iPad app from Mint (since Mint was acquired by Intuit a few years back). So I dont think there is anything new in this version. I feel like I wasted some money on this \\""so called\\"" upgrade."
799	0	Quicken 2013 is just a retread of earlier versions with a new associated smartphone app.  Frankly, it looks and acts exactly like 2011 that I replaced.  Intuit seems to add more and more &#34;finacial planning&#34; features which I have no interest in and the smartphone app is less than spectacular.  Were I to do it again, I wouldn't!
800	1	Works on windows 10.
801	-1	I bought this software thinking I could do a FAST logo for a small start up company.  I crashed all the time and will not let me save or Save as.  The only way to exit is to force quit the program and then all my changes are lost!  I am so very disappointed !!!
802	0	Screen offers help to click below.  No link?..  It's not seamless and a little daunting.  Familiar actions are in unfamiliar places.  Many crashes and glitches.  Hopefully it will improve with updates
803	0	but I found other e-file options to work better for my needs at the same cost.  For those not accustomed to doing their own taxes on a regular basis, this might be a good option.
804	-1	"Buyer Beware!  I should have read the reviews but I was in a hurry to reload my mother's computer and was happy to see I could download a program for her and get her up and running.  I purchased this product for my mother who was using an older version of Quicken for basically keeping track of her checkbook.  Their house (and computer) was struck by lightning and they had to repurchase several appliances due to the lightning strike (in addition to having to rewire most of the house). I got this starter version because she really needs it for ONE account -  Apparently though, she was using an old Home & Business edition with it and like other users, I saw too late that you can't import any other version into this one.  So I'm supposed to \\""Upgrade\\"" her to a version she doesn't use the features on for $70?  Seriously a crock.  Of course, after years of having to use Quickbooks, I'm not super surprised.  You don't know how many times I've wished for someone, anyone to create a better program than those offered by Intuit.  They aren't user friendly, the support stinks (I've had to contact it many, many times) it's full of bugs and they force you to pay for just about every \\""service\\"" the programs offer.  Annoying.  I refuse to pay $70 for an upgrade so I'm just going to have her start over on her accounts and use it from here.  Just another example of how Intuit stinks.  And sorry, if a rep writes me offering \\""help\\"", I don't have 3 hours to sit on the phone and listen to why you do things the way you do and offer a special \\""upgrade\\"" price only to have to deal with all the little glitches and such."
805	-1	I have not even been able to start the product without receiving a COM error.  The product is error ridden.  I need compatibility but my old Quick Books would not open a QB2012 product.  It is disgraceful that you pay for something that does not work.  No response from reporting the errors and a search of the internet reveals the COM error is not resolved.
806	-1	Avast is a Virus! Their whole communication system is overwrought and intentionally complicated, its a very SHADY company, after spending 60 worthless minutes on the phone with these &#34;people' i was advised that I would have to pay $77 for getting my comp in order, I told that &#34;lady&#34; where to stuff it i am pretty savvy and have good &#34;scam antenna&#34; but i feel sorry for the ones who fall for this thievery. They actually asked me questions like &#34;do you do your banking on this computer&#34;? Do you have financial records? Imagine this. Creeps!
807	1	I just started using QB Online and I am decidedly NOT an accountant. I do marketing, and do it well, which is why I started my business. But I must keep track of revenue, expenses, invoices, payments, etc., and that's where QuickBooks Online comes in.<br /><br />Very intuitive, very easy, gets the job done.<br /><br />I like having a cloud-based resource that I can count on and access from anywhere. It's connected to my other financial tools, making tracking credit card purchases, etc. simple.
808	0	Quickbooks refused to provided technical support for two separate  QuickBooks Pro operating in two user mode.  The sale descriptions should have said.  &#34;You must purchase a two licensee-two user version if you want to have two users operating on the same set of books. QuickBooks will will not provide technical support for two independent one user versions operating in two user mode.&#34;
809	1	a very good deal
810	1	Works great. A must have with so many devices to deal with.
811	1	helps you keep on track of your money
812	0	for the past few years I have used H&R block.  I can't say this is any better or worse.  I think i will be going back to H&R block because I like it a little better

814	0	This version lacks some features that are on the higher priced packages. But, I don't miss those features. Interface with other programs is often slow and erratic. I use the simple word processor that comes with Dragon then cut and paste into other programs as needed. The bottom line is voice recognition. It is far from perfect but still quite useful for some one with clunky fingers like me. The program will often surprise me with what it can recognize faithfully, and also surprises me with what it doesn't know or doesn't reproduce faithfully. It is a mix. I don't think the learning feature works very well. I try to train it to recognize certain words but he program often ignores me and defaults to the undesired response. For people who type very well this program may be more of an intrusion than a help.
815	0	Seems OK.  About like last year's.  They did add in the schedule D forms --perhaps after all the complaints.  I'll stay with them for a while.
816	-1	I have used TurboTax software for several years, but this year I tried the download version. I don't think I'll do that again. After downloading, I did the taxes and (as usual) I was owed a refund from the federal government but owed money to the state government. So I filed the federal form and waited closer to the deadline to file the state form. However, when I went to file the state form it had disappeared and I had to redo my taxes and file a paper form. That's not exactly what I paid for. I discovered just how hard it is to get any answers from the company if there are problems. They kept directing me to an online forum with other users. That's poor service, in my opinion, and just a way for the company to get out of paying employees to do the work.
817	-1	I have used Q 13 for a year and recently am having a download problem with Vanguard - they are working on it, but  maybe they need some help.  Hoping that Q 14 would fix the problem I bought it and loaded it.  It did NOT fix the Vanguard problem and refused to talk with BB&T.  I contacted them and they said it would be late November when Q 14 would work.  I took down Q 14 and went back to Q 13.<br /><br />So my result is that I switched too early or Quicken didn't have its ducks in a row and still released it.  Since I will eventually use it I have not returned it but have not used it either.<br /><br />Vernon Mountcastle
818	1	I owed taxes this year so I'm rating this product 1 out of 5 stars just kidding H&R Block is great it's not their fault I got behind on my paperwork.
819	1	I very much like the latest version of Quicken 2014 for my PC,  I was not unhappy with my 2011 copy but in order to maintain the banking downloads I had to upgrade.  I don't mind because I know software companies can't support all their versions.  This does everything I need in my way of banking.  And you can't complain about the price!
820	0	Started with Tax Cut 15 years ago which was great then and have just stayed with the now H&R Block product as too lazy to learn a new business tax software -- but that's not to say that I LIKE this software.  I feel that the programers are overseas and the software is not properly tested before released -- and options that worked last year don't this year (ie I can't find where it will forecast the 2015 depreciation expense which it did last year). Also chat support is so, so and phone support not anything better.  On the plus side, the software has ALL your tax forms for any small business.  So, it is one stop shopping for forms if you need 1065; 1120; 1120S, etc..  I again purchased this years business tax return. And right off the bat, I had a problem in that the 2014 version would not import my 2013 business tax returns.  It did not even see them in the folder and the import message was &#34;no files in this folder&#34;.  Last year, I had prepared the tax returns on an XP system and this year, I was working on a new Windows 7 system with just the 2014 tax software loaded.  So, after an hour on Chat, I was told to load the 2013 software, open and resave the prior year tax return and then I should be able to import it into the 2014 tax software.  I did this, and still was not able to import into the 2014.  Making matters worse was the 2013 software also did not &#34;see&#34; my prior year .atx files and I couldn't open the files in the 2013 software either.  So after an hour wait on phone support, the individual was unable to help me out and ultimately, we were disconnected.  I had expected her to call me back as prior to being disconnected, I did confirm that she had my call back number.  Needless to say, after the disconnection, there was no callback and I just could not handle yet another hour on Hold.  So, I went back to the 2013 software -- used  the RESTORE feature and followed the steps below.  Voila, my prior year tax data and ALL my depreciation info hasbeen imported into the 2014 business tax software.<br />Need to load prior year tax software ie. H&R Block 2013<br />Need to RESTORE atx file.  This option is under the “File” tab.<br />Once file restored, need to re-save tax return in H&R Block 2013<br />Then Open current year tax software ie H&R Block 2014.<br />Import the restored saved tax return from H&R Block 2013<br />File should now work in 2014 software.<br />Good Luck
821	1	I have used this software application for  a couple tax years now.  It works great for me.  Entering data is easy.  Finding forms is easy.  Filing is easy.  Those are three major reasons for my review!
822	0	Not too much of a fan really.
823	-1	I have been using Quicken for years.  I had the 2010 version and received a notice from BoA that it would no longer be supported for Downloads so I upgraded.  Unfortunately the downloads for BoA do not work for the one stop updates.  It keeps locking my BoA online ID so I've gone back to downloading it manually again. Very frustrating given the $$ spent.
824	0	Same as every year's addition - not better no worse.  Basic works for all levels of tax if you know how to do federal taxes.  If you don't already know how to do federal taxes then TurboTax (any version) is just OK - you may not complete your taxes correctly if you just follow TurboTax instructions.
825	-1	it could not download 1099 from tdameritrade and gave me some error msg.  The interface is no as clear as Turbo tax.  I'd like to return this but there is no way do it.  I have to buy the Turbo Tax.  Waste of money.
826	-1	avast free is better. and well... free. save your money. bitdefender free is also good.
827	0	I have been using some version of Quicken since 1995 and am happy with the software. However, I am not happy with the fact that Intuit forces you to upgrade the software every 3 years although there is no compelling reason to do so. If you download your bank and credit card transactions, you have no choice but to upgrade because Intuit says that the older version will not support the download any more. This appears to be a business tactic to continue the revenue stream and not for helping the customer or for technical reasons.
828	0	This program is good until you need technical assistance from H&R Block. Twice I had to call their customer service number and on both occasions had to hang up after almost an hour waiting for an available customer service rep. Decided to try the chat option with the same results. Also, I thought the state tax returns included efile for  but I was wrong. The package includes the software to do your state returns but to there is an additional charge to file electronically. I'll take the blame for not reading the small print.
829	0	now some $20/copy cheaper at Costco.  However, finally Turbotax is reaching close to the same quality as those prof. programs as used by Professional Tax preparers. increased questions, increased supervision, good job by Turbotax to reduce errors but still recommend that people with multiple enterprises/high income, multiple issues get professional help.
830	0	After cleaning up the mess of Deluxe not doing what Deluxe use to do, it worked great. Have to admit I am concerned what the correct version will cost next year. I have used and liked TurboTax for over 10 years and have loved it.
831	1	No problems and easy to use. Better than trend micro
832	0	The book has legal samples, but there is no search feature and I found it difficult to navigate.  I could not even find some of the documents it was advertised to include.
833	-1	32bit works fine, but 64bit version is very broken. Had to steal a file from the Pro 64bit version to make it work. Please fix the x64 installer.
834	0	Despite making it sound like it would get me a better refund (it's &#34;deluxe&#34;, after all), it came up with the exact same refund as the free (if you meet certain criteria) online version,  which I ended up using in order to get my South Carolina return eFile for free.<br /><br />I do have a mortgage and other issues, but my deductions didn't beat the standard deduction; moreover, the questions for the free online version seemed just as thorough.
835	1	Have been using Quicken for years.  Basically a good program but have always hated their lack of support.
836	-1	It acts like a virus, constantly popping up and demanding you to register it with no option but to remind later or register now. I'll never buy another Kaspersky product again. As soon as I find a replacement I'll be uninstalling it.
837	-1	I was intimidated by your download software process.  There is no reason for such an involved procedure.  And I was particularly angry that you put the icon for this software, permanently installed on my computer, visible down on the taskbar.
838	0	Very confusing to get this program going.
839	0	its ok not to fan of it
840	1	Excellent program! Use it every year...make it a part of your yearly tax process. Purchasing from Amazon is the best way to go.
841	-1	Ginormous buttons and most features stripped out.  They ruined 13 to make it support the equally lame Windows 8.  So very sad, but hopefully version 14 will reflect the same return to sanity as Windows 10.  But stay away from 13, far, far away.
842	-1	I've been a user of Block since 2002 and have generally been happy with it.  This year, however, the software is only giving me 4 free e-filings despite the fact that they say they give you 5.  I gave up on customer service after waiting over an hour to find out why (I had to do something else).  I'm waiting again (17 minutes so, far and still waiting).  If they do not give me my fifth filing, I will probably pursue them for fraud on the principle of the thing.  Poor service support at any rate.
843	0	alright just takes along time to convert from avi to ipad like overnighters so if that was fixed be pretty good.
844	1	Does a great job with minimal resources. This is my second year with it. See no reason to change.
845	1	Nothing negative about this purchase. Good Value. Will purchase again through amazon. So far, after 1 month, I have had no issues with this software.
846	-1	I was excited when I got this product.  It worked well initially.  However, after 1 month I was having problems with connectivity to online banking.  I went to Quicken support, they told me it was a serious issue and would get back to me in 7-10 days.  They never did.  What a joke and a waste of money.
847	0	good
848	-1	"****UPDATE!!!:<br /><br />This is one botched piece of software. There was an Arizona update tonight. Yay! Sounds like they finally fixed the problem of correctly transposing the numbers from Federal Schedule A to Arizona Schedule A. Nope. Not a chance. This company is fully aware there's a major problem with the Arizona module. They either don't know how to fix it, or they refuse to fix it. How do I know there are numerical errors in H&R Block's software this year? I ran the exact same tax return on 4 other major tax software providers.<br /><br />Again.......the sad reality is that Arizona is broken. Block either doesn't know how to, or won't fix it.<br /><br />Block appears to be inept. For that reason, I strongly recommend you save yourself time, $$$, and lots of grief. Don't buy this useless piece of garbage. It's that simple.<br /><br />Whoever \\""handled\\"" the Arizona module should be the hapless target in a farting contest starring Rosie O'Donnell and Louie Anderson. H&R Block turned this into a completely useless piece of software for me. Just some of the problems I found. I'm sure there are many, many more!!!:<br /><br />1. Software incorrectly imports data from Federal \\""Schedule A\\"" to Arizona \\""Schedule A\\"". I told them about it, by way of phone and chat. No updates. No one has fixed it. How could all the others get it right and H&R Block get it so very wrong? And why do they not jump on fixing broken software? Why would they want to professionally embarrass themselves? Their lack of attention and overt laziness makes me embarrassed for them.<br /><br />2. Critical forms for Arizona are missing (form 321, \\""Credit for Contributions to Charities That Provide Assistance to the Working Poor\\"".) Try getting credit for what you've donated there, without having your return rejected. I dare ya.<br /><br />3. Software was stupidly set up to not recognize the 4th installment of Arizona state estimated taxes, so that when you check for errors, it always comes up as an error.<br /><br />This year for kicks, I ran the same tax return on H&R Block, Turbotax, Taxact, OLT online, and FreeTaxUSA. The cheapest, (at only $9.95 for state) was FreeTaxUSA. Interestingly.......FreeTaxUSA was also the ONLY one that got all the correct forms organized for state. Taxact may have it right too, but I didn't pay for the state result, so I don't know.<br /><br />Here's what I do know:<br /><br />1. H&R Block tax software seems to be supremely screwed up.<br /><br />2. Turbotax is awfully good, but very pricey. If you need to do numerous returns though, it would be the bargain of the bunch when you do the math.<br /><br />3. FreeTaxUSA is the new very, very good and very reasonably priced tax software, at only $9.95 for state, including free e-file for both federal and state. Federal is free. It's the 2nd year I've used it. It's remarkably good, but the $9.95 charge only covers 1 return.<br /><br />4. If you hunt around, you can find a discount price of only $11.90 for Taxact (for 1 return......federal & state, & free federal and state e-file, after you cough up your $11.90. Just Google for that $11.90 price!)Taxact is fairly wonderful. Just as (if not more!) wonderful is FreeTaxUSA. And FreeTaxUSA is about $2 cheaper than Taxact's $11.90 discounted price. This bargain (hidden!) online price is only good for 1 return.<br /><br />5. If you only need Federal and/or you can figure out the state on your own.......FreeTaxUSA and Taxact are both free for federal. Both are excellent. If you don't need the stuff in Taxact's \\""Deluxe\\"" version, then don't buy it. Most folks don't need it. If you need charitiable donation software........go to TurboTax's \\""It's Deductible\\"". It's online, and it's free, folks.<br /><br />It's clear and apparent to me, that this year (actually I've had major challenges with H&R Block's software in the past!) the software seems to have been written by aged chimpanzees smoking large quantities of crack. Really, really powerful crack. Buyer be extremely aware!!! With the glitches, oversights, incorrectly written and allegedly coordinated (but not really!) federal and state programs, I simply could not be more adamant in NOT recommending H&R Block. However.......if you're a masochist and very much enjoy banging your head against a wall.......for you, this would be PERFECT!!!"
849	-1	This was a waste of money, I could not get this to download on my mac.  It kept force closing and when I would try to relaunch it would not work.  Do not recommend.
850	1	Quickbooks Pro is excellent accounting software.
851	0	Not too many new features except your credit score.
852	-1	The promised automatic download of TurboTax Premier with purchase of TurboTax Deluxe for returning customers didn't happen for me.  It's become a huge ordeal to try to get the automatic upgrade from Deluxe to Premier and still I don't have Premier. Intuit, you are going to lose even more customers over last year's debacle because your promise to provide the free upgrade is not working either.
853	0	It´s ok
854	1	Works great with camera raw files, Now if I can figure out all the bells and whistles I think I will like it even more.
855	0	All the same features as before. I really didnt want to upgrade as the 2010 version was fine. But being I was made to, I see no difference other than an irritating SEPARATE ACCOUNT being listed under ACCOUNTS. This was not visible in the 2010 it has no purpose, it doesn't add into Net Worth. So why is it even there? There are some skeletons of accounts past that cannot be zeroed out without deleting every transaction....like 10 years worth. Very stupid.It cannot even be hidden. Why? If you don't download investments or do any online linking, save your money. Do not upgrade.
856	0	So far so good.
857	-1	This product would not load from the computer software library.<br />I purchased a license with three copies and have not been able to utilize any of them.<br />I would like to here back from Amazon to work out a refund or to arrange a purchase of a CD version of this software.
858	-1	"I have been a Quicken user since 2006. I upgraded in 2010 with a few problems but my experience with the 2012 Quicken has been the worst product experience I have EVER had. Other reviewers have detailed some of the problems so I won't beat a \\""dead horse\\"" or, in Quicken's case, a \\""horse that should be dead.\\""<br />Suffice it to say, DO NOT believe the 5 star reviews. Quicken has a total disregard for their customers.  Just try their help chat OR help by phone. The customer service personnel speak heavily accented British english and have varying degrees of ability to  provide customer service.  Truly, I feel sorry for them having to explain such a poor, poor product. DON'T buy Quicken 2012! If you have a previous version DON't upgrade."
859	1	Very pleased with ease of use and constant checks for accuracy.
860	1	I HAVE USED TURBO TAX FOR YEARS AND FIND THAT IT GETS EASIER EACH YEAR.  I LOVE THAT IT AUTOMATICALLY FILLS IN YOUR STORED INFORMATION BEFORE YOU EVEN BEGIN.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT.
861	-1	I bought Tubotax Home and Business 2012 from Amazon, and learned to my dismay that there is a bug in the program that will not let you download and install your state tax files. The only way I finally got mine was to be on hold (2 different people) for about 2 hours.  Then they put a download on my Turbotax.com account so I could manually download it and install it into my copy of Turbotax.<br /><br />This is unspeakably shoddy behavior for a company the size of Intuit, and who has always made good products.  I received little apology from their customer service reps, who make it clear they are aware of the problem but so far have done little to fix it, other than forcing people to be on hold on the telephone for a couple of hours in order to get their copy of the state forms.<br /><br />Of course, they DO allow from within the program the opportunity to buy the state program for another $35  or so, but I was not willing to pay for something that was supposed to be included in the program.  This almost feels like an intentional fraudulent effort to get people to buy the state product over again.<br /><br />Complain loudly so that Intuit takes this bug seriously.  If enough of us write bad reviews, perhaps they will do something really appropriate, like proactively download the correct state to each customer and notify them by email that it is ready.
862	0	Product is Ok and does most of what i needed and expected however compared with many software products on the market today its interface is not very intuitive.  I would actually go as far as saying the 'dual' presentation of graphical and traditional menu based interfaces actually makes the product harder to use.  There is a significant amount of functionality/features you can not get to via the graphical presentation, forcing users to jump between interface styles (Menu/Graphical).<br />From a functionality perspective the only gripe is around sales/use tax. - I was expecting built-in / pre-defined tax tables that could either be automatically updated or easily managed, sadly neither is the case.<br />On the Use Tax side I can not find any functionality that helps track/record use tax liability against purchases. - Being honest this Use Tax 'gap' may be due to me not knowing the product well enough but if such functionality does exist, I cant find it.
863	-1	"I have used H&R Block for 3 years now for our small business taxes as well as our personal taxes.  This year H&R Block does not include an interview for our state, Montana, so I am filling out the forms by hand.  I feel this is blatant false advertising.  It says straight on the box \\""Federal + State\\"" but the difference is the software walks you through Federal and then throws you under the bus for State."
864	-1	Like many of the other reviewers, I'm a longtime TurboTax user. I decided to switch this year for the same reason as everyone else. I downloaded TaxACT, since it was free and had pretty good reviews. Unfortunately, I was unable to import my data from last year's TurboTax PDF. I tried three times, and each time I received the message that the import process was undergoing maintenance. I decided to dump TaxACT and pay the $15 for the Basic version of the H&R Block product, which worked like a charm.
865	-1	I only renew to get transfer of my bank account to my quicken account.<br />I don't use nor have any use for any additional functions yet am annoyed on each revision to have to learn over again to find the functions I do use. For ex I now have to click my right button on my mouse to reconcile an account instead of having it located on the edit function. It is simple enough to do (after by trial and error you find out how) but after using Quicken for at least 15 years it is hard to change. Also you do not list all the changes (only most of the additions) you make from the previous edition.
866	-1	I have the fastest macbook pro available and I have Yosemite.  This program freezes when other applications are open like safari.  I cannot open some links in my emails.  I purchased this so I could help a deaf student in my class.  I will just learn sigh language.  I would not have preferred not to purchase this program.  I do not think that I will ever use it.
867	-1	I have been a devotee of Quicken for over 20 years. While overseas I have not used it. I just purchased the Premium. It is not intuitive, it transfers amounts from account in accurately and it is less elaborate and complete in comparison to the old quicken. The more I worked with it the more frustrating it was.<br />Very disappointing.<br /><br />I am doing financial info on excell.
868	-1	Won't even open now!!!
869	-1	Purchased this product and noticed that computer started to work very slowly and that wifi connections were non existant.  Thought that the problem were the internet providers but when it happened on multiple days in multiple locations realized it was not the issue.  After calling a technician we realized the problem was the download of Norton 360.  Once the program was removed the computer continued to function as it should be.  Don't buy the product until they can fix it  Also, no one at Norton was able or willing to help without paying more money.  Truly a scam company and product
870	0	Item delivered on time, was as described
871	1	This is an awesome product.
872	1	I haven't finished the course yet but so far it's the best language software I have ever used.  No supplemental equipment needed (i.e. books, workbooks, etc...)
873	-1	This not a very good software to use on your computer. It will block almost everything that you try to download on your computer. There is a small chance of allowing software or programs on your computer. Do not buy it.
874	0	"From having visited the Alsatian part of France and being acquainted with native \\""Elsaesser\\"" I might suggest it to be easier to become first fluent in German and then enjoy yourself teasing out of the dialect the words you're familiar with. If I'm not mistaken, Alsatian is a Main, Frankish German dialect sort of like Luxemburgerisch. Natives of the upper Bavarian province of Ober Franken speak a similar dialect.<br /><br />I love Alsace & Lorraine. The food is awesome, the wine flows and the people are warmhearted. Spend a couple of weeks there living amongst the Elsaesser and you will pick up the language.<br /><br />No - I don't own this on line learning aid. If this is what you need to learn Alsatian, by all means buy it."
875	-1	If only some software upstart could produce a customizable, usable product LIKE QB was when it started, not this monolithic blob...
876	0	I bought this for $27.99 and less than 36 hours it went to $23.75! Amazon will not price match their own prices. At least retail stores give us 30 days!!! Not cool at all Amazon!
877	1	My wife's iphone needed a software restore to enable music updates and she wanted to keep her SMS messages, some of which were very important to her for personal reasons.  After taking about 30 screen shots and with hundreds to go I thought there must be a better way and found this software.  It did exactly what I needed quickly, easily and efficiently.  Thank you.  Well worth $9.99!
878	0	I am a carpet cleaner.  So, being able to handle a lot of transactions on the go is awesome.  I have all my customers info with me at all time.  The down side is I've been charged for the add-on stuff like payroll and credit card processing incorrectly.  I never got a refund for one of the charges.
879	1	I upgraded from Quicken Deluxe 1995, which I used religiously, I wanted to upgrade however many of the intervening upgrades had poor reviews. The mobile device aspect of Quicken 2013 was game changer for me with an Ipad and Iphone. Many of the issues with early versions of 2013 have been resolved and I am happy with this release.
880	0	This is a clone of &#34;Muvee Reveal X&#34;. It has 12 movie styles.<br />Easy to use, easy to make good movies for beginners.<br />Original Muvee reveal supports Korean, but It doesn't.<br />If it's corrected, it'll be more suitable for me because native language is more familiar than English.
881	1	Great product, had everything I needed to complete my taxes and few others. Will purchase again for the next tax season
882	-1	Stay away!!! If I was able to give this product no stars I would give it no stars. totally the worst product I've come across. avast used to be great back in the day but like everything else these days they change the product and it sucks! It totally destroyed my computer. first and foremost it destroyed Windows Media Player. I had installed avast in a desktop and a laptop. It slowed everything down to a crawl. when I attempted to uninstall it it took Windows Media Player along with it.!!! on both the desktop and the laptop! I had to go to Microsoft Fix it to repair Windows Media Player on both computers. upon doing a google search I realize that I got off lucky. there were many reports of destruction that was far worse than what I experienced. never again!
883	-1	I purchased this Fed only version.  Upon filing my state taxes the state website was so pitiful they calculated that I owed $1,800. YIKES!  The state website was so pitiful that there was no online help.  So, I paid INTUIT $40 to upgrade include State!  DUMB ME!  THEN INTUIT WANTED AN ADDITIONAL $25 TO E-FILE MY STATE!  ARRG!
884	0	It gives you a free 15-day trial, then you have to supply the registration key to activate the full product on your computer. I'm no software or computer expert, but it seem quite difficult to find out how to get the registration key. But once I did, it works fine (I do like how fast it converts video so uploading to YouTube is a lot quicker than pre-conversion with DSL).<br /><br />Another thing I want to mention, I was originally looking for some video editing software. I was under the impression that this was. However, it only appears to be a video converter. I don't even think it offers any video downloading features -two items I was looking for originally.<br /><br />I ended up using Picasa to do the things this ArcSoft product didn't do.
885	-1	I'm still getting spyware warnings
886	1	Have used Excel for years and find it to be the best spreadsheet software for me. Works well, installed easily.
887	0	this product works just like it is supposed to. however, it is in desperate need of an update to be compatible with the new macbook pro retina display. everything is blurry. its not blurry to the point where i can't use it, just needs a tune up, then it'll be 5 stars.
888	-1	You used to put out a fantastic product, but the last 2 versions have been so poor that I am seriously going to look for another program.  I am truly disappointed. Seems to take me twice as long to pay bills, update files.  You need to NOT rush to get a new product released before you know that it works!
889	1	Love this...makes filing taxes a pixel if cake! Easy to use and straightforward. Excellant for the beginner or expert to use.
890	1	Sucks that we need to use this stuff but alas its the best of the bunch
891	-1	This product disappoints me.  I loved the old version.  The new one is not user-friendly and was more expensive for less product and service.  When we called customer service, it was answered by someone who did not speak English and could not understand the question.  We were put on hold for over an hour.  Finally, the customer rep said he would have a supervisor call us.  No one ever called back.  The new product certainly does not meet the standards of other Quicken products.  I filled out a survey for the Intuit regarding this product.  Of course, I never got a reply.  Ease of use and customer service are certainly not considered in this product.
892	0	Compared to the elegance of modern Mac word processors, Word 2011 is a Frankenstein's monster of cobbled together features and thoughtless user interface design.  But, as much as I like Pages and others, the key word here is 'features', because if it's features you're after, as annoying and clumsy as Word is to use, it does have a depth of features that can't be beat.<br /><br />I've used Word on Macs and PCs for many years, but in the last year or so Pages has been my word processor of choice on Macs.  However, when I come up against something I just can't do in Pages - table cells that flow over more than one page; a document that requires proper numbering - I know that I can switch to Word and do it.<br /><br />But I only switch when I absolutely have to, because the general experience of using Word is not pleasant.  The two main problems are:<br /><br />1.  Annoying, little, but prominent, bugs.  It took me less than 10 minutes of using the 2011 version before I came across one of these.  I set up some styles and wanted to use them in a table.  Every time I tried to switch some text in a table cell to the style I wanted, it would immediately switch back to 'Unknown' style.  I was eventually able to get it to do what I wanted by deleting the table cell and creating a new one.  Not much of a problem - but this is the general experience of using Word - little things that just get in your way.  It never, ever 'just works'.<br /><br />2.  Idiotic user interface decisions.  Most obviously, whether you like the ideas behind the Ribbon or not, its current implementation, from a Mac point of view is just plain idiotic.  Almost 80% of macs sold are MacBooks - with a screen aspect ratio of 16:10.  Having a user interface that stacks great big ribbons and toolbars at the top of the screen while leaving huge quantities of space at the side of the screen is just bad, bad UI design.  And, despite 5 or more years of the ribbon, Microsoft still hasn't given the option of placingthe ribbon on the side.  Again, this is the general experience of using Word - a user interface which actually seems to go out of its way not to give you simple things that would make using it so much easier.<br /><br />(You can turn the ribbon off and use menus or 'toolboxes' - but again you immediately hit another clunker.  The toolboxes can be resized vertically - but not horizontally.  So in the case of the Styles toolbox, you're limited to about 10 characters for a 12pt style name and if a style has a large margin or font, you wont actually be able to read the name at all.  There is no reason why you should not be able to resize these toolboxes - with the screen aspect ratio, there is plenty of horizontal room and Microsoft must actually have turned off the standard window behavior which allows resizing.  Why?  It literally feels like the UI designers are trying to annoy their users.)<br /><br />Again, these issues and the many others may seem like little things, but they're often related to features I use a lot and I'm certain that every user will find a UI decision and/or little bug that just makes using Word an absolute pain.  This is supposed to be a tool that transparently allows you to pour creativity into your document, not into finding new ways to curse at your wretched word processor.<br /><br />So no, if you have any choice in the matter, I would not recommend Word 2011.  However, you can't say Microsoft doesn't pack those features in like its life depended on it.  Which it does.  Because the rest of the pack is catching up, and as soon as they do, it will be my great pleasure never to use Word ever again.
893	-1	Works about the same as Quicken 2007.  I'm not using anything more than what I had in Quicken 2003.      I'm getting tired of the forced upgrades form Quicken.      1.  It is even more insulting that they disabling features on software I purchased (i.e. disabling QIF imports on Quicken 2007) so that I have to upgrade.    2. The search and search-n-replace feature is worst than before.    3. When I do download transactions, Quicken limits how far back.  With another product I'm trying, I was able to get transaction much further back.    There is NOT one new feature of Quicken 2011 that I use with the exception of the automatic transaction download ... and that is because Quicken changed the process in order to charge higher fees to banks.      In the end, Quicken is forcing you/me to pay them every few years for features I don't use or need.
894	0	I started with &#34;Photoshop LE&#34; many, many years ago, and have dutifully upgraded from Adobe with each new release, switching to the Mac version when it became available.  Never any problem with CDs or more recently with downloads.  BUT I haven't been able to get the download from Amazon to work properly
895	1	always good quality products
896	-1	I was very unsatisfied with this purchase. The download wouldn't download right for my outlook. I then had to pay someone else, guru aid, to fix it, because your tech support sucks. I will never, ever use you again. My company, friends, and clients know about my experience with you.
897	1	Excellent.Purchase.  Quicken is dependable and picks up previous entries that interface with versions you may have had for the past several years.
898	1	The Quicken 2015 lives up to its predecessors. It can keep up with your spending and show graphs of categories of spending for up to a year. . It is a good way of keeping up to date with personal finances in an easy to use format. It keeps you on your toes
899	-1	Disappointing.  I came here to look at purchasing an upgraded version of ps. Looks like I'll have look at an alternative.  Im not in the business of renting software.
900	-1	I just dont know why I bought this. It actually slows my computer down. I added more ram and its back to normal speed, but I dont think its doing its job because I had some malware in music file that I never knew about until my buddy uploaded the music into his windows computer and it crashed his whole computer. Obviously this product didnt do anything. My OS protected me and besides. Apple actually cares about its customers and fixes viruses for you when they come up. Waste of money!!! dont buy this.
901	-1	Was unable to download the product.  Could not understand the tech person who was helping.  Returned for refund.
902	1	Comprehensive and intuitive.  Helped me to find an error with last years return as well.  Saved me $$$$$.
903	-1	Some features are better, but most are not.  I miss QuickMath and Reports are not nearly as useful as they are in Quicken 2007.  Can't customize page size, can't easily run a transaction report; trying to change a report period to last year didn't work all of the time.  It's making it very hard to gather information for taxes since it is so different.
904	1	I do some youtube editing and some stop motion work. I had platinum 10 and it lacked a lot of things I needed to sway the illusion of stop motion animation (blur effects, cookie cutter). This does indeed have them, basic versions though which are actually a little touchy at times in terms of appearance, but overall its a bare bones version of a $500 software package in vegas pro, so you get what you pay for here. If you're keeping it basic, its great, but for advanced options its a little limited, but the quality is still good.
905	1	Been using the free version for years and decided it was time to upgrade to premium. This is a steal given 1 year normally costs 24.99. If you're upgrading from a mbam trial or prior annual fee code, you may need to run the mbam cleaner like I did. Also, as others have noted the code and key are in the same code and not broken out separately. Overall, a great product!! Just make sure you setup your normal AV to exclude the mbam folder and .exes otherwise you might have slower performance. Great product overall!!!      Key Not working (or old key appearing)?: Read this --> https://forums.malwarebytes.org/index.php?/topic/122284-mbam-clean-removal-process/    You will likely need to run mbam cleaner to remove all traces of the prior keys and install.    http://downloads.malwarebytes.org/file/mbam_clean    The process above is what solved my key issue as the old key kept appearing..
906	0	I'm not a Quickbooks fan so I am not one to rate QB.  I much prefer SAGE (Peachtree).  Peachtree is so user friendly and has more functionality.
907	1	It work so good in a 1 Gb netbook LENOVO, the perfomance of the netbook is so good and the price is low...
908	-1	I tried using turbotax for the very fist time and 3 hours in to usage, I realized it was not going to work for me as my tax situation was lot mopre complex than what turbotax could handle. To startwith, I bought the product because it had a 60 day money back guarantee. Initially Amazon asked me to send emails to intuit as they are supposed to be issuing the refunds.  I was punted from Amazon customer service to intuit with no response from them. I called intuit and they were drawing a blank about the refund. It took me several calls and I have still not got my $67.51 refund.....Never had this bad an experience on anything that I have ever bought on Amazon. My last resort is going to be to call my creditcard company and call this a bogus transaction.
909	0	Works ok. Needs more institutions to select for automatic downloads. Otherwise the product is ok. Needs more on budgeting. Ok
910	1	The 'Karaoke' setting sucks, but I just need it to slow down songs as I'm learning the guitar. It slows down and speeds up songs without changing pitch... unless you want it to. That's nice for the occasional song that's tuned down a half step of whatever, and I don't want to bother with it.
911	-1	Terrible what Intuit has done! I am switching to a different software.
912	-1	For tax year 2014, I am very disappointed with Turbo Tax.<br />I paid $59.95 for the Deluxe version at Staples and it did not have the necessary forms I needed to complete my return.  I had to download  additional forms at an additional cost of $30.00, making my total cost $89.95.<br />Last year, for tax year 2013, I used the Basic version at a cost of $29.95 and it had everything I needed to file my return.<br />I have used Turbo Tax for several years and have always been satisfied with the product.  I most likely will not use it again.

914	-1	Quicken/Intuit, as we know, holds a monopoly position in the personal financial software market.  So, I didn't have much of a choice.  While I can keep track of most of my investments, property and bank accounts, occasional sporadic errors appear in reports that don't match their own accounts summary on left-most frame.  Plus, the blog is loaded with 'superusers' who would rather criticize inquiries rather than simply give solutions.  I don't dare use the download or smartphone apps since the download apps constantly failed when I tried them before.  They sunset all download apps after about 3 years which is not nice.  Finally, I still us (manually) Microsoft Money 2007 for better reporting and account matching results... being aware that investing costing in MS '07 is not updated for new IRS rules and thus, I have to rely on the otherwise inferior Quicken at year-end.  Too bad for us... and too bad that Microsoft stoped MS Money.
915	0	Well, it is not Quicken for the PC but it does help one keep track of expenditures on credit cards, bank statements. It has several programming glitches that made the 3 star review: it is not straightforward to split a purchase into multiple categories, when you want a new entry you need to do command+N instead of just hitting return, there is no 'reconcile' feature that I could find (anyway one that works like Quicken, and the scheduled transactions feature is a bit 'unsmooth'. But it appears for a Mac user to be the only reasonable choice. Wish Quicken/Intuit would step up to the plate for Mac's.
916	0	The reviews here on Amazon have thoroughly discussed the &#34;switcheroo&#34; that Intuit made of its Turbo Tax Deluxe product this year from prior years. Intuit responded after numerous complaints and corrected its marketing fiasco. Now here we go again. On the software box, it notes that a state e-filing fee is $19.99--but in a footnote to that pricing, in fine print, it notes that the price may increase. Well guess what? On March 20, 2015, in the middle of tax filing season, Intuit increased the state e-filing fee from $19.99 to $24.99 and the only way you know that is immediately before you hit &#34;click&#34; to file your tax return. Surprise, surprise, surprise. Our friends at Intuit continue to &#34;nickel and dime&#34; the customer. Apparently, this mid-tax season price increase is normal--it happened to me last year too, I just did not realize it! Intuit has such a good product but they are trying everything possible to make customers angry at them. The morale of the story is to file early--I just wish Intuit would disclose this business practice on its packaging. The product is 5 stars--the marketing and &#34;truth in pricing&#34; is one star--hence my 3 star review.
917	-1	My windows is acting funny and I cant do a system recovery because I never received a disk. I will NEVER download windows EVER again
918	0	"OK, so I downloaded and tried to install this program on my Windows 7 64-bit OS.  The program H&R Block Premium Home and Business has two components, H&R Block 2011 (this is your personal tax software), the second is the H&R Block Business 2011 (this is your business tax software, i.e. LLC, Corp, etc). I found no problems with H&R Block 2011, but had major problems with H&R Block Business 2011.  Installation errors indicated that OLE2.DLL is not compatible...  When I tried to start H&R Block Business 2011, I could not update or move through the program without it crashing.  After several hours of effort, I finally found a solution. First off, I have to say that H&R Block is EXTREMELY LAZY in how they process installation files. Essentially, I discovered that they placed numerous files (called .ocx files) in the wrong locations, a major flaw in their approach.  First off, go to the directory where the program was installed. Since I am using Windows 7 64-bit, my program was installed in the following directory:  c:\program files(x86)\H&R Block Business 2011\  Note: If you are using a 32-bit version of Windows, it will most likely be under c:\program files\H&R Block Business 2011\  Once you have navigated to the appropriate folder, look for a file called \\""!Tax2011_Errors.log\\""  Open the file with Notepad.exe  This file is critical because it lists all of the problems that H&R Block Business is having during its use.  Mine indicated that files RICHTX32.OCX and MSCOMCTL.OCX were not properly registered. What that means is that the program cannot find them or they do not exist.  I found these programs in C:\Windows\system32 folder. However, this is the wrong location for Windows 7 64-bit. This is not a 64-bit program, H&R Block software is 32-bit, which is completely distinct. These files must be located in the C:\Windows\sysWOW64\ folder.  Simply copy the files from the C:\windows\system32 to the C:\Windows\sysWOW64 folder.  After you have copied the software to the correct folder, you may also need to register or activate these files as well. To do that, you need to open a command prompt (click Start, type cmd in the search field and choose cmd.exe)  at the c:\ type the following  regsvr32.exe c:\windows\sysWOW64\richtx32.ocx  then press enter and wait a couple of seconds and you should see a dialog box that says it was successful  back at the c:\ prompt type the following  regsvr32.exe c:\windows\sysWOW64\mscomctl.ocx  then press enter and wait a couple of seconds and you should see a dialog box that says it was successfull  You should now be able to use H&R Block Business 2011. Remember that the log file will help to identify your problem, and if it is not the one described above, you should be able to dissect the problem.  Good Luck,  James"
919	-1	Crashed in the middle of install.  Crashes on load, when it doesn't crash it asks for a key that was not provided.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!
920	0	It is good, sometimes it tells me there is error , I have to update by my self. also not easy to down load and install .
921	0	At this point (Jan 22, 2015) this product is REALLY buggy. I hope they download fixes. It constantly crashes when I'd be working on accounts and then click on REPORTS in the upper menu. Then it closes down and you have to restart it. Fortunately I have not lost any data input yet.<br />Also, when I run any of the 2 budget reports it comes up with all zeros in the ACTUAL column. The budget it there, no actuals.<br />If you like your existing Quicken, don't waste money on this upgrade. At least not until they fix it.
922	1	Performed mostly as expected.  The questionnaire to determine dependent status for students can be misleading, and prone to error.  I found this out by running my same data on Turbo Tax, and got a different result.  The Turbo Tax questions probed deeper, which leads me to believe that the Turbo Tax result is probably more accurate in this case.
923	-1	I have been a TurboTax customer for many years.  Last year I filed my taxes using the Deluxe version.  My tax circumstances have not changed and I will still file the exact same forms but I'll now have to pay $30 more for the Home and Business edition if I decide to go that way.  That's a pretty big percentage jump in tax prep software.  I appreciate all the negative reviews, I'd been even more irritated had I bought the deluxe edition got part way through and had to pay an upgrade fee.  I've never looked at other products but will before I buy this time around.
924	-1	I just tried to upgrade from Quicken 2012 and the program crashed after my 2012 was removed.  I have been a loyal customer since the beginning.  I have looked at all the reviews and thought that I wouldn't have the same luck.  After all, I have loved the program.  It has served me well until now.  No more.  I am through.  I am not going to go through all the hassles of trying to get this right.  I am sad to move on, but it is time to go.  I can't believe that Intuit has done such a poor job of providing an upgrade.  What a waste of money!
925	1	So far, so good....moved it to a  new computer and everything linked up fine.
926	0	Good product w/o much of learning curve but if you owe state taxes they hit you up fo another $40 :o! which I think is BS!!!!<br />I used Turbo Tax last year and it was great but got a bad write ups in this years reviews. I may go back to them next year depending on next years reviews....<br />G
927	1	I have used their Products for years and would never use another Converting suite it is very reliable. While other people may have had small issues, they have always provided me with good support this is why, I just don't use any other software they keep up with the latest Devices on the market and their upgrades are always great and speed has improved over the years .They are always happy to hear feed back or how they can improve on their product.<br />I have been using this product for a few years now, and I am very happy.
928	0	An over the top program that tries to do everything for anybody; that is, unless you want to do a simple capital gain on a stock. This simple feature present in the past is gone, meanwhile all sorts of other 'not common' options are dealt with.  New this year, you have to enter all medical, even HSA paid items, and then the magnificent program deducts the HSA re-Imbursement. Why? It's method of dealing with HSA deposits keeps getting more convoluted; if I already checked no, why does it still run me through all the question instead of letting me move on to my spouse's yes? No is no.
929	-1	Did not work at all i am getting my money back
930	0	Easy to use.  However, the included State return module required an additional fee to file!  Seems like they would indicate this on the package.
931	1	I like this program for doing our yearly holiday letters.  It is easy to use and has many formats to choose from.
932	0	Good start!
933	-1	Its got to many pop up ads. I know its free but its supposed to stop pop ups and viruses. Instead it has it's own pop ups trying to get you to buy the paid version.
934	0	I have used Quicken for a number of years but several years back they changed the entry. It was a drop down screen that you entered data and assigned it tot the account now well it is a table form that does not come up as full screen on my computer unless I add step to full screen. also the accounts come up off the edge of the screen and I need to re center them.
935	1	The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is that it would be nice to have some options on a simplier Will requirement. Like a quick questionaire in the software then it suggests som versions to use. Besides that it does a great job of stepping through the Will making process and made me think quite a bit on what I wanted to write. It also identified some area's that I had not considered adding to my will and now I am.
936	1	Very good. A bit pricy but worth it in the end.
937	-1	Even a Microsoft chat agent couldn't help me.  The product won't give necessary codes or allow online registration. I spent about $359 for a product that will end a week from now, and even Microsoft can't help me.  HUGE rip off!!!!
938	0	They really need to NOT try to make a buck off their bread and butter. We give them a ton of money for not much work on their end. Do not remove the forms that have always been included!
939	-1	I just returned home with yet another computer that went belly up due to a Norton antivirus program.  This is the third computer I've had to uninstall Norton.  The computer repair person who repaired this computer advised me to never use Norton, it is full of bugs and problems, and that was the first thing he eliminated.  I uninstalled it on a computer before, and the problems ended.  The second one was uninstalled by a computer repair person, who advised me of the same problems with Norton, and apparently Norton will affect many other programs on your computer.  It seems to act like a virus instead of preventing a virus.  It has great abilities to destroy a computer in a number of ways.  Anyway, according to the computer person, if you have Microsoft, it provides its own antivirus abilities that works better than purchasing a program.  It's called Microsoft Essentials.  It's maintenance free and provides the security you need without these costly and highly ineffective virus programs that have the ability to reak havoc on a computer.  This last go-around every program had to be eliminated on my computer, and so I have a shell that I now have to recreate and load all programs again.  It was a MESS!  Just a heads-up.  I'm sure there are a few folks out there who have had pretty good success with Norton, but if you start to experience problems, unable to bring up programs, unbelievably slow responses and programs you cannot pull up anymore no matter what you do, it could possibly be Norton and you might try uninstalling that first.  You would think I would have learned a lesson the first time. But the HP computers I bought in 2010 already came loaded with Norton for two years.  An uninstall on that would have saved me a lot of problems and money.
940	-1	For me, it was a waste of money...don't see any real improvements.
941	1	Saw number of negative reviews from folks having issues with install.  I had no problems whatsoever and happy with price paid.
942	1	I am so happy to be able to edit my previous comments and continue with my long-time 5-star rating of Norton Internet Security. I might have unfairly judged Norton during the Windows 10 upgrades. Since then, I have been able to access the chat quite readily for the family laptops and all issues were quickly resolved. This version also includes &#34;Performance&#34; in addition to Security and Identity and I am grateful to Norton for helping solve a performance issue with one of the laptops. This feature also assists in clearing up unnecessary files. We will definitely be renewing with Norton!
943	0	I've been using the full Photoshop version and finding the tools is not easy.  It's a dumbed down version to make it easier for dummies I guess.  The photo merge works great though.  Tools all work great if you can find them.
944	-1	Don't really like this. It's simple yet complex.
945	0	First time Turbo Tax user (I've previously filled out my own tax forms).  It was actually pretty easy to use. The only thing that really miffed me is that when I got all the way through preparing my federal and &#34;included&#34; one state tax, I found when I went to e-file I had to pay another 29.99 to file my state taxes. Hard to swallow when I know I can free file. Next year I will use Turbo tax again for fed because I have investments and rental property, but will file my taxes electronically directly with the state because it's free and easy.  It's not so much the charge (still cheaper than hiring a CPA), just the fact that it felt like a &#34;hidden charge&#34; that irked me.
946	0	I didn't know I had to renew this subscription after 1 year from purchase. I am disappointed in the software I had to do factory recoveries 3 times since using this software due to viruses/malware.
947	-1	I have purchased Quicken for several years in a row and have never found it to be user friendly but since my data  is all there I have put up with it. the 2014 version is the worst version yet and the mobile app is a joke.  I can't download transactions from some of my accounts since I updated to this new version and I cannot get my balances in Quicken to match with the banks. I now have the motivation to try another program.
948	1	So far, so good.
949	1	As expected!
950	0	I like it
951	1	First time user. Everything I was told about the turbo tax is true. Very simple to use, gets you the max return you deserve. I will continue to use it and have already recommended it to my friends.
952	1	Use it year after year
953	0	I normally buy an upgrade every few years but was upset to be forced to do it this time.  And, after using 2013 for a few weeks, I would be perfectly comfortable staying with 2010 if they weren't disabling the banking/financial download capability.<br />The conversion process itself was seamless & all my data appears to be in order in the new version.  It took some tweaking to get the screens to appear in a manner I like.  Bottom line, it appears to work fine but I'm ticked that I had to pay more just to keep on doing what I have been successfully doing for years.
954	0	Sorry, i bought this by accident.. NO PC here.. only MAC here.. this probably a great product, but no PC HERE...
955	0	i found that i have til dec. left on the norton product i bought last year.  i wish i had waited to buy when my old one expired.  too bad amazon did not have a way to tell me this. i found out by going to norton when i had trouble getting it to download. i am assuming i will be able to download this one when my old one expires in dec.
956	0	My laptop did start working properly. Even the Trojans I could not delete have been guaranteed pretty well. Too bad it only last a year.
957	1	Great software!  It replaced an older version I had and it's easy to use and gets the job done!
958	-1	"I must echo all the other people who have given this product 1 star.  It is \\""buggy\\"".  It routinely crashes on opening.  It is common for me to start it at least 3 times before it will stay up and running.  Then there are the times for whatever the reason it will refuse to run a \\"".OFX\\"" update.  I am not happy that I upgraded.  I at least backed up my 2012 version, so if I decide to revert, I can.  Oh, and I am talking R12 release here..."
959	0	Not as great as I hope it would be.  When transferring to dvd the quality was not that great.  It just descent.
960	1	PaintShop is a good all around image editing software.<br />It may not stand up to Photoshop, but for the price...
961	1	Love being able to work on both. Haven't used it extensively yet but have worked with Corel in the past and like it.
962	1	Easiest professional software I've ever used, period.
963	1	Been using it for 5 years with no problems, Doesn't cost an arm or a leg like the other Antivirus Programs out there and it works great!!!
964	-1	I've used McAfee for years. After I updated my some software from a reputable company. I started getting lot's of unexpected and completely unwanted pop up Windows. From you have a virus to congratulations you won something from the site I was trying to get to.<br />McAfee virus scans showed no problems. The same with their online tool.<br /><br />I called McAfee about an open case and was told that virus programs are unavoidable. But if I was willing to pay $79.95 and wait an hour they could get someone from McAfee to help me with my problem. My current license expires in a couple months so I deleted McAfee.<br />Checked three other antivirus programs and they all saw the problem.<br />Before deleting McAfee I tried to uninstall the program and McAfee would quarantine the uninstall program program stating it had a virus...funny that after trying to uninstall that McAfee saw the problem...But even then McAfee would not remove the virus.
965	-1	I upgraded from Quicken 2013 to 2015 more or less because they force you or some online services things don't work anymore.  I find 2015 to have  a very buggy user interface.  In the Bill Pay section you have to click enter twice or it will not take. In the register, you have to click the check number field to once to get the drop down arrow to appear to do anything.  After adding an attachment to a transaction, if you don't click enter button on the screen instead of pressing the enter key, the whole thing fails.  I could go on and on.  2013 had a solid interface and i regret upgrading.
966	-1	I have ongoing issues with Quickbooks, and once again I'm finding myself being forced into upgrading early.<br /><br />This latest update came because, during tax time, my accountant took a 2014 version of my company file and tried to send it back to me as a 2015 edition. Unfortunately he had to convert the file to 2015 to read it at all, which made it incompatible with my 2014 version.<br /><br />Beyond that, I don't really see any discernible difference between 2014 and 2015. Quickbooks still crashes every time I try to email or print anything, and it's still draining system resources even when closed. They could at least put some effort into fixing previous versions, at least then I'd actually get an upgrade out of upgrading.<br /><br />I do not enjoy these forced updates,
967	1	This is a great free antivirus software.  There are a few ads but that is to be expected with a free product.
968	1	Avast is the best free protection out there.  It does not slow the computer down and does not effect any other programs.
969	1	good use.<br />not require too much computer resources.<br />and it's free.<br />I recommended this for everyone with personal daily use
970	1	Got a new computer which was not compatable with the old version of quicken.  Got the new one.<br />It was good because it does not have that many changes in it so was able to just pick up.
971	1	This is a functional program as is traditional from Microsoft.  The lack of powerpoint is a bit of a downer when considering the functionality of a student program.
972	0	It was amazing
973	1	After reading about Intuit's 2014 TurboTax Deluxe debacle, I hesitated to get this product. The cost of TurboTax products has done nothing but go up, up, up, and the early release of Deluxe 2014 was definitely a low blow. However, I've used TurboTax since floppy disc days and didn't want to start over again with another tax program this year, so I took the &#34;easy&#34; way out  and stuck with what I've been using. After reading other comments by other long-time users of TurboTax about how easy it was to switch to a different software provider, I just need to make the switch next tax season. Sure Intuit &#34;made right&#34; on Deluxe 2014, but it was only after a massive hue-and-cry from users who felt cheated, and rightly so. I'm loyal but not stupid. I recognize a flim-flam when I see one.
974	1	Norton is one of if not the best antivirus programs!
975	0	It is a good improvement over QB for Mac 2012.  I am glad I bought it.<br />So far no bad surprises.
976	-1	Super slow connection speeds. I get 300+ Mbps on my ISP. When I connect to PIA, I get less than 10! I've tweaked all my settings and followed online guides. No prevail. Would not recommend and would not buy again.
977	-1	I have used Turbo Tax the last several years with no problems. This years experience has been horrible. First and foremost, I don't remember having to pay $20 to E-file State before (at least not the first one). That was a huge additional expense relative to the software price. Also, I have come across many glitches and had to call tech support. He was an idiot and knew absolutely nothing about the product or the process. What little he did tell me was wrong. I don't think I could recommend this product anymore...no longer impressed with it.
978	0	Too many popups in the new version but it's free. It works better than most. Microsoft has built-in antivirus software for Windows 8/8.1 but I still prefer Avast. It keeps my computer fast and clean so it doesn't affect my games, etc.
979	0	My biggest complaint is that e-file costs extra ($17.99).  Also, seemed to create an error in assigning last year's state refund as taxable in the calculations despite it deciding that last year's state refund was not a taxable income because of alternative minimum tax.    Contrary to what others have said it does do schedule C (at least basic sched C - profit/loss from business).
980	0	Federal was just as expected, but disappointed that State E-file is not included.  It had been included in past years.
981	-1	I have this product and yet got a virus on my computer. I had to spend $99.99 to Norton to get rid of a virus that they already knew was a problem. I resent having to spend this money when I had a supposedly had a product which is not being kept up to date. They got rid of the virus and yet did not refund the money to me.<br /><br />It is a rip off and I will look for another product which can stop all problems before I have to spend additional money to fix it.
982	0	Makes computer slow
983	0	The software works great but the record starting time is to much of a delay. You first have a 3 second count down then there is another 5 second delay before it starts recording.
984	0	DESCRIPTION:  After reading that TTax Deluxe had finally (and belatedly) restored its former functionality, I decided to give it a try.  At first it seemed to be OK, even though one of our returns had a Schedule C (imported from last year's TTax Deluxe, which did everything we needed).  This year's TTax Deluxe asked for the associated 1099-Misc (Schedule C) information, but, to my consternation, it never presented a menu for business deductions.  So, not surprisingly, when I ran the Federal Review, the program discovered eleven errors, and when I asked TTax to correct them, it took me to various forms and asked for information to be entered there directly.  No &#34;step-by-step&#34; was available at that point.  Apparently the dumbed-down version was still operating.  I then ran the Federal Review again, and the return passed the test.  But when I went back to take a second look at the Schedule C information, TTax indicated that an upgrade to &#34;Home and Business&#34; was needed.  I elected that option, and the upgrade was applied gratis.  At that point, however, TTax indicated that many of previously-completed sections of the return needed to be reviewed.  I went through all of those sections, and there was nothing wrong with any of them, so it's unclear to me why they needed to be reviewed.  ANALYSIS:  Once Intuit acknowledged that complaints about the dumbing down of TTax Deluxe were justified, the company should simply have restored the missing forms to the Deluxe version.  Instead, they relied on user savvy to request the necessary upgrade, and the upgrade didn't apply seamlessly; instead, it introduced further complexities.  I can well imagine that many people were flummoxed by Intuit's method of restoring previous functionality to TTax Deluxe.  According to the Welcome screen, I'm now running TTax Home and Business, not Deluxe.  BOTTOM LINE:  So, I'm left with a couple of questions.  (1) Will next year's TTax Deluxe include the forms that were eliminated this year?  (2) If the answer to (1) is affirmative, will tax data from &#34;higher&#34; versions of TTax (Premier, Home and Business) import seamlessly into Deluxe next year, so I won't have to go through various user-initiated steps in order to get the Deluxe version to work without further hassles?
985	-1	They ruined it. I have been a user of Visio since 1998 and have always loved it, until now.<br />2013 should not be called visio.
986	1	I do not have a head for taxes.  This program has all that is required to file income tax forms.  We chose to e-file both federal and state forms. Confirmations of filings were received within hours.<br /><br />We have used TurboTax for the last 2 years and when we began the process this year, the program gave us all our data from last year paralleling the entries we would make this year.<br /><br />Every thing went fine.
987	1	Although Norton 360 is noted for slowing a computer down, I attribute my computer's response to be based upon its age and components rather than the product. For what I basically use my computer for though and my available funds, this is the best use of my funds for the value and safety I receive.
988	-1	Get what you pay for.  I have used TurboTax over 10 years, from deluxe to premium.  This version wants an additional 40.00 to allow me to figure my State taxes!  All other versions I purchased in the past came with &#34;1 free State&#34;.  I would have been better off buying the 59.00 version which comes with the State taxes.  Now 80.00 total.  Beware, don't make the mistake I did.  Question.  Who files Fed taxes and not State?  Definitely not a bargain.
989	-1	It appears that the product key sent to me has already been used and the support person was to call me back in an hour and he forgot. Tying to find the  support number is a real trip... I have a case number but so what.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that I need this program to interact with my work... or I'd pack it in and cancel the order.  LOUSY LOUSY expreience for sure.
990	-1	Quicken is easily the buggiest software I own.  It crashes, freezes for long periods, takes forever to refresh, sometimes refuses to un-minimize, and acts as though it is too powerful for my desktop computer.<br /><br />It has password issues, requires patches...<br /><br />However, it does help me budget.
991	1	It's free!!  It's easy to use and has everything a person could need.  Did I mention it's free!!  Download open office!
992	1	All you need, full scann, firewall and auto update for importat software on your computer. Bought this a couple of months ago, best antvirus program i've tried yet.
993	1	The coverage of tax form instructions was thorough yet easy to follow. It saved me the time it takes to leaf through many pages of text reading the ins and outs, branching to many unnecessary pages and forms. It helped me carry out this process of elimination in short order. I concentrated on only what was pertinent to my circumstances. Excellent!
994	0	seem to do a good job
995	-1	I had to puchase Premier ,Turbo Tax to be able to accept K-1 information from LLC's, Partnerships, and S-Corps.  I could not not get a definitive answer from Turbo Tax before I bought the Deluxe.  I telephoned and still had a problem as to how much Premier would handke the K-1 information.  I cannot track&#34; basis&#34; automatically.
996	0	I have used Photoshop Elements for a long time and have enjoyed the product. I use it with Lightroom and get along fine with the combination. I am dissapointed in Elements 10 because of the changes in administration procedures that have been introduced. Adobe is reminding me of dealing with Angela Merkel. I now have to have a password to use my software. When I try to update the Browser the download fails.
997	1	This was my first year of doing our taxes and turbo tax was a very good tool to use.  It walked me through the maze as I struggled.  Finally...success.
998	1	I would recommend this product to anyone who is concerned about computer security.  Avast gives us peace of mind in the knowledge that our computer security is not compromised and that we have little if anything to be concerned about regarding breaches of information.
999	0	Although the photo and movie capture work, I was disappointed to find videos need to be running for the capture to work: one cannot pause at the place they wish to begin recording, but rather need to press record while the video is playing. Not so easily done right the first time.
1000	1	Bitdefender Total Security is the best antivirus software on the market. I have used it for over two years and look forward to a new version every year. The software is great at deleting Facebook trojans found in links, such as the one changing colors for Facebook, and others. It also catches viruses before they destroy the computer. I have been on the internet, one kind or another, since 1979, and Bitdefender is the best antivirus I have found. I recommend this product to anyone who wants above average protection for their computers.
1001	0	Product is easy to use. Nice features. Would recommend it to other needing this type of software. Would given it a better rating if the interface mimicked Photoshop  Why have to learn a new interface?
1002	-1	I have used various versions of the H&R Block tax cut software in the past (mostly because it's the cheapest way to efile). Because I sold my old house, bought a new one, and had some other complications I bought the &#34;Premium&#34; version thinking that it would help me with some of the complications. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />- The &#34;interview&#34; did not fill in some of the forms correctly the first time through, making me go back to adjust them.<br />- The &#34;interview&#34; did not take in to account the buy and sale date of my homes. If I hadn't have researched the law, I would have claimed more of my property tax costs than is allowed.<br />- It doesn't tell you until the end that it will charge you extra if you want to eFile your state taxes.<br />- The Ohio Tax department's own eFile web site is easier to use.<br /><br />Don't buy this version and if you use any version of the H&R Tax software, make sure you know the tax law. Don't count on it to.
1003	0	Good way to capture streaming video, but the need to set the audio input and then not hear the audio makes this less than ideal, tho I haven't found a better solution.
1004	0	During the purchase, I failed to see, or it wasn't noted that it was the 'Old Version'.  I had used the 'trial' version through PhotoShop prior, so upon loading the purchase from Amazon, the tutorials and visual aids don't match and it makes it very hard to learn the program functions.
1005	0	The digital download worked fine.  Maps took just over an hour to update.  However, traveling in NJ, PA, and CO, the maps didn't lead us to the right place.  For instance, clicking on a Costco in NJ led us to a gravel road in the middle of a forest with no Costco in sight.  It happened again in downtown Philadelphia and in a couple of places in Colorado.  Overall though, I did notice updates to newly developed shopping areas, etc.
1006	-1	As a fan of Quicken I was very disappointed that the newer version of Quicken for Mac was simply essentials. It couldn't keep up with the business needs as it had successfully done in the past. So I had to purchase Quickbooks. When transferring my files from Quicken to QuickBooks my files corrupted. Data was lost. Very frustrating. It should have been seamless. Now I am hearing other horror stories about QuickBooks 2013 for Mac. The Mac platform isn't going away. Intuit, support your Mac versions. Make them behave exactly like the PC version so our CPAs don't spend time trying to figure out the differences in the program and can do what they do best.
1007	-1	"UPDATE:<br /><br />I wrote the review below originally, but after using this for a month or so, the software is so buggy that it is actually next-to-impossible to use.  It crashes regularly.  There are a ton of video and formatting bugs.  There was little thought put into the User Experience, as noted below.  The budget amounts change on their own based on the previous spending (rather than what you set).  And it is *way* too easy to accidentally click on something you had not expected to and change it with no confirmation.<br /><br />The software, simply put, is a mess.<br /><br />If I thought I had another option, I would take it (and I will be searching).  For now, I will stumble through a very poorly thought out software design and one that clearly did not have enough time for rigorous Quality Assurance Testing.<br /><br />FIRST REVIEW<br />The software has certainly been helpful in making a budget and tracking transactions.  I would like to be able to easily go from the budget view to a filter of all the transactions in the transaction view.  For example, one of the \\""Entertainment\\"" transactions may be mis-categorized and I want to change it - there is not a link to that line item transaction to be able to re-categorize it.<br /><br />The software also crashes on a reasonably regular basis, and I have had to completely wipe out one bank account and re-add it to get the new password to work.  These are just bugs.  It has not lost data (or I would rank it lower).  This is an inconvenience, but I can live with it for now.<br /><br />All in all, the software is ok, but not solid and some of the features are not integrated intuitively with other features.  If there were an alternative for the money, I would go there, but frankly I suspect there is not so I will hunker down and hope for a patch release."
1008	1	Almost free, works great, love it, easy instructions.<br />Good price, easy installation, all good and great.<br />Have a nice day.
1009	0	We got the new software automatically because we had to purchase a new computer when our our hard drive died.  We use our computer only for a few programs and are novices when it comes to new uses.  We do not really need all the games, music, and other add-ons.  Therefore, the new desktop and all the colorful icons only serve to annoy us.  Loading everything and trying to determine if any of the additional options were worth using took way too long.  Too bad there isn't an option that allows the user to select just what he needs before all the other stuff comes up on the screen.  I did get my email, banking links, Word and Excel onto the task bar, so we can function.
1010	-1	This product sucks. It will not download a single transaction. Too bad I can't get my money back!
1011	0	I have used this product for at least the last ten years to file my taxes. I have always thought of the product as way too expensive. This year, however was less at the time I purchased. A month later, the cost has now risen. Bastards!!! The cost was much more reasonable and I got one electronic filing for federal and I thought one for state. As it turns out, I had to pay $19.99 to electonically file my state tax. The product is very easy to use and makes complicated taxes easier to get thru. Now if the internet security is safe with this product, If I did not have to pay to efile my state return, I would be very happy. If the cost was $60 and included 2 free electonic filings (one fed and one state) I would have rated it 5 stars. Sumary; its cost is still too high.
1012	-1	I have been using Turbo Tax for about 20 years or more and this is the worse product they have ever produced. I had problems with using the program and tried all day long for two days and could not get in touch with anyone.  I finally gave up and sent my taxes without answers to my  questions.  Next year I will use a different program.
1013	0	"The main reason I upgraded to V2013 from my reliable v2010 was the notice from Quicken that later this year my v2010 would not be able to connect online to access my electronic investment data. They say you only have access to online banking for the current version of Quicken and the immediate two previous versions.<br /><br />I have been using v2013 for several weeks now and I certainly don't see many significant improvements. In fact, there are more irritants than improvements. e.g., The column headers in the Portfolio view of my Investments tab do not word-wrap and so I must widen each one to view the header, which makes columns \\""run off\\"" my display screen. Another e.g., is that my v2010 allowed me to enter a spending category by typing a few letters of the category and sub-category, then pressing \\""/\\"" to add a tag. In v2013 I have to enter the spending category/subcategory completely, then \\""tab\\"" to the tag box to enter the tag.<br /><br />In short, I am not happy that I was forced to spend $$ to upgrade to v2013 when it appears that there are few, if any, significant improvements."
1014	0	No comment.
1015	0	Not as easy to use as earlier versions...stupid charms of microsoft...cant they just make things EASY?...do not bet on it!
1016	1	the software was easy to install.  it made the process of purchasing easier than going to the store.  I really enjoy the whole process.
1017	0	I am not sure exactly when Rootkit scans are scheduled, or quick scans, or full scans or any other type of scan.  I want this to scan when I tell it to, not when it thinks I need to.  With Windows 7 and Microsoft Security Essentials, I could say &#34;Do a full scan Sunday night at 10:00pm&#34; and that is what would happen.  I was virus-free and my computer slept most of the time without waking randomly.  With this thing running on Windows 8.1, I'm not sure??? So many types of scans, I have it scheduled to run 1 full scan once a week but I am still not sure why / when these rootkit scans and quick scans are occurring.  I want my computer to sleep when I want it to sleep.  That means not waking up and wasting electricity once I have turned my back. I know Windows 8.1 has issues with sleep and Kaspersky is much better letting the computer sleep than the Microsoft Security Essentials bundled in with Windows 8.1.  Microsoft in their wisdom took away the ability to schedule scans from the MSE package, leaving it up to you to tell it when to scan and how to scan using task manager.<br /><br />Still, the product is performing root kit scans and &#34;quick&#34; scans when it chooses, not when I choose.  I have weird issues when the computer wakes up, like no internet connection available.  I am not sure this is Kaspersky or not, though, to be fair.<br /><br />I like this better than the embedded Microsoft Security Essentials in Windows 8.1 (but I liked MSE in Windows 7.0 because you could schedule it to run when you wanted.)  I'm not entirely sure of this product and I may have a misunderstanding of how it is working.  All I am sure of is these weird problems with internet not being available after waking.  Kaspersky has a good name.  I'm sure Windows 8.1 is not helping my review of this product.  I do feel secure in that there are no viruses / malware lurking on my machine with this running.
1018	0	Disappointing. Every upgrade I've installed--from 9 to 11 to 13--seems a little worse than the last.  Some new features I don't use & some degradation in the user interface. With Mac OSX Mavericks I had a lot of trouble saving files in PSE11 with my MacBook plugged into the big screen Display. The dialog appears with the name of the file off the top of the screen, so I can't put in a new name. If I just hit save to overwrite, the &#34;really overwrite?&#34; dialog appears somewhere off-screen as well, and I had to kill the program. Unfortunately, PSE13 has exactly the same problem.  Also, the crop tool now pops up its suggestions for crops, which covers up part of the image so I can't finish making the crop I intended to make until I cancel and collapse the parameter dialog. Also the Recompose tool seems completely unworkable if you care what size the end result will be. Printing controls are still as confusing as ever.  Sigh.<br /><br />PSE has everything I need, and far more that I don't need.
1019	-1	My husband is Vietnamese and I was hoping to be able to connect with his family better by speaking the same language ( by learning through Rosetta stone). My first less-than-favorable experience was the initial download which took forever and required nearly 30 minutes worth of online registration, which, seems to expire after one year. After this, I went through the usual hear/speak portion of Rosetta stone ( I've used Rosetta stone to improve my Spanish and my French, so I actually enjoy this aspect of the program) However, after trying to use what I learned I went to speak with my in-laws who said that my accent was not easy to understand. After I had them listen to bits of the Vietnamese on the program, they said that the program wasn't teaching proper pronunciation ( which is vital when it comes to languages like Vietnamese). Frustrated, I downloaded a trial of the Pimsleur program for the Vietnamese language which helped a lot and now I’m able to communicate (in a proper accent). Rosetta stone is great, jus not for this language.
1020	1	Product is classic for word processing.  There are a few things which make formatting templates painful but otherwise good.  Also used by everybody.
1021	1	I had a coupon to get this for free, but my daughter is only 3, so we're saving it for later.  Unable to give a good review.
1022	0	Ouch
1023	1	Best way to buy,bought online,This edition is good for most people ,includes deductions&you can send up to 5 returns electronically.Would recommend Was good  value for a download.
1024	-1	Even though the description of the software says it will work with Windows 8, it will NOT work on Windows 8.1. I believe this is because the developers hard-coded it into the setup system. The kernel for Windows 8.1 is not that different from 8.0. Regardless, if you have Windows 8.1 don't get this. It would be nice if the product description stated this since 8.1 is not a new version of windows but a minor upgrade.  Also, I could not uninstall the program. The drivers that they installed will not uninstall and are stuck in use by the OS. POS software from a POS company.
1025	1	I edit video for YouTube and it suits those needs perfectly. It is very to use because of its simplicity and can be complex enough for those who need it.
1026	-1	The desktop client has none of the functionality you should expect from a modern cloud drive client.<br />- You have no control over where your files upload<br />- You can't see the files you uploaded<br />- You can't organize files you've uploaded<br />- You can't see any existing files and folders<br />- Your files do not appear as a drive in Explorer/Finder<br /><br />Both NetDrive and ExpanDrive are adding support for Amazon Cloud Drive, and should be done &#34;soon.&#34;  Pay the money and get one of them; I've used both and they are both fine pieces of software with almost identical feature sets.
1027	-1	And, since Amazon doesn't allow returns on downloaded software, you are better off ordering it directly from Intuit's website (lesson learned), where they will give you a refund. I don't think I'll ever buy software from Amazon again.
1028	-1	Been a Deluxe user since the DOS days. Never again. Not even a schedule D?! Ridiculous!<br /><br />Despite the obvious money grab, the inconvenience this creates is unforgivable. This cynical ploy on their existing user base is the dumbest marketing move in recent memory. Screw them and their $25 rebate. Sasan Goodarzi should be marched form Intuit's premises.
1029	1	Avast has saved me on more than one occasion from new or known bugs. I would not use any other means for protecting my system.
1030	0	My PC of 7 years finally quite on me and I went to the friendly ecosystem of Apple.  I have used Quicken since 2008 on a Windows based platform and I was using the 2011 version before using the Mac version.  I am disappointed on how unfriendly this software is.  There is an extra step or two in order to record a transaction and I can't figure out how to record a check number that I use to pay the landscaper or my pest control guy.  Ultimately it does it job, but I'm comparing it to my PC version and it just isn't up to par.
1031	1	Easy download and works well on my newer Dell desktop (Windows 7) and an older Dell laptop (XP).<br /> This product has very good reviews and this was the least expensive place to purchase.
1032	1	Perfected,
1033	0	tried to down grade from premier to pro and found it not to be as good. not an easy item to return. make sure you really want pro. intuit CS is not what they say and amazon can only tell you where to go.
1034	-1	A terrible program compared with what they used to make.  I had every year from 2005 to 2009 and they were all great very useful tools, but this one stinks.  It is barely usable at all.
1035	1	I have used Avast Internet Security for the past three years and it has produced the security I need for surfing the Internet as well as shopping and doing online banking transactions. I feel secure on the Internet knowing this product is working in the background helping to keep my Internet use as safe as it can be.
1036	1	works great
1037	-1	Did not work for me and we went back to McAfee.
1038	1	Used Deluxe for my 2014 Federal and NJ tax returns. Had regular wages, pension income, interest, stock dividends, and two small businesses to file. I had no problems with the software doing this. I have received my refunds. I would purchase this product again (depending on price).  I want to add that the corporate officers who priced this product showed a complete lack of understanding of their customers. I think they went to the same school as the officers who control Netflix and New Coke, etc.
1039	1	I have been using free avast for for about10 years without a problem.<br />I knew someone who owned a cyber cafe many years ago and he recommended it to me because he used it without infections on all his public computers.<br />It's great!
1040	-1	I returned Anti Virus,after installing my computer did not run properly,removed it and it was ok.
1041	1	excellent product...nice to see a product that is useful but doesn't gouge like Microsoft....because we all know THEY DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY...HA!  LibreOffice is excellent.
1042	-1	As a user of Quicken Windows for well over ten years, I can tell you that this product is horrible. Rather than list the dozens of ways it's inferior, just trust that it will take extra keystrokes to do anything, and many features are just plain AWOL. I've given up managing my investments on Quicken and just use it to balance my checking account and credit cards, and even there it sucks. The reconciliation process is infuriating, and it takes multiple clicks just to enter a transaction. Making a payment has extra fields for no good reason. And when I went to delete all of the securities from my account since I gave up on them, it won't let me. Even worse, it insists on updating their prices, which takes forever, and there's no way to turn it off. I'm desperately seeking an alternative, but QuickBooks for Mac, which I also use for my business, is awful, too.
1043	-1	Biggest waste of money. Product is garbage! I bought this to create DVDs for my sons all star team for end of year party. Spent few hours building DVD only to burn it and then load it on DVD player ...the buttons don't work and you can even play the thing. I had started this Thursday and I had to get DVD done by the party on Sunday and I tried to contact their customer support but had to wait 48 hours to get an email response which I got a response 3 days later today Monday... and that was utterly useless support reply. I am a network engineer and very tech savvy. I found a different program by Coral DVD Movie Factory Pro 7 which was fantastic and worked fine with no problems. I asked for a refund and was told I could not get one but I could get a similar crap product for same value instead.
1044	1	This antivirus protection has stopped so many things from getting into my computer. Seems like daily it is just protecting my system from viruses, malware and other garbage. I will not change from this protection. Thank you so much.
1045	1	So far so good, very simple process for the last two years with TurboTax. So much more cost beffective verses previous returns with accountant tax services.  I would recommend this produst highly although this deluxe version is good for the more simple tax returns, I cannot comment on the more advance versions.
1046	-1	After having no luck with Diamond VC500 One Touch Video Capture Device which would not load on my Win 8 laptop . . . I tried this product. DO NOT TRY IT . . . I had trouble getting the activation code to stick and then it would not recognize any of my input devices. There is basically NO support - you cannot chat online, you cannot call - all you can do is send an email and hope they respond within 3-5 days. I gave up and purchased Roxio Easy VHS to DVD3 and was pleasantly surprised with its ease of installation and its ability to do exactly what I had wanted - to capture and transfer old family video tapes to DVD.
1047	1	It never ceases to amaze me how some people write their reviews (I often wonder how many of the extreme reviews, positive and negative, are genuine??) …  I am half way through my 30-day trial and I will likely be purchasing this software.<br /><br />I read the reviews on this software and I have a couple questions …<br />1) What does the reviewer mean by, “rendering without sound”? There are volume/gain (decibel) slides for each individual audio track and the  master volume and all have a left-right balance. 2)<br />2) Why do so many reviews say they have trouble downloading? Downloaded and ran on the first try. I’ve used this program for about 20 hours over the last two weeks and I have not had a single problem.<br />3) Why don’t people read about what they are being and know what they are paying for? You won’t get a Maserati if you’re paying the price of a Ford (not knocking Ford). This is not a several hundred (or thousand) dollar video editing software suite – this is a low cost/low budget video editing software package that does exactly what is says it will do –nothing more and nothing less.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the reviewers – at first, Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum wasn’t very intuitive to me, but the more I have used it, I have learned the “intuitiveness” of the software. The couple times I used the Help feature, it really was helpful. I had used very basic software before with the capability for one video and up to 2 audio tracks. Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum has numerous editing options to help create a top quality video – but remember, you will likely not make a feature film production with this, but for family, and YouTube, etc. this is software is more than adequate. Bottom line – for a very reasonable price you get a reasonable product with Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum.
1048	1	i am one customer who has been happy with your product a real life saver in times and at all times. thank you.
1049	1	Been running a lot of advertisements for further service, of late.  Otherwise great protection.
1050	1	The features available in Quicken far exceed the online sites available for free and are a little more secure.  I have been a long-time Quicken user and keep all of my financial information in the package.  My last version was Quicken 2010 which I was notified by Intuit that they would no longer support effective next month.  However, I was happy with the 2010 version and do not see enough new features to upgrade to this version unless forced to (as I was).
1051	0	Not as good as years past.  Kind of a pain to use in this version.
1052	0	Nickle and dime ya to death for extra features.
1053	1	Makes filing really easy
1054	0	If you are using with on a computer with Windows 8 it is not compatible and will pretty much make your computer nonfunctional.
1055	1	Great product. Have used it for years and I recommend it to everyone that wants a free anti-virus that doesn't interfere with, or slow down your computer.
1056	0	The product name indicates that state is included but when you file state it redirects you to the intuit site for payment.  Other than that it was ok.
1057	1	Works perfect for what it was designed for..
1058	1	I've been using this for several years, no problems, it works a lot more transparently than some of the other well known names in the anti-virus industry. On occasion, when they have specials, I even pay for the upgraded version, because I feel bad that I'm using their product for free. Don't waste your money on the 'big dogs', this works as well or better. Highly recommend.
1059	1	-1 one star because it is messed up that a entire industry is born just to give the govt money. Pay money to pay taxes. Sad.
1060	0	Earlier version, 2007 was easier to work with. I moved to this  newer version because Mavericks was not compatible with 2007.<br />This was not a step up.
1061	-1	Please read the reviews here at Amazon!!!<br />I have been using TurboTax for a number of years. This will be the third year that there were problems with the Amazon download version of this product. I don't know it this is an Amazon specific problem or a general TurboTax issue. My software would not update properly (same problem for the last 3 years...). There is a manual update available for the Federal section of the program that can be found with a quick Bing/Google search. There is no manual update for the State packages... Last year I had to use telephone support to get the State updates to work and I guess I will be doing that again this year.<br />I did not read the reviews prior to purchasing this product, and it appears there have been changes that are not appreciated by the user community. Please read the reviews prior to purchasing this product. You may want to look at another solution. I will be looking elsewhere if I cannot get my State to update today...
1062	1	So I run McAfee LiveSafe Internet Security...  but I still managed to pick up some malware that would take over my browser every time I went to CenturyLink.net!  I worked with the CenturyLink support staff, and they finally recommended Malwarebytes.<br /><br />After installing the Malwarebytes trial version and running a scan, I was good to go!  When the trial period came to an end, I went ahead and paid the subscription price, grateful for having a machine that works.
1063	0	Do not like the new Quicken Essentials. The old version of Quicken was a much more user friendly software. Sorry they thought that something that worked so well needed a complete changeover.
1064	-1	I started using Word 2013.  the Product continuously crashes.  Hangs with the little spinning blue circle and eventually I have to resort to shutting down the application.  It is probably trying to access some internet account, I don't know.  New version is just a bunch of fluff added to Word. Also, the installation took forever. :(<br />If I can get a refund, I will promise to give you guys two stars.
1065	1	OK
1066	-1	The only reason I purchased this software was because I needed it for a class. As someone who regularly tracks their foods and exercises through a Garmin vivofit, myfitnesspal, and mapmyrun, I find this software very outdated and not very user friendly. Majority of what I eat, I make myself and it takes so much longer to creat &#34;custom foods&#34; than the other fitness trackers. Plus it is annoying to reenter things that I have already entered in a different application. I wish that there was a way to connect other fitness apps to this software. I understand that this software makes it easier for professors to look at what we are eating/doing, but as a student it is painful to deal with entering data into this software. Oh! And I almost forgot: the calorie calculation is wrong. It said that I need 2000 calories a day. I've calculated my basal calorie consumption before and with my general activity level, I should be consuming about 1,530 calories a-day plus whatever activities I do during the day. My rant is over now. Unless your professor requires that you use this, don't waste your time nor money on this subpar software.
1067	1	I'm an Aperture fan, but Lightroom's skin, face and teeth enhancement tools and presets enables much faster workflow. I had no choice but to buy LR.
1068	-1	price gauging. They make it look like everything is included once you fillup everyhting and file it tacks on additional charges for efile.. very bad selling strategy
1069	0	Does the job and cheaper than Turbotax
1070	-1	I could have just continued to use mint.com.  Quicken is not worth the price.  Mint actually works better. I miss microsoft money.
1071	0	I bought this older version of the system because I could update to the v.6 for free. Man, that ended up being more work than I thought since I had to download it separately and then delete the other older one. It took a while, but once downloaded with the new system, I was ready to go. I've had this for a few months now and it's done a great job protecting my computer against threats. However, shortly after purchasing this one and upgrading, I started getting pop-ups to install an even newer version. Plus, the message that pops up after a scan says that I still have issues with my computer and they will not be repaired unless I purchase the new version. That's a bit ridiculous to me and makes me want to just delete the entire thing and find something else. I purchased this one because of the good reviews, but didn't realize I would end up spending just as much money as on a more expensive program. All and all, I am happy with the way this program works, but am not happy with having to pay more for another update.
1072	0	I had to update because my 3 year bank download limit was closing fast.  The good news is so far no problems with the update.  Before doing the update, I validated the data with my old 2012 version.  Then I made several backups.  Next I installed the 2015 version but I told Quicken I was a new customer so the R1 release would not import my data.  Then I opened it and had the program update itself to R5.  Next I told it to open (convert) my data file (or backup file, don't remember which).  Then I ran validation on it using the new program.  All data was there and the business invoices I used were also there.  I don't have any reports that needed conversion.  Next I tried downloading bank data but it just said it was done without downloading anything.  I couldn't figure out where to check off what banks to download data from so I quit the program and restarted it.  Then the one step update worked correctly.  It has worked correctly ever since.  The screen blinks alot when Quicken is running.  I have an older laptop with a SSD and performance is ok.  Bottom line, it works with negligible improvements.
1073	0	Working as intended.  Software can be great with more options.
1074	1	I have just started with the first lessons included in the package I bought and I am happy already.<br />I`m possitive that some they in the near future I`ll be playing real music with my own hands, since the course will really take me there !<br />Also the instrument itself is of a good quality.
1075	1	works fine - so far nary a problem
1076	-1	When I downloaded this application I was exposed to a virus........how ironic.  I had to pay to have the virus removed and the Norton Software was destroyed.  I'd like my money back.
1077	1	It does what an anti virus program is supposed to do.....It keeps you safe from whats out there.I would recommend it to all my friends.
1078	-1	I have used Quicken for many years through good and bad development because I use and love the Planning tool of Savings Goals. From straight forward account balances we now have cumbersome and ridiculous graphs. Intuit has managed to ruin a great tool.  I'm not sure I have reason enough to continue to the next edition.
1079	0	Very hard to get everything just the way you want it. Last time we had a simple will made at the attorney and probably will have him do it again.
1080	0	I purchased this card program as a replacement for American greetings create-a-card 3. Which will not work on my windows 7 64 bit O.S.? As most people know once you find a card program it is hard to find a replacement one that does Cards the way you like. I found this program very hard to do a quick personalized card, And the card size that I was used to using, It does work and has a lot of other gadgets that I don't use but I can make cards if I plan ahead as it will take an hour instead of just 5 min compared to my old program. And be prepared for doing your cards over a few times as it does not always print the same way depending on what card you make. I am not real happy with this card program and if you do the down load don't download the complete program as it will never finish, there is no download manager to continue were you leave off form.  You will have to do it right from the beginning only to have it stop and try all over again. My advice buy the disk don't download.
1081	-1	Do NOT upgrade to this release. It has several bugs that Quickbooks support admitted (after making me wait for over 30 mins for support). I upgraded from 2013 to 2014 because I read that there were improvements to the online bank feeds. Unfortunately there are way too many bugs. It finally screwed up my QB file and would not allow any more credit card transactions to be added. When I tried to get an audit trail to see what changes I had made since I upgraded a week back it showed me transactions going back many years. That is when I realized that this release is way too risky to use. I have reverted back to my 2013 release.
1082	0	expensive with all the add on,It was a good thing I had virus protection on computer when downloading and sending electronically.
1083	1	Excellent features, reliable and intuitive.
1084	1	This is an excellent product. It is the best computer security system yet that I have purchased from Amazon. I purchased it and downloaded and my computer was safely secured in about 30 min.  It  lets me know what threats was taken care of, and alerts me when there are possible future threats. Overall, it's a great product.
1085	-1	I bought this to make my life easier but instead I am more frustrated and have not been able to use it at all.  I am sure it is a great program but definitely need computer skills to figure out how to work it.  Pretty complicated.
1086	-1	This is one of the most convoluted processes I have seen in in a long time. Forget downloading it from Amazon and then pasting in the code. 1) you have to find and read the redemption instructions. 2) Copy and paste the web site. 3) paste in the code 4) create an account. 5) start download 6) log into your account 6) start installation.
1087	1	I have been using Turbo Tax since the 1980's.  Never had any issues any way I purchased the product.  Unless they stop making it, I won't stop using it.  No problems at all with the download for my Mac running on Mountain Lion.
1088	0	Microsoft products-we all love to hate them. But we can't live without them. I finally have mastered MS Word-which I define as being able to actually get help from Help. And I do love a spread sheet for keeping obsessive track of my budget and expenses of all kinds. So even though I have made the switch to Mac I still gotta have MS Office.
1089	1	Easy to use!
1090	-1	I COULD NOT GET IT TO DO ANYTHING I NEEDED IT TO DO. I GUESS I NEEDED MORE OF AN ENGINEERING PROGRAM.
1091	-1	This new version is crap.  It broke the connection to my bank, now I have to update manually.  Don't buy this version.
1092	1	I see no issues yet and certainly not expecting to see any in the near future. As said, the price of the product is impressive and Amazon does a great job to get its customers the best possible prices. Happy with the product.
1093	1	The best anti-virus program that I have dealt with. Far superior over Norton and  AVG, it is much more user-friendly and much less intrusive.It has  great detection rate. It`s very lightweight, and has awesome features for remote controlling through the web. I'm very pleased with it.
1094	1	I've been using Avast! Antivirus for about 2 years now after my son recommended it to me.  I really like the fact that it auto-updates and it has stopped many viruses and other problems that have arisen.  I've recommended it to several of my friends and they have liked it very much also.
1095	-1	"This company is more interested in mining your books than helping you track or grow your money.<br /><br />I'm an early adopter of Quickbooks. I migrated from BYOB.<br /><br />Running on windows since 1998 and loved QB.<br /><br />Earlier software was robust. By far head and shoulders above the rest as a stand alone solution for start up businesses where owner / operators need to do everything themselves.<br /><br />OK<br />Maybe I'm lashing back here, but<br /><br />This company has done everything possible to shift whatever they can out of the software and into a subscription service of some kind. In the process they have alienated the clients/customers that have gotten them where they are.<br />Pulling core features from their product and covering with gimicky crap with every new release. This 2013 mac version is an expensive disappointment.<br /><br />Main complaint with this one?; They've made it nearly impossible to track payroll, much less create payroll checks, without a monthly subscription service.<br /><br />This was my last intuit purchase of any kind. I have no confidence that they have my interest in mind. IMO they are predatory at their core.<br />Expect to experience multiple exclusions of important features with the intent of forcing you into subscriptions that are imo ridiculously expensive.<br /><br />Find another accounting software system. I am furious, if you can't tell, and despise this company's policy's. I think I'm not alone with this high frustration level.<br />My bitch? Maybe it's not uncommon for companies to do this but it's stupid.<br />you buy the software from someone with all the proper licensing and validation codes still on the box, here is the catch; if they registered it prior to selling it to you, you have bought a worthless disk.<br /><br />Even if the seller does not use it anymore or sold you the original computer it was installed on.<br /><br />So, you buy into a business and buy it with all its contents and the computer system it runs on from the owner. You do the right thing and re-register all the software under the new business name and Bingo! Intuit shuts you down, pulls your access to the books and says \\""that's our policy\\"" you have to buy new software and register it in your new name and ph. number, that is the only solution.<br /><br />I guess that's just one more reason for the three day waiting period on hand gun purchases. I'm definitely an angry man looking for a new software provider.<br /><br />Any suggestions?<br />peachtree?"
1096	1	Great product, Great price. Have used H&R Block/Tax-cut for many years. Easy download. Perfect for non-profit org Fed & State plus personal taxes.
1097	-1	Didn't last for the entire trial. Shut off after 5 days
1098	-1	Seriously needs to be updated properly, very antiquated.
1099	-1	I have used this program for a number of years, largely because I feel trapped.  Importing historical information from TurboTax to this program created a world of woe for me which I never hope to repeat, so I am unwilling to try to go back to TurboTax even though in other circumstances I would do so as fast as possible.<br /><br />The Home part of Home & Business works fairly well.  In most cases what I've found is the program works adequately until you get into the really complicated stuff -- foreign tax credits, partnership income, alternative minimum tax, etc.  Then it often will dump you and refer you to IRS instructions or publications, letting you flounder.  I, at least, adopt a completely different mindset when I am using a computer program to do my returns and retain my information than I do when I am filling out paper returns and keeping my own records.  So, to have the program stop helping me in mid-return is, from my point of view, a disaster.  This is magnified on state returns where the automation is even more spotty.  If your return is relatively uncomplicated, the Home program will work fine for you.  But beware if you have less usual tax issues.<br /><br />The Business part of the program is an abomination in my opinion.  I need it for its trust, partnership and real estate rental functions.  Here the programmers often punt when the going gets tough, and it's tough luck for you.  Maybe your experience will differ if you have an S Corp. or an LLC, which are more mainstream, but in my view the pretension that this program is adequate for all business users is just that.  Still, I keep buying it because I fear the transition to another program even more than I hate this one.  If you haven't switched yet, you have been warned.
1100	0	"QuickBooks seems to be the only serious game in town for small business accounting software.  We've been Mac users for more than a decade and our business is set up on Macs...  I have to say, though, that if I had to do this over, I would convert to PCs (as frustrating as I find them) simply because that's the standard.  No business is an island, and being \\""better\\"" is no good if you can't get decent products or connect with other people.  I looked into running parallels and some version of windows and QB2012 for PC, but that is a hassle and expense I didn't want to do, plus it opens your Mac up to PC viruses.  I think maybe the right choice would have been to have just not bought the Mac, and reverted to a PC for the business, though.  The Mac version of QuickBooks is shamefully crippled compared to its PC counterparts.  We have a VERY simple business, but we've already run into shortcomings.  Among others--no way to track assets and depreciation?  Are you kidding?  I have to run a separate excel file and manually track depreciations, then manually transfer that info into a jerry-rigged depreciation expense account and debit the asset?  REALLY?!  This has been in the PC version FOREVER.  Also, you'll find most of the support is geared towards the PC version, so you'll read instructions to go under such a tab and choose this, and lo and behold, it's not present on your version!  Ooops!  You don't get that feature!<br /><br />We upgraded to this product from an old version of Quicken (06) and found the transfer a little buggy, but knew to expect that--the categories transferred correctly, but we lost all of the info in the notes/memo.  This meant that I could run a report to see how much I spent on building repair in 2010, but I can't see the explanations for what that money went to.  This only applies to the transfer from Quicken, though.  Using QB2012 is easy if you're used to computer accounting, quicken, etc.  Some of the terms and structures are different, but it's not hard to transition.  The program does occasionally freeze, making me force-quit out and re-enter, which I find sort of amateur on a new program running on a new machine, but usually you've only lost the most recent entry.  On a related note, in case you're considering whether a Mac is a feasible business computer, also know that TurboTax Small Business doesn't have a Mac version, PERIOD.  The \\""Home and Business\\"" does, but if you have a multi-member LLC, you need the \\""Small Business\\"", which is PC only.  Bummer.  We were able to successfully export our QB for Mac file to a QB for PC file to take to an accountant at tax time without a hitch, though.  She said it looked different than the PC files, but the data interacted correctly.  Bottom line:  If you're committed to Macs and won't consider changing, you've already made your bed, so buy this software and move on.  If there's any way to accept that the momentum of the conventional business world (PCs) has already made the choice for you and you're just going to have to move to the dark side and run PCs, you'll have an easier life for it."
1101	0	it is a good product - but unlike it's predecessors - Norton has seen fit to make it annoyingly tied to a required user id - they will not even let you do the 30 day trial without it.  I personally do not want continual emails from them or that much intrusion for the product that I chose to actually protect me from stopping a lot of that.<br /><br />I would buy it again  but as the competitors products get better - the annoying registration and it limitations for something I paid retail for will make me consider them again
1102	0	I always go with Norton to protect my software at home. Never lets me down. Keep me as a continuous customer.
1103	1	Simple, Easy to use, and was what I was looking for to handle my 3 rental properties.  Allows me to enter all expenses in one place and run reports that show me exactly where I stand.
1104	1	Great software, makes doing you taxes bearable.
1105	0	I've used for years and there is no significant difference in the features from when I started.  Quicken 2014 is not much different from Quicken 98.  I was forced to update.  I can understand Intuit wanting a recurring revenue stream, but I am beginning to share the view of the nay-sayers because there are a couple of problems in Quicken 2014 with no fixes in sight.  For example, I cannot correct an IRA transfer initially entered with incorrect amount.
1106	1	Much less expensive than TurboTax.  Easier to understand.  Standalone rather than linking to other programs - Quicken, Deductables, etc. (good).<br />Slam bam taxes done.
1107	1	Downloaded OK!
1108	-1	I installed this on my computer.  It locked my system up.  I had to remove it and returned the antivirus to the manufacture for a refund.
1109	1	Great product. Was able to download easily and quickly. Has all the necessary components to run the programs that I need.
1110	1	This program proved to be very easy to use.  Having this software allows you to print out as much of the forms as you would like but what's the best is that you can electronically file both state and federal taxes with little additional costs.
1111	1	It does the job.  Norton has never let anything harmful through to my machine.  It is still a resource hog, though, and sometimes 'idle' time background tasks do not seem to understand the term 'idle', but I suppose that is all the price of through protection.  The new interface looks nice.
1112	1	Quicken has been a big help for our family.  My only complaint is that it is sometimes a little flakey with the automatic download from one of my banks.  Maybe it is a problem on the banks side, but I regularily have to do the download manually - not that big of a deal though.  really a great product.
1113	0	It's okay takes some getting use too!
1114	1	Love it!! Easy to use!!
1115	1	It was fast and affordable. No physical software required - it is all done online. Highly recommend this product to everyone.
1116	0	This is a very difficult program to understand and follow.  It did put us on some roads were did not want to travel and it did have us going in circles in a few places.  It has some nice features that describes the places we visited though. The best way to use this program is not use the map feature, just use the feature that describes the up coming points of interest, in the direction you are traveling.  It works ok then
1117	1	I love the way Avast works and how it seeks and finds many types of virus's and malware and bugs...I feel it is the VERY BEST anti-virus software available today. I would recommend Avast to anyone who is serious about their computer safety...
1118	-1	THE PROBLEM - the license and product key numbers were put under a sticker that did not come off evenly and destroyed part of the numbers. Since I did not have these numbers I could not install the product. Further, the license # is needed for a warranty return.    I called a prominent support # on the Intuit website. The warranty is apparently ineffective for me since it requires a license # on the return form. Also there was no RMA# or equivalent to show a valid attempt by the manufacturer to acknowledge a return.    I offered to send copies of the Amazon receipt, a picture of the defective license and product key area, and a picture of the disk with Intuit's special marks on it. Even if the warranty is mercifully honored, without the license#, it looks like I will have to wait at least a week for it to get there, some time for it to be processed, possibly 4 weeks for a refund, and then return shipping time. This is the computer and internet age, shouldn't the warranty have involved at least an offer of electronic download?
1119	0	I upgraded from an OEM version that came on my HP desktop; which former I might have preferred, but the new works fine.<br />One great annoyance for me about the new version: it monitors Windows Backup, and raises an error report every few days if that backup has not been completed -- even though I'm using Norton Ghost for daily backups and have added that specific information in PC-Doctor Toolbox. I want the software to be configurable, not to decide my backup (or any) procedures and preferences and harass me if we don't agree on which application to use.
1120	-1	This is supposed to be a TWO year license, but it only renewed my Webroot for ONE YEAR! DO NOT PURCHASE!<br /><br />Called Amazon - They said I have to go through Webroot, since Webroot sent the product key.<br /><br />Called Webroot - THEY REFUSED TO support this purchase. They are saying I purchased this one year license last month. Apparently, they gave me someone else's software key!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY FROM WEBROOT.<br /><br />UPDATE: I called back Amazon and told them Webroot would not refund product or extend license to 2 years. Amazon agreed to prorate the amount I paid. Thanks, Amazon!<br /><br />To Webroot - Thanks for nothing. I put my computer security in your hands and you can't even send a proper product key. What does that say about your ability to protect computers? This is the last Webroot product I will purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE II: Not only did Webroot issue the same keycode to multiple users, but by accessing the web console that is a part of the program, one can access any computer using this keycode! When I checked my web console, I found someone else's computer listed there! That is, no doubt in my mind, the person who originally acquired the keycode in December 2013.<br /><br />How Webroot - a security software company - managed this mess up is beyond me. But they put my computers and the other person's computer at risk.
1121	-1	You have to Sign into the program to use it.  Then if you want to do anything on your business, they are having trouble with their program. Their Quick employer forms are a joke They are frustrating!!!!!
1122	0	Payee names change when transactions are downloaded, to names that are totally incorrect and inappropriate. When items are cleared, they must be reconciled individually rather than automatically reconciled when the program is closed, as was the case in previous editions.
1123	0	its ok,
1124	1	Excellent service. I am on many couponing sites which are known to have viruses and Avast has captured every single one.<br />Thanks
1125	1	Since we do not itemize it is rather simple to calculate taxes.  It also tells us if its is worth itemizing.  I have used this for 4 or 5 years now and I do have peace of mind everything is included and correct.
1126	0	I have used Turbo Tax for many years. This seems to work well.Was easy to download and I think I got th state downloaded easily. I have not started making entries to it yet.
1127	0	Got the Software for a bargain price of about 10 bucks. Its definitely not Lightroom but works well for minor enhancements for RAW and jpegs as well.
1128	0	Probably too early to tell on this one.  The product was easy to install, and seems to be doing its job.  Based on the reports it turns out my computer was virus free and in good shape.  Prior to installing Trend Micro I was relying on the Windows 8 Defender program, which was doing its job according to Trend Micro's report.
1129	0	The product is ok  it's just not really what I was looking for. It is a good product for scrapbooking.
1130	-1	Doesn't work. Tried to open apdf file to convert but the document would only let me change fertain things.  I jeed more from this type of program.
1131	-1	I just bought this today I cannot download it. I have a 64 bit program and I lost my key and this is only a 32 bit. So a wasted 139.00.
1132	-1	I have never been so disappointed in a product and have never given a one star before.  This software does not work as advertised.  In setting it up I attempted to download my account information from Fidelity, and it would only download a few of my investments and not my entire portfolio.  Tried several times to no avail.<br /><br />I then tried setting up a new clean user file, and then attempted the download from Fidelity again.  This time NONE of the investments downloaded.  Seems to be very unreliable.<br /><br />I spent an hour on the phone with Fidelity and they couldn't resolve it.  So, I then attempted to contact Intuit through their chat support.  I spent 30 minutes waiting in the queue only to be booted out with a message &#34;There are no agents to chat with you now&#34; even though they tout 24/7 service.  Tried again for another 30 minutes, and the same message.  Then tried to email them, and the Email button led me back to a series of &#34;help yourself&#34; questions.  Totally frustrating!
1133	1	Didn't have any problems with it.  It can be a little complicated if you aren't familiar with how to do taxes but most of the questions are easy to answer and get it electronically filed.
1134	0	I bought Toast 11 Titanium specifically for moving files from my Tivo to my Macbook Air. I do not create or edit videos, so I was not and am not interested in the other features of the software. Therefore my mileage may vary from other users.<br /><br />The Mac download from Amazon worked just fine. Installation went smoothly and when it concluded I configured the software to communicate with my Tivo. Transfers have worked fine. I've moved quite a few movies and confirmed that I can play them.<br /><br />The only disappointment I've had is that the transfers take forever. Usually a bit over an hour. I've gotten around this by queuing the transfers when I'm not using the computer. Otherwise I'm happy with the purchase.
1135	0	"It has the basics, but only just. I think it would be difficult to communicate in Occitan with the vocabulary provided by this product. I'd like to see a level 2 or level 3 of this course.<br /><br />It's fairly well produced, but I found it very disconcerting on the initial start-up when the program displays \\""Learn Ancient Greek\\"" on the first screen. The symbols for \\""Back\\"" and exit are a little strange as well, the Back button being represented by a foot ( sole view) and Exit appears to be a human figure walking.<br /><br />It's not a difficult course. The games are pleasant and reinforce the vocabulary. Plus, there's a difficulty option on the word games.<br /><br />The audio features both male and female speakers and a photographic representation ( as well as a cartoon version if you prefer) of each. The animation isn't bad, but the mouths of both speakers seem a little unnatural when moving.<br /><br />The product can also be installed to an iPod, but lacking one, I couldn't verify this.<br /><br />My bottom line: not a bad introduction, but more depth would be nice. Technically,some of the icons could be improved and in general a little more attention to detail would have been nice, but it's usable and I have yet to suffer a crash under Windows 8.<br /><br />Adieu-siatz!"
1136	-1	I wanted to leave a one star review for this Amazon / Garmin debacle but I just got a reply from Garmin to the support inquiry that I emailed them yesterday. They say that they and Amazon are aware of the problem and that Amazon will be emailing a new product key today or tomorrow that will work. That aside, the customer support from both of these companies is pathetic, at best. At least Garmin's response was fairly timely and helpful, I hope. Just keep the faith. It will get worked out.    5/4/2010      I received an email from Amazon a few hours after posting this review letting me know that I could go ahead and download the map upgrade. I was able to do it immediately and without any further problems. Whew!
1137	1	This program is very user friendly and easy to use.  I enjoyed doing taxes and never had to start over.
1138	1	Longtime Turbotax user.  Read the reviews and H&R Block was much cheaper than the compatible Turbotax version.  Plus, no known security issues and name brand recognition.  Will use from now on.
1139	0	I have used the online in the past. Getting this to recognize last year's files was a nightmare. Calling did not help. As always, I love how this program walks me through what I need to do to get my taxes filed. However, they need to work on their ability to work on different platforms. I have used online, disc, and now this download. This was my most frustrating experience.
1140	0	You download the program and it has you set up a login where you can purchase additional lessons.  The lessons are done by slide shows of medium to low resolution photos.  It reminds me of the movies we used to watch in class 30 years ago with the background voice that sort of lulls you to sleep while the animations changed on the screen.<br />There is a lot of skipping/jumping of the slides and voice over. A bit glitchy in my opinion.<br />It is ok, but not riveting enough for me to make additional purchases from them.  For a very basic presentation, it might be ok.
1141	1	I bought the download version and had trouble completing download with IE 10, but Chrome seemed to work just fine
1142	-1	Do not download onto your computer!  After I downloaded it I could no longer use my Microsoft Office, printer, computer speakers, etc.  My internet security had expired a few days before I downloaded it and the Avast would not allow me to activate any security product.  Now my computer will not allow me to access the internet.  Had to take it to a professional to have fixed.
1143	-1	I had the worse experience trying to download this product.  Amazon's customer service directed me to Microsoft for help.  MS could not get this product to download and had me purchase the program directly from them, assuring me that Amazon would give me a refund for the product I bought from them.  Amazon said no and discounted the actions of MS.  Finally, after a couple of days, I contacted MS's account department, and they graciously refunded the purchase with my promise to remove the product from my computer.  Gladly done.  So, now I am stuck with the program I got from Amazon that won't download.  Not only did they take my money, the time and engery this ordeal it took was exhausting.<br />Update - Amazon's customer service call me back today and got me up and running.  Thank you.
1144	0	The product itself, warts and all, is about as good as you can get in this class of software.  Others have covered the software pretty well.  I agree with complaints about the annoying update alerts that start 30 days before your agreement runs out--the goal here is not a helpful tip, but rather to annoy you into turning your 12 month purchase into an 11 month purchase.<br /><br />The download itself is pretty clunky.  The download starts out as nothing but a download manager.  That downloads another file, which downloads more stuff, defaulting to deeply embedded locations.  The end result is that no matter what you try to do you end up downloading everything 3 times, once on each computer.  For a 3-computer license it would be much better to download everything needed for installation to one KNOWN location.  That way this could be easily moved to the other two locations, sparing a lot of download time.  Then install on each computer without further downloads, except for updating files on each when the basic installation is complete.  As it is, you tie up your internet lines with 3 separate downloads.  Rather typical of Norton.
1145	1	Exactly what i needed for my business.  However, it should be included in the Microsoft Office package because it is used a lot in many home offices.
1146	0	I purchased this product, with the hope it would interface completely with the Mac OS 10.8.  It loaded and worked but as time went on, aborts or crashes began happening 3 and 4 times a day.  The program recovered most of my message most of the time, but it was frustrating.  Then I decided to drag photos into the message.  Not a good idea.  Sometimes it worked, other times CRASH.  I use Gmail, and several accounts.  All of a sudden it sent a message saying I had too many gmail accounts open.  I labored over that error message a while and finally realized that I had a second Gmail account open in Safari, and one in my Mac Mail, which I was still using for my personal mail.  So, I shut these down and outlook then asked for my password ... ugh... Finally, with my other gmail accounts shut down, I was able to proceed.  I don't really know the number of gmail accounts it takes to get Outlook mad, I just know that once it gets mad, there is no arguing, you are out of business.  This, coupled with a crashing of Word without recovery and disk write problems makes me want to return the product... but I downloaded it and that is my mistake.<br /><br />Outlook is just not ready for prime time in the OSX environment.  I figured out a way to do what I needed in MacMail and have basically shut down Outlook and took a loss on my taxes.  I can't run a business with part time help in this area.<br /><br />One last thing.. I was on OSX 10.8 with all updates and MS Office had all updates... and I sent errors to MS.  So, I hope they fix it.  But I am done.
1147	1	I love Avast.  For me it's been the best and most trouble free antivirus I've ever used.  What makes Avast the best available is not only superior protection shielding and scanning detection but the addition of other support applications in the suite, such as remote assistance in the help tab, and the software updater to keep ancillary browser software up-to-date more safely than being bombarded with updates of unknown provenance. Nothing is 100% effective all the time but I haven't had any problems for so long my confidence level is very, very high when it comes to Avast. Not to diminish Avast at all, but I cross check Avast with Malware Bytes Anti Malware which is yet another yard stick with which to measure Avast's overall effectiveness.
1148	1	DO NOT BLAME SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD DIFFICULTIES ON THE SOFTWARE!!!  I was planning to actually time the download process and the software loaded so quickly that I never had the chance to do so.  You might want to inquire with your Internet provider to find out what download speed they are providing to you and make sure you have no issues there (I have a cable connection).  In about two minutes the program was fully downloaded to my computer.  A click of my mouse and voila, the program opened on my monitor and I started testing it out.  Perfect!  I have no complaints.  I was familiar with a very old version of Microsoft Publisher and was leery. . . after all of the bad reviews I had read, but I am happy to report that I have used this 2013 version for several days now and love it!<br /><br />If you have never used any version of Microsoft Publisher in the past and are not familiar with desktop publishing software, be aware that there is a learning curve.  However, but if you have a little patience and are willing to take the time to learn the program you will be very happy you did.<br /><br />There are many desktop publishing software programs available on the market but, personally, I like the compatibility of Microsoft Publisher with my other Microsoft programs.<br /><br />My only complaint against Microsoft is this:  I have two laptops and I think it is a total rip off that we can't load Microsoft software we purchase on more than one computer now!
1149	0	I got it after many years use of Intuit software, to protest their underhanded methods of upselling Turbotax. Worked out better than I expected although a couple of errors showed up in Fed and State reviews. I haven't figured out why yet, and if the mistakes were mine or theirs but feel that the software should have caught them. Will probably reorder H&R for next tax year.
1150	1	It ask all the right questions in the right places.  State compliant.  Good value.<br />I will recommend this to anyone.
1151	0	I paid for MS Office.<br />I downloaded and installed MS Office with no problem.<br />After installing there was no way to access and run the MS Office programs.<br />I had to hunt to try to find a way to get in contact with Microsoft. I kept getting referred to FAQ. Very Frustrating.<br />I finally found a way to contact Microsoft...the email did not work but I called and got connected with an excellent tech rep. She knew exactly what to do. She set up icons on the start page so I could actually run Word, Excel, Access, etc.
1152	0	I'm upgrading from 2012, but my data file used 2003, even 2002, so because of that, I have to uninstall 2013, download 2004, open my data file in 2004, uninstall 2004, reinstall 2013...I am scared to death that I am going to lose ALL THAT DATA! I mean, come on, 2013! This is a horror story! I haven't done this yet, therefore I can't tell you if I like 2013 yet. I want all my data, not just the 83 days that my bank will allow. I'll take the plunge, but I'm getting my feet used to the COLD WATERS of 2013 first. BTW, I've used Quicken forever.

1154	0	the app for quicken is nice, however i felt things were not<br />explained well enough. that is my fault for not digging into<br />the workings before i upgraded.
1155	-1	Ordered norton internet security 2013 by accident when trying to renew to Norton 360. My mistake. Had for 5 days before I reordered the 360. Installation was easy via software download but instantly my laptop developed problems. The fan ran much more often, pages took longer to open and wake up from idle was quite slow. Ordered the 360 suite and all was back to normal as soon as that product was downloaded and installed.<br />Not a computer whiz by any means and it's always possible that there was another reason for the slow down but I was left unimpressed by the internet security 2013.<br />Recommend 360 instead.

1158	0	"Serious question ...<br /><br />I currently have, for example, Microsoft Word for Mac 2011, version 14.32 ... and the matching Excel, PowerPoint.<br /><br />These versions come after successive upgrades from the last major release of Office.<br /><br />So what is so special about this so-called \\""current\\"" version?<br /><br />HAALP<br /><br />John Love"
1159	0	Only bought Quicken 2105 because Quicken was dropping allowing importing data from my bank from the version I was using. Pretty sneaky way to force you to spend money for a newer version. Not at all happy.
1160	-1	Every year that Intuit rewrites Quicken it just gets worse and worse! Budgeting use to be a breeze and now it is a pain. Reports use to be easy to setup and now they're a pain.  This is so weird Intuit can't keep things that work, with each upgrade it gets worse.
1161	-1	Buggy software.  It corrupted my data twice already.  I had to go back to the backup and enter/download all transactions again.  I am in the similar profession (software development), cannot imagine for the life of me, how this passed QA and released for general public.
1162	0	I can't figure this program out.  I am to much of a novice.  Probably a great product but WAY over my head on what I need it for.  Leave this ones to the experts.
1163	0	You cannot easily pay &#34;employees&#34; for $199. You can only easily pay ONE employee for $199. Each additional is $24 per year.<br />Like others have written, watch out for their &#34;automatic&#34; overpriced renewals.
1164	-1	I was unable to load the product, so I ended up buying Microsoft Office 2010. I just lost lots of $$$$, because I was unaware of your return policies.
1165	1	Very worthwhile product and a great deal especially if you have 3 PCs to put it on.  Some minor glitches in the installation process but I accomplished it on my own with little grief.  Having Word and Powerpoint is very useful.
1166	0	Free is good but don't expect it to stay free. As with all things they try to get you to upgrade but at a good price. You can register to keep the product free but you are still going to get that upgrade window popping up.
1167	0	Add my Bank - No WAY!!!  Can do so with Mint and with the old FinanceWorks and with MoneyDesktop, but Quicken can not find it.  And, Quicken will not use the banks URL.  What do I do, enter the data manually?  I don't think so, I can suck it into Excel or Access. Quicken - this is terrible.  I must be mistaken.  But I don't see how?  Going to attempt to stop payment from my Credit Card. But.... I  requested assistance from Quicken Customer Care - Chat - resolved the issue to my complete satisfaction.  Seems the lookup file for banks was stale.    Why?  I had just downloaded it from them, not a bargain bin at the Dollar Store.
1168	-1	I was very excited about this product because I wanted to get into editing, however this product took forever to download and on top of that the software freezes. I've had it for about a month and still haven't edit anything because it doesn't want to be responsive. NOT FOR ME !
1169	0	This is the video editing software I always want to love--but somehow, it's like dating a charming person with a pretty face and a smokin' hot bod, but finding out you just can't stand some of their quirks. I have used a number of competitors and while I love the interface of Adobe Premiere Elements the BEST, the performance is not always up to par. And if your computer is a bit long in the tooth (mine is 5 yrs old) and if its video card and memory and other specs are not up to current standards, performance will suffer even more--that is, you'll crash frequently as you stress your system. Video editing is resource hungry.<br /><br />Good Stuff:<br /><br />There is a new Guided mode. This is what I loved about Pinnacle, a competing video editor--until it was acquired by Avid and changed radically. In Premiere, The Guided Mode is great for anyone who is new to video editing, or just doesn't have a lot of time to get a project up and running.<br /><br />Guided Mode will take you through trimming your clip, adding music and voice over, adding transitions between scenes. Like Photoshop Elements for still photographs, the Guided Mode is very helpful to learn and grow with the software, or just to save time.<br /><br />Quick Mode: has film effects and instant-movie.<br /><br />Works with the Organizer we know and love, to add media. As with Photoshop Elements, you really now start with the Organizer, then after you gather your media, you start your video project.<br /><br />Advanced features: Chroma Keying, videomerge (with making background transparent to merge green screen clips), 2D and 3D transitions (I haven't tried 3D) opacity adjustment, keyframe timed events, picture-in-picture. You can get some advanced effects if you are skilled at video editing.<br /><br />BAD STUFF:<br /><br />Very slow to output finished film to MPEG-4; slower than Premiere Elements 11! (Not as slow as Pinnacle, however, so I like Premiere 12 better!)<br /><br />Languages supported: No Spanish version in MAC: Only English, German and French. However, Windows version supports English, German, SPANISH, French, Italian, Dutch, Polish and Brazilian Portuguese.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />I love the interface and find it the most intuitive of all video packages. It is not as fast, however, as Version 11.  So is it a DOWNGRADE? Well, the organizer is an UPGRADE, but the performance is a downgrade.<br /><br />If you are concerned about performance, you can download a trial, which I suggest to see if it performs on your computer system. This is helpful to determine if you like it well enough to buy, upgrade or if it will crash and burn. You can download the trial directly from Adobe. Unlike trial versions of Photoshop Elements, trials of Photoshop Premiere put a watermark on your produced film due to license issues. Once you enter a valid serial number, the watermark will be removed. I bought mine as a package with Photoshop Elements 12 because I certainly wanted the upgrade to Elements. And I like this intereface for video editing even though there are better packages (PowerDirector, Pinnacle.)<br /><br />SUPPORTED FORMATS<br /><br />Adobe Premiere Elements supported import/export formats include: AVCHD, Blu-ray Disc (export only), DV-AVI (import/ export on Windows, import only on Mac OS), DVD, Dolby® Digital Stereo, H.264, HDV, MPEG-1 (import only), MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MP3, QuickTime, Windows Media (Windows only), and many more.

1170	1	I started doing my own taxes after 2009 and I was terrified to even think of filling taxes. With the step by step guide Turbo Tax helps me file federal and state taxes fast and efficient! I LOVE this software and it beats my accountant I used to use.
1171	0	Not exactly what I had expected it to be but I can work with it.
1172	1	I have been a Quicken user for over 15 years and read the reviews for Quicken 2014 and was surprised by all of the negative comments.  I was able to download the software and transfer my backup files in less than ten minutes!  I wanted to try the attachment of receipts to a transaction.  Once I found where the file of the picture of the receipt was on my phone, I was able to upload it to Quicken and attach it to my transaction.  COOL!!  I did it a couple times because it wasn't showing up as an attachment.  I just had to go to settings under Register Columns and check the Attachments box and there it was!<br /><br />Everything is working great and the price from Amazon was cheaper than from Quicken.  How do they do that!
1173	0	Does not have the worksheet to prove insolvency for form 982.  If you purchase this software, you will have to print the worksheet from the IRS website and attach it to your printed tax return and mail it.  Defeats the purpose of the software and e-filing.  Also, makes you wonder what other worksheets it may not have.  And from my research Turbo Tax Deluxe has the worksheet to prove insolvency for form 982.
1174	1	I have used every tax software available throughout the years to do my taxes. I have been to many different tax preparer's offices as well. I don't like paying someone for something that I am supposed to be able to do myself. When I was in high school the forms were easy enough I picked them up from the post office and did the math myself. Now, there are so many deductions available and so many caveats that there is no way I could do the paperwork myself. With that in mind, I have tried everything available. What works for one does not always work for another, so keep that in mind.<br />H & R Block has done a great job of simplifying everything and making it easy to sincerely get your best return. The difference between me doing this by hand and me letting H & R Block's software help me was literally worth a grand and then some. If you are due any money back for anything, they will find it.<br />Aside from being happy with how well the program worked, it did not take that long to install. I downloaded it, there are hard copy versions available as well. The whole process for downloading and installing took maybe ten minutes, plus remembering to look at the screen to accept the usual slough of &#34;licensing agreements&#34; and letting Norton know it was ok. Filing my return took about an hour. It asks you what I call &#34;Principal questions&#34; to determine whether or not you need to explore deeper into certain, credits, deductions, etc. Under each of these, other simple yes or no questions will be asked until the program determines you are either eligible or ineligible for that specific category. Occassionally it asked me for information from specific forms. Notedly, my W-2's (of course), and because I'm a student my 1098-T. If you have any forms you have been mailed concerning tax breaks it will eventually prompt you to enter the information. Don't worry! Anything you do not feel the software covers, H & R Block has provided live customer service for. The program was extremely thourough. State taxes for my state are still not finished being revised as of today. Also, federal returns will not start being processed by the IRS until Jan. 31, 2013. So, if you have any corrections you have time to make them before the IRS is ready to take your &#34;final draft.&#34;was extremely thourough.

1175	1	I have used this program for many years with great success. Nothing but positives from me.<br />Thank you H&R Block.
1176	-1	It can NOT be downloaded
1177	0	Running on a Parallels VM in Mac OS snow leopard and definitely experience stability issues. I use the budget function heavily (upgraded frm 2011) and there is heavy update there, but geared toward the person who probably didn't use budgeting previously. (Eg, I aggregate personal expenses on multiple categories for multiple businesses I operate...usually by a journal entry in my primary checking account. This version doesn't recognize a net zero journal as a transaction and doesn't pull the category amounts into the budget actual numbers. Easy enough to work around, but a pain to update 5 months of daily JEs to get my 2014 budget to read properly.)<br />All in all, not the best intuit update I've seen, but certainly FAR from the worst (some of the POS updates in the last 5 years were heinous).
1178	0	Quickbooks is a huge help to small business and we use ours constantly. However there are a lot of multi user bugs. We are constantly kicking each other off and then error messages come up.
1179	-1	This particular product was not at all what I needed so I called the customer service number as returns aren't available through Amazon.  The customer service was not only rude, but two of their agents were insulting and one yelled at me because I didn't like that he was hustling me to buy other products not related to quickbooks at all.  If you buy the product, hopefully you won't need any help with it.
1180	0	Only thing I don't like is it's announcements that it has been updated. Price was right and it seems to work reasonably well at detecting threats.
1181	1	I purchased this product for our Amazon store that sells,[[ASIN:B00DU1JBNS Small, Medium, Large & Extra Large Orthopedic 4 Pound Memory Foam Dog Beds, Washable, Suede, 30 Day Money-Back Guarantee, # 1 Best Rated Pet Beds, Great Dog Beds For Large Dogs, Quality Large Dog Beds]] about 3 months ago. It has been an indispensable tool. It is very user friendly, easy to connect to the internet and download your information. I would not recommend any other product.
1182	-1	Used this the past few years, but due to their new pricing I have switched to HR Block, which is much more reasonably priced.
1183	-1	The product does everything I need, so I have no complaints there. The issue I have is that once the 1 year subscription runs out, you have to pay &#34;Intuit's price&#34; for it, which is 275% more than the Amazon price. It's even significantly more than what Amazon is showing as the list price.<br /><br />I was told by customer service that I had to either pay their inflated price, or buy it again from Amazon and export all of my data, create a new account online, and import all of my data, and hopefully not mess anything up in the process. I am currently waiting on a call back from a supervisor, at a future date because they didn't have any supervisors in their call center. I wish I had purchased the desktop version instead.
1184	0	This software does some things well.  But some of the &#34;features&#34; (bates numbering) don't work, and I have had to reinstall the software twice because of bugs.  The support is flat-out wrong on many issues.  I never had these issues with my Acrobat IX Pro, and now I wish I'd updated to XI Pro.  If you are a legal professional, get the Pro.
1185	-1	It did NOT work and locked up to the point that I had to do a &#34;CNTL ESC&#34; to get out of the display.
1186	0	Back in Nov 2012 I tried Microsoft  Free 60 day trial version of their New office 2013 programs  Why because I like to stay on cutting edge of technology and computers & software is my hobby plus it behooves me to keep them up to date when running my various businesses. So after my freebie was up I tried to uninstall it from my computer  ahhhhhhhhhh big mistake. It required me to call tech support to find out how to get my Old 2007 Office to work again  after I & tech support did a remote check I learned I needed to reinstall  Office 2007 again doing a complete reinstall bummer was I miffed. Well did the reinstall and found 2 problems Outlook 2007 did not work and also my word 2007 kept giving me error messages of one type or another. So back to support I go only to find out I be charged for this  Now I am really ticked off so I did the hunt and pick routine on their online support & customer forums sections.  I did not get the information I needed to get my Outlook to work. So I called Microsoft 1 more time but again No help they must charge me for support since Office 2007 is no longer a supported product.  So Saturday I agreed to try their Office 365 with the agreement that my card will not be charged until the 30 days is up and will be given the option monthly subscription or the yearly  $99 price tag & will allow me to install it on my other computers in my home up to (5).  Once I did that my Office 2007 Outlook and Word programs worked Go figure.  So is it worth it I say yes  since the days of CD/DVD will be coming to an end when companies can send it digitally to you for less than costs of postage. Lastly I think it was cheaper than less time consuming & eliminating the head aches associated with what appears to be obsolete programs (2007 Office)
1187	1	"I have recently found myself in the unenviable position of researching Internet security suites after my previous solution (which shall remain nameless but is one of the \\""big 3\\"" suites that tops the review lists all of the time) started having major issues, particularly with activation. I scoured lots of reviews, lab results and any other resources I could track down and finally arrived at G Data. I am not that far down the road with it but so far it seems to be competent security that does not get in the way. It does have a couple of drawbacks, though, that merit mention.<br /><br />First things first - I read a few accounts online of difficult installation, after I had G Data installed and operational. It repeatedly installed smoothly and without incident on two separate systems and gave me absolutely no trouble during the process. This is a good sign out of the box. There are enough people out there that complain about the installation though, so keep this in mind - there is a potential for a little trouble while trying to get the software deployed.<br /><br />Once up and running, G Data has a very straightforward and uncluttered interface. Each major category of component has its own page in the main dialog accessible with an icon to it. It is presented in a summary/report style, which to me makes good sense - all information about the system is nicely summarized and available without too much searching. According to several reviews on the net, the interface has gone through a recent overhaul.<br /><br />I checked the resource usage and G Data is actually very kind to the system when up and running. I expected it to gobble up huge amounts of memory and CPU cycles but it has a modest footprint. Delving deeper into the process list, there are 6-10 main processes that are running under a standard boot-up and in a mostly idle state there are approximately 160 threads (most of which come from the combined firewall processes and the proxy service).<br /><br />When running a scan, I discovered a couple of things about G Data. First, it is far and away the slowest scanner I have ever used. As an example I told it to do a rootkit scan and after two and a half hours it was still less than half-way done. However, though it's slow it does not leave the system in an unusable state when the scan is running, and the scans run a lot faster on subsequent runs. I would not want to run the scan while playing an intense game or doing software compiles, but for a lot of things the scan stays out of the way and allows the user to get things done while it grinds along. I was pleasantly surprised to see that memory and CPU usage are not outrageously impacted during scans.<br /><br />G Data was put on a system that I believed to be clean because of the previous security suite in place. I lit off the scanner and it found a trojan horse buried in an email dating back several months. I traced this back to an email in my junk mail folder that had come from an unknown source and included an attachment which itself was an archive containing a suspicious executable file. This was an eye-opener. How did the other suite's scanner miss this, over repeated scans? Worse, this email database was packed up and moved between systems and was scanned on more than one computer. On just one pass, G Data's scanner found something one of its main competitors missed on multiple passes over the course of months (and should never have allowed to reach the filesystem in the first place). If I had been silly enough to open this attachment and run the file, I could have had an issue.<br /><br />I pay particular interest to firewalls and was curious to see how well the firewall would do in hiding my system on the net. To summarize, it left no ports open and it did not allow access to the system which is what I want. I have not yet tried to circumvent the firewall so I am not sure if I can exploit it somehow but initial indications suggest that I will not have an easy time with this task.<br /><br />The parental controls are mediocre - neither great nor terrible. I turned on the parental controls for myself and set out to find more nefarious places on the net. The results were mixed. It blocked certain sites as expected and it allowed access to others. If you need really tight parental controls I have seen better implementations but these work well enough for supplemental controls.<br /><br />I particularly like the autostart manager which allows access to the list of programs and processes that start every time Windows is booted. This component gives a very clear view of what is starting. What it does not do, though, is allow the user to delete things from this list which is unfortunate. I suppose at least knowing is a good start.<br /><br />I can't yet say if the antispam component is very effective. I have not gotten enough spam since installing G Data to really make a judgment on this, but so far it seems to be working. Once I have enough metrics to know for sure if it's effective I will return here to update my review.<br /><br />I ran into an issue when I purchased a license for the product - the activation server refused my code. I thought this was really odd since I bought it directly from G Data... I found the 24/7 support number and called them up. I spoke with a fellow who told me that the activation server was at that time having some issues and that I should try to activate again in a few hours. I thought he was blowing me off to get me off the phone but it turns out he was right on the money - I tried activation again the next morning and everything worked as it was supposed to work, my program activated and all has been well since. The timing of this issue was exceptionally unfortunate but it turned out fine.<br /><br />Overall I am satisfied with G Data's Internet security solution. It appears to be protecting my system and it does a fine job of staying out of the way. It finds stuff that at least one more popular security suite let through. There are a few minor gripes with it such as scanning speed and inconsistent parental controls but these issues are not enough to be deal breakers for me.

1189	1	I can remember the first time I heard him (CCR) I was probably abut 7-8, that was 45 years ago. He still has it too to me. Creedence Clearwater was one of the last bands that didn't have all the machines that distort what they sounded like, it was just John & Tom Fogerty, Stu Cook and Dug Clifford on the drums. I really don't know why they hit me at such a young age but everybody through high school that I played them for instantly liked them too. If you have never hard of CCR just give them a try and see if it was just me or if you can see what I mean by its just them, no distortion from the synthesizers or whatever they're called.
1190	1	It had been awhile since I first started using Photoshop Elements - v3. So I was not looking forward to installing v 12 and basically learning a whole new program.  The install went smoothly, downloading is much better  than waiting for a box to arrive and fumbling with media to install it.  It was so quick, I doubted it had happened and rechecked to be sure.  Then on to learning the new version...  Thank Heavens for online tutorials from Lynda.  With the small focus topics, I was able to relearn all the essential steps, one at a time, to resume using Photoshop Elements to manage my art images, resize then for upload to various art venues , and FINALLY organize them into coherent folders - something I had procrastinated far too long.  Within the first hour, I felt I was better able to use v 12 than I had been for v3.
1191	1	I've used H&R Block's tax software since 2009 when it was still Taxcut, and have never had any problems with it.  I used to do taxes by hand when I only had to take a standard deduction, but went with software after purchasing a home and switching to itemized deductions.  I don't think my taxes are all that difficult, but HR Block software just makes it so easy, and I'm typically done in a half hour or so.<br /><br />Frankly, I went with HR Block simply for the cost (they typically offer 50% discounts february-ish?), and the download from Amazon makes things so simple.  It reads my previous year's save files and imports everything for me, and I can e-file and get direct deposits.  I think the thing I love most is the donation calculator, that's been a crucial time and money saver!

1194	1	It's great particularly if you have done your taxes with TurboTax in the past.  I love the way it inhales your old data and let you change only what is different from the previous year.  The walk-thrus are really helpful in asking questions in a manner that doesn't require you to understand tax speak.  Be careful using your copy of TurboTax to do someone elses taxes.  All though the program even encourages you to do it you will be charged $39.99 to complete a state tax for that other person plus the $19.99 filing fee.  I completed the 2nd Federal tax fine but then you get hit with the $39.99 extra to do the state.
1195	0	I wish this product were a little more user-friendly and didn't require classes to understand.  I'm a small business owner so taking the time to take classes and do the work myself, while necessary, isn't a favorable use of my time.
1196	-1	Not satisfied - first order was returned because it was not for the Mac, second one that was sent was  not for the Mac.  I gave up, on this order I was totally not satisfied.  For a $200 book you would have thought you could have sent the right book.
1197	1	The program is very user friendly. Provides you with all the information to operate your business efficiently. You can get reports for every area of your business.
1198	0	I bought the download version from Amazon, which is the lowest price.  Turbo tax deluxe gets more complicated each year.  There is the pesky update every time you bring it up.  I know most of its prohibitions are for the sake of the law and TT's guarantee of safety from an audit.  I guess my final word is that our Federal tax structure is getting far to complicated for the average layman-Turbo tax does its best to keep up!
1199	0	Basically it does what it says it will do on basic taxes and I have used it satisfacorily for years to handle reporting all the info. for my rental property. But this year I had to report some special circumstances for my rental prop. and TurboTax offered NO support: not in the software, the forums or from the TurboTax experts. I had to report a change in cost basis for my property due to my husband's death in 2012, capitalize the cost of improvements I was making in order to put it on the market and report the depreciation on the original basis. These circumstances have to be fairly common, but TurboTax didn't pick it up and deal with it AT ALL; and please note that I bought the premier version which is supposed to deal with rental props. When I asked a TurboTax expert via their chat feature how to report these events, he told me that TurboTax wasn't set up to handle this situation. ??? When he instructed me to end the chat session before sending me the transcript; I pointed out that ending the session would prevent me receiving the transcript, but he insisted that he couldn't send it to me UNTIL I ended the session. Needless to say, he was wrong.<br /><br />I had to do ALL the research and legwork to figure out how to report these events, so ended up feeling as though I might as well have filed on paper, there was basically no advantage to using TurboTax this year.
1200	1	Great value on a terrific product.<br /><br />Premiere Elements makes movie editing a simple task.<br /><br />Photoshop contains an organizer and the always great photo enhancement suite.<br /><br />Downloaded both of these , and they work perfectly
1201	0	It required flash in the system, and it was not mentioned in the product requirement. So, I was not able to use it.
1202	0	It's way better than piece of crap Essentials, but still has a way to go before it will be up to snuff. I would never have bought this if I knew how easy it was to update Q2007 to run on the latest OS X release. Found this out after I purchased this. Go to the Quicken website - you can do the upgrade for $15 and keep using your current files. Hope this helps
1203	1	I needed a good zip and unzip app.<br />This is it. It has a capacity to do a number of things.<br />However my main need is to unzip large download files and it does that very well.<br />It's a good one but more complex than I need so it's a 4, for me anyway.
1204	1	It is a little more difficult to use, I like to be able to press a button and print<br />my ledger, but it is quicker.
1205	1	After it failed to install on a new Windows7 64 image drive after 6 tries, I submitted to Nuance's technical support who installed it using a technique that was not described in the installation instructions... not good, but I am happy now that it is installed.
1206	0	Though it offers the required protection, I feel the software sucks a lot of bandwidth and memory.
1207	1	I tried this and Taxcut.<br />Taxcut noted the mileage deduction for charitable activity, TT didn't. Small money for us, potentially large for others - depends on mileage.<br /><br />Both TT & TaxCut import from financial inst. Taxcut isn't as obvious about what was pulled (for this reader, at least).<br /><br />Taxcut lets one allocate income for days worked out of the state earned in. (Which I believe is legal, based on my reading of the code)<br />TurboTax seems to follow whatever is on the W-2, that is, if it's not in print, taxes are due for all pay from company in that state; regardless of where you worked on those days. I work at home every Friday, but my HR department doesn't record this.<br />I know others use Taxcut for state returns, to get that return money - which is theirs per tax code. (Think of sales people selling out of state)<br />I looked at the hassle, and more difficult to use/less guided mode of Taxcut and decided to forgo the money in favor of keeping my time.<br />I've also used TT for years, and am familiar (comfort\able?) with it's phrasings of the arcane tax code, which lead me to believe I'm doing it right.<br />If Taxcut were slightly easier (install on Windows 8.1 directly, without a workaround, for instance) I'd use it to save the $20 and get the State return. Maybe next year?<br /><br />The less I read tax codes, the more I like the product supporting my ignorance.<br /><br />My friend's comment is TurboTax is for Idiots - I'm comfortable with that, so long as it seems to be basically correct and save my time.
1208	1	Switched to H&R Block software after using TurboTax for over 10 years.  H&R pulled in my previous turbotax and quicken information and did everything I need to complete my taxes for almost half the price of TurboTax and including the features that TurboTax removed from there deluxe version this year (which is the main reason I switched).
1209	-1	Quicken is a monopoly.  Please work with another vendor to come up with competition for Quicken!!!  Too expensive for what it does.  Tax software is much better and costs less money.
1210	-1	While the basic functionality hasn't changed in years it is adequate for register activity.  What is disappointing and should be embarrassing to Intuit is the report writing. It is still clunky, doesn't save well and prints like an amateur.  Why is something so basic so difficult after all these years?
1211	1	All these years, I paid a tax person to do my taxes.  This year, I took a chance, and purchased Turbo Tax.  I was amazed how easy it was.  Turbo Tax walked me through everything.  I will be using Turbo Tax from now on.
1212	0	Constant crashing issues since I installed Quicken Home and Business on 1/3/15.  I upgraded my software from the 2010 version and so far wish I had not!!!    Follow up 1/7/15.    Intuit send me the update information and link to version #3.  The bug fixes have been remedied.     Why Amazon sent an old version of this software without the version 3 fixes bothers me.     I have now given the product 3 stars instead of the meager 1.
1213	1	Avast Free Antivirus has always been up to date with the latest threats. It doesn't seem to miss anything and very much takes care of itself. It makes a non intrusive announcement every time it has been updated and every time it detects a threat. This is definitely the best Free Anti virus program I have discovered so far.
1214	-1	"I purchased the product for download last night so I could get the free upgrade to windows media center.  It is unfortunate that Microsoft decided to take away features.  This reminds me of why I hat apple so much.  My entire entertainment center is based around my ability to record tv and other programs onto my computer.  Well I ponied up the cash and now I can't even download the program.  Customer service is \\""working on the issue\\""  meanwhile I sit here wondering if I will miss the next episode of Revenge or The Walking Dead because my New laptop doesn't have media center.  Good job Microsoft for upsetting so many loyal customers.<br /><br />As for windows 8, I have been playing with it for about 6 hours now.  Once you get past the initial shock that nothing seems to be the same and get the free app windows 8 secrets it opens up and becomes not so troublesome.  windows key and d is your friend if you prefer the traditional screen.  I think I may grow to enjoy windows 8.<br /><br />I would not recommend this download to anyone unless they call and confirm that it is working."
1215	0	I brought this with the thought that I was getting the state e file free. Well not only is it not free ($19.99) but when I printed it out it came with do not file printed across the front. So how am I to even mail that in?
1216	0	While I have used this for years, this year it did not seem as strong as before. I still plan to use it next year.
1217	-1	DON'T BUY 2015 version, WAIT FOR  2016 .......PER Mark L | Technical Support | Kaspersky Lab Americas &#34;I do apologize for the issues you are having with Kaspersky. In order to fix this issue with Kaspersky AVP spiking your CPU and slowing down your computer, you will need to downgrade to the 2014 version. This issue has been fixed in the 2016 version that will be released this summer, but we are still awaiting a fix for the 2015 version. Unfortunately, this does not appear imminent so doing the downgrade to 2014 is recommended
1218	1	Due to caregiving responsibilities and a death in the family, I am way behind on filing taxes. In 2015, I discovered I had not even purchased the software for 2012. Thank goodness Amazon had it available for download. I've used Turbo Tax for years, my only quibble is that some questions are not clear, and the help is not specific to the meaning of that question.
1219	-1	It works but it is very crude.  Since Apple decided that I needed to pay for an upgrade to use what I have I tried going to a Excel knock off.  This is a poor version by comparison to the old type.  Apple then decided that I could use the product that I already had after 3-4 days.  Real Nice.
1220	0	I ran into a glitch right at the end (after the e-file had even been accepted by my state, PA) and discovered that the tech support department does not have Mac's to test the program on -- although they would really, really like them. Thus they could not duplicate my error and I did email them a photo of the print out with the error which prompted a &#34;hey, you weren't kidding.&#34; Ultimately, I don't think it affected the return submitted to the state (but I guess I will have to wait to see if the Dept. of Revenue comes knocking).
1221	-1	They sold me this software, with an out-of-date product code.<br />I could not install the software.<br />Their customer service would not reply to my emails.<br />Disreputable.
1222	1	It's office.  It has word.  Excel is awesome.
1223	-1	No elastic voice
1224	-1	I have been happily using Quicken for over 10 years. I waited until the last minute possible before I HAD to upgrade from 2011 to 2014 to preserve my bank and CC connections. Quicken 2014 is UNSTABLE and has crashed at least 10 times on me. This is unacceptable. 2011 never crashed. I'm using Win 7 64. The program is noticeably slower than 2011 just switching screens and changing to different views. The session seems to get progressively slower as I use it and then the screen will start to have artifacts. Dialog boxes from a previous screen will persist, scroll bars stop working and then if freezes... HARD. I have to kill it from the services manager because I cant close it. I was prompted to write this review because I just spent an hour setting up a new budget when it froze. Relaunched it and all my work was gone. Come on Intuit, you gotta know about these problems. How about fixing them since we are basically forced to upgrade.<br /><br />Danny Milla
1225	1	I posted a seriously negative review, which, after WEEKS of interaction with Corel support turned out to be entirely due to problems on my computer (old hardware driver / old video players) not with the product, so this is a revision of it. The incompetence of their First Level support compounded the problem but their Second Level support found all of the issues and either fixed them or told me how to successfully fix them (the first level support either couldn't find them or gave me advice that just caused me to lose all my work without fixing anything).    The features are terrific. I'm working on an educational video and this easily lets me put in audio and video files in any order I like, edit them as I please (with LOTS of features beyond what I need), add a soundtrack and/or voice-over and so forth, and I can do that in segments and then piece the segments together into a final composite video.    I can't think of anything I want to do that it doesn't do.    The only flaw in the product that I can see is that the way it deals with the Windows file system is cumbersome at best and its own internal segment-naming for its various clips (e.g. sound track of tires squealing) is incredibly stupid and meaningless and changing them is VERY tedious because of the poor way it deals with the file system.
1226	0	get what you pay for... this is a teaser freebie for a paid product.  For just under 40 dollars you can upgrade for life.  the interface is clean and it works as ADVERTISED.  There in is the catch to the free product... advertisement supported.  Oh well  the price is right to see if one wants to watch the small screen on a computer.
1227	1	5 stars.
1228	-1	Don't buy this download if you will need to print 1099-Misc for your contractors.  The software is way complicated and the customer service sucks.  I was on chat with the customer service for 40 minutes and in the end they said they didn't know how to solve my issue (I needed help with printing 1099-Misc forms).    Wish me luck getting my money back.
1229	0	Did no sync properly with my US bank account. Support told me I had to contact US Bank to get them to disable the web express connect, contacted US Bank and they said it should be connected via web express connect and it is free, but the quicken software (new update) is the broken part. US Bank said they had no way/control over disconnecting it. Basically I had to start that file all over and not allow it to connect to US Bank in the 1st place, and just do manual uploads. It synced fine with my chase and amex accounts, as well as my student loans. Then I created a cash account for the cash I gave my wife, so she could enter transactions as she spent it. It worked great on her Samsung phone, but the andriod app doesn't quite work right on my OnePlus One. Before I started using quicken I was just using a spreadsheet to track all my spending. It was a lot simpler data wise, but it worked. I think I have it all figured out now, but it was a real drag to get it functioning so that it was actually useful for something. I tried to return it but amazon doesn't allow software returns, so I just stuck it out and now I am fairly satisfied with it.
1230	1	I downloaded the software and had our state and federal taxes filled within an hour, and my wife owns her own business so it was more than just a 1040EZ.
1231	1	I've been a Turbotax user for a long time, but I tried H&R Block this year simply because of the lower cost.  It worked smoothly and I was able to complete my tax return and quickly get my refund.
1232	1	I hesitated to buy this mainly because I did not know what it was.  I just kept saying, &#34;Photoshop is TOO expensive.  So I'll limp along with my old version.&#34;  When I found out Elements was a good subset of Photoshop (which is not what it appears by its name), I purchased it.  So far, everything I need to do to prep art for our organization web site is in Elements, at one fourth the cost!  Recommend to anyone who wants to &#34;Photoshop,&#34; but does not need to do as much as they did fabricating Obama's birth certificate.
1233	-1	Product has malicious malware encrypted in it.  DON'T Download.  Cost me a couple of hundred dollars to get PC fixed and Amazon does not refund software purchases.  Can't tell you how upset I am with Amazon and this product.
1234	1	It works doesn't cause problems, whats not to love. i finally did a download from amazon for the software, a little tricky but worth the savings. Remember to register at Kapersky.  On an old vista dell. i have use it for 3 years now and would not change. Online is less costly too and it works just fine so its a win win..  The Mfg site is costly but amazon gives a great price.
1235	0	"My 2009 version had timed out and I wasn't able to download from banks so I upgraded to 2012.<br />I updated some Schwab accounts and the program failed to recognize transactions that had already been entered, listing them as \\""new.\\"" Now a few of them were entered differently by me, but most were identical ones that had been previously downloaded.<br />I contacted Intuit support chat, which talked me through creating a new empty file and downloading to that. Now, starting from a brand new file, there were not only duplicates but triplicates! Quicken says it's Schwab's problem, but I 'm sure Schwab will say it's Quicken's."
1236	-1	"I tried to upgrade to Quicken 2014 in hopes of overcoming the numerous sync problems with 2013.  I downloaded to Acer tablet running Windows 8 Pro.  The program crashed repeatedly.  After a long chat with Intuit, they admitted that it won't work with tablets.  What???  It will work on a Windows 8 desktop but not a Windows 8 tablet??  What's the diff?  Had to go back to 2013 (better than nothing).  On the plus side, Amazon agreed to refund the purchase price (after a little \\""encouragement\\"").  This product is definitely not ready for prime time.  What a shame.  Note, my experience was with the \\""Home and Business\\"" version."
1237	-1	Probably the last year I use it.  It was ratherly costly compared to some other programs and web sites.
1238	0	Very expensive but the best option for a Mac user. The multiple levels of features are a scam for more money. For the most part the Suite edition has been good enough for me but I have missed some of the higher level features.
1239	0	this product may work better than some. Me myself didn't really need the upgrade. I bought it for the games. Which means I needed to set up a virtual PC. A virtual PC would seem to solve my gaming problems. Come to find out setting up a virtual PC should help with productivity programs that do not work on Windows 7, not games. Your computer is not allowed to use all of the video card capabilities with a virtual PC. At least that's what the conclusion I came to however I am not a computer expert. You should be able to run those old games on the version of Windows 7 you have now, just look on the Internet for a patch
1240	-1	did not get it to work. did not bother complaining
1241	1	The single best security software.
1242	0	"I purchased a brand new netbook with 4GB of ram.  I purchased Word Perfect for it (cheaper than MS Office) and it will not run.  I keep getting the message that this app cannot run on your PC. To find a version that can, check with the software publisher.\\"" I have contacted Amazon for a refund. Software that I cannot use is useless. Decided to try to install it again.  It installed the second time, but was a pain to do and took hours."
1243	-1	Quicken 2014 is absolutely horrible!!! Bug after bug after bug. I've tried to get my problems solved thru a chat session and two phone sessions with no luck (total time spent approximately 6 hours). I finally got one of the problems fixed no thanks to Quicken. Thank goodness I have Carbonite, they were able to fix one of my Quicken problems. I tried to register Quicken and it crashed. When I try to do a &#34;one step update&#34; it crashes.  When I click on &#34;Mobile & Alerts&#34; then &#34;Sync Now&#34; it crashes. I've had Quicken for about 7 years and this is the first year I've experienced problems.
1244	1	I've been using this program for years now and it gets better and easier. Talk you though everything and ask the right questions. Has audit checker and online filing. I rarely do anything by snail mail anymore. Fast turn around on my refunds. Great program.
1245	1	Thumbs up :)
1246	1	I would recommend this product to all my friends that have a computer<br />I haven't had any problems with product
