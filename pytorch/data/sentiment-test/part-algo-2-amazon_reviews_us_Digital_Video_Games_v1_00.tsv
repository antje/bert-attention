0	1	Outstanding
1	-1	This game is absolutely terrible, no one should ever buy this game. I love simulator games and especially train simulator games but this one is horrible. DO NOT BUY!!!
2	1	As I expected, I got the code, not from e-mail though.  Pretty nifty, and put this into my PlayStation account.  Five stars, thanks Sony!
3	-1	I downloaded this for my son only to find out it couldn't be used because the base version he purchased for Sims 3 was downloaded/installed from another site (Steam). Needless to say I wasted my money on this purchase. I think there should be some more clear options for how to download/install the correct versions of this kind of software.
4	0	Not as good as Jewel Quest II, consists of a lot of finding hidden objects, but is challenging and fun at times.
5	1	All three of these games are very good. Both civ games are gold edition which is GREAT. Xcom is pretty amazing too. (But I also got it on sale for $20 ;D)
6	-1	Man oh man where do I even begin with the disappointment BF3 has turned out to be! For almost a year I waited for this, drooling over the preview trailers. I was hoping for something that would continue the Battlefield tradition of grittiness and balanced gameplay, something that would take the movement and shooting mechanics of Bad Company 2 and elevate them with huge battlefields and tactical gameplay. Instead what I got was a something that makes even the running and gunning in Crysis 2 multiplayer look better than the gameplay delivered by BF3.  Origin and Battlelog are deal breakers in themselves, but my real problem is with the gameplay. The main beefs:  - The running speed is ridiculously high. It feels more like Quake than a modern military shooter.  - The weapons are all too similar in performance and their variety; most are variants of the US M16 and Russian AKXX families; gone are the exciting and fun and rewarding-to-master machine guns such as MG3 and XM8 LMG.  - The weapons and using them feels way more artificial than BC2. In Bad Company 2 the weapons feel more natural and fire in a more satisfying way. In BF3 the weapons are nowhere near as solid.  - Above all else, the enemy soldiers somehow seem much more difficult to spot, at any range. The environments are all oversaturated, and enemy soldiers are often hard to spot. It feels like playing a game of Where's Waldo most of the time.  Oh, and the single player totally, completely, sucks.  I hope that DICE go back to their roots and build a SOLID Bad Company 3, with great single player and continuing the weapons and shooting mechanics and movement mechanice and EVERYTHING of Bad Company 2, just ramping up the vehicular gameplay. And pleas DICE and EA, no more crap like Battlelog - let us play the game directly from within itself. It is no fun to launch the game over 60 seconds every time I start a new match.
7	1	Homefront: Short, sweet. Four hours could be worse spent, especially when acquired with this bundle.<br /><br />Stalker: Brilliant game. Atmospheric, difficult (at times), and very entertaining and memorable.<br /><br />Red Faction: Guerrilla: Destroy stuff. Have fun. Get bored after 15 hours because it grows a little repetitive.<br /><br />Red Faction: Armageddon: Grab magnet gun: make things smash into other things. Neat!<br /><br />Metro: See STALKER. Same idea, but linear instead of open world.
8	0	Update: 6/21/2016  I have taken this product from 1 to 3 stars. I was initially very irritated at this product because it seemed like the same product that has shipped for the past couple revisions of Simcity. I was just too harsh. After playing it for a while, it is still fun. Not as fun as it could be, but fun. The interface is graphically chunky and seems to be in the way alot. The game works, works well and is fun to play so I am giving it 3 stars. Its Ok. Thats about all I can say.<br />I have not played sim city since it was 2001 or whatever. This seems like the exact same game and same graphics. If i could send it back i would. I have regretted this purchase.
9	1	Got this for 30 dollars on Cyber Monday - so far it's been a great 30$ of entertainment.  Slight downside was the first expansion has to be forcibly downloaded even if you don't buy it.  I enjoy getting points for suppression fire, scouting and the small details such as scope glare.  Hackers using aimbot suck, but overall a good form of entertainment.
10	1	Great
11	-1	Was enjoying the play.  Was almost to the end and then got the blue screen of death.  Got rid of the game pretty quickly.
12	1	It's the tits.
13	-1	I clicked the MAC box instead of PC for download, and Amazon won't let me cancel or return it for the PC version. DON&#34;T do digital downloads from Amazon, they S#CK!
14	-1	I bought this as a mac download and it won't work on macs. Its locked to the terrible Origin download client (PC only).<br />If you want a mac game, nothing to see here... move along.
15	0	Very cheap game, but I don't know why I can't play on original game center
16	-1	I will have to chime in that the advertising here was unclear. I ScreenShot it, just in case it 'Eventually' Clears up, but there should have been 'Some' Limited Quantities warning on the Product if there was such a thing. Purchasing decisions were made based on the Advertised stop date, and that date was not held to. With a Physical Product, one expects this, but on Digital Content... one assumes they can just pay attention to sale dates. This is apparently not the case on Amazon, and shows how far they need to go before I can take them seriously as a Digital Product Marketplace. ;? Ahhh Well... there is always the Steam Summer Sale. ;P
17	0	Too many micro-transactions for courses that should either be cheaper in price or included with the base game.<br />The game also has a tendency to freeze when transitioning from one menu screen to the next.<br />The game of golf seems to be on par with previous releases.
18	1	I absolutely love these games, and they worked perfectly with my steam account. Great art direction, great plot and story, fun gameplay and characters. What more can be said. I would buy this twice if I could so I could share with a friend.
19	-1	There's no information on the Amazon page regarding the DRM used. Unfortunately it requires online internet activation in order to play.  [Edit] The description of the game on the Amazon page reads: DRM: None That's a COMPLETE LIE, since it still uses ONLINE ACTIVATION in order to play.
20	0	Personally it just didn't seem worth the buy. After having to deal with a lot of initial trouble, partially because of unhelpful FAQs, I just was pretty disappointed with the game. The graphics are pretty nice I guess, but I had GPS issues the whole time. At one time, I'm sure that I would have just loved this game. However, cheap nostalgia just isn't enough for me to subscribe. I would recommend it to anybody who likes any FF game they play regardless of how much it is actually worth.
21	1	Perfect, on time , convenient and keep on
22	1	3 month code is perfect for someone who needs to buy gold fast. If you are lucky you might find this product on sale. Be on the look out. You can buy this as a code, or physical code. The digital code is better because you do not have to wait for the item to come in the mail.
23	0	I had this game on Windows and it was my favorite game in the world... If you have Ubuntu/Linex, it will *not* work, even if you have Wine added... I am unable to play this game now on the computer because of that.
24	1	I remember back then I was paying this much for a 1-month membership. Definitely will be purchasing again, once this one is over on the 31st.
25	-1	I was excited for this expansion pack to come out because I was getting bored of the other ones. Man, the maps are really cool but they are absolutely not fun to play on because it caters to camping like nothing I've ever seen before. If you enjoy playing games where everyone is on top of a 20 story building then Aftermath is for you. If you're like me and actually like getting in firefights then don't even bother with this expansion. I've tried playing on numerous occasions but every time I play it's nothing but people sitting on rooftops sniping or sitting in some random corner in some random place waiting for somebody to walk by. I've seen this happen on every single game mode but Rush seems to be the only mode that doesn't have tons of roof and corner campers.<br /><br />I'd personally pass on buying this expansion unless you already have Premium like I do. If you don't own Premium I wouldn't bother with this expansion because I find it to be the worst of the 4 that are out.
26	0	Ok first off, I won't lie.  This is indeed a quality MMO game.  There are many fun things to fill many hours of your time in GW2, but that being said, it's not endless.<br /><br />After awhile you'll find that in spite of a few minor updates to the traditional MMO, this game is pretty much the same as most of them and without really compelling storylines to offset the &#34;another mmo&#34; feel to it, it does indeed end in boredom.  Granted if you don't expect a game to carry you through for the next several years and you're content with a few weeks or months, at best, before you start repeating things, then it is definitely a game worth the money.
27	1	I love this game! The freedom that once you buy this game you can always play it. I've been playing since my best friend and housemate introduced me and I've loved everyday i have played. I can't say enough. The graphics are stellar, the game play wonderful. The uniqueness of the Characters are the best!It's so much fun to play and I love that I play with my husband and even our oldest has played and loves it.
28	1	Perfect
29	-1	Uplay is just awful; they need to drop it already... even South Park didn't have Uplay integration (yes, I know that game came afterwards but nothing is stopping them from patching it out (e.g. GFWL removal from titles)).
30	-1	purchased and downloaded this earlier this year, while NBA season was in full swing.  Even then, it was difficult to get online with 2K and have chance to play any games against online opponents.  I sold by xbox 360 last year thinking that the PC version would be just as good and allow online matches.  That was a regrettable decision.<br /><br />The game would be 100% satisfactory if it was able to go online and have the same options as a console game.  By only being able to play locally with a friend or against the computer, the motivation to play is just not there.<br /><br />I received a notice for the 2K14 to be ready for download on Oct. 1... However, I am very leery and suspicious on the lack of follow through and ZERO communications from 2K.  Fool me once, shame on you, and fool me twice.. well you know.<br /><br />Advice for 2K: If you want huge sales and many people downloading 2K14 right away, you need to go overboard in addressing this lack of confidence in your services... You need to guarantee servies for at least 1 full year after purchase.... Not spotty service for few months and closing down connections for the remaining 6 months.  I bought a 2K13 that was good for several months of online play.. after that, no roster updates, no customer service.<br /><br />You guys are just not reliable.  Without reliable online play, I will stick with 2K12 or 2k13 for the occasional game against the computer.  I would play this daily and be addicted to it, if there was more competitive matches and ability to play against other PC players.
31	0	From all the commercials and reviews this game looks amazing, but ive been having super bad lag issues with it when I first purchased it. I havent loaded it up lately but maybe its good to go now. I would however suggest having a more than midlevel PC to run this game.
32	-1	There is a reason EA was voted worst company in America two years in a row.  The basic reason is that they view customers as cash cows to be milked at every opportunity, with no care whatsoever about the slop those cash cows are fed.  This version of SimCity has less content than any other ever, nothing online actually works, the patches aren't, the game mechanics are horrible, and if you are going to buy this heap of a game then god help your soul.
33	0	I bought this ages back when I still thought it was worth it, and still seems to be the best deal on xbox passes, but I've come to a point of being stomped on as a customer by microsoft where I think buying an xbox gold membership is a ripoff. If you must, buy on amazon, but if you're smart, don't pay to connect to a service that should be free.
34	-1	Like many of you I waited for months and months watching every teaser video and review I could find...and then...disaster.  And not the kind that can be cleaned up with a few firetrucks!  The launch was obviously a disaster as we saw almost nobody able to log on and play but then when finally getting on I found the bugs render the game almost unusable.  On OS X if you don't have a machine from this year then be prepared to scale back the detail immensely.
35	-1	I just download Football Manager 2012<br />I was so impatient to try it... But too bad, it work only with steam and my connection isn't fast.<br />After installing, there was no shortcut to launch the game !! I had to search it in Steam menu... But the connexion wasn't fast enought: lot of problem before being able to sign in...<br />And then I had to wait a loooooooot of time before because Steam had to prepare the game to be launch (why ????): Lost of time !!!<br />And then, I tought everything was ready, but Steam wanted to install updates for the game ! What updates ? I don't know ! I searched on net if there was updates. No updates on the official Football Manager website. Where did they found this updates ???  Just another way to loose time !!<br /><br />I had to wait the game to be updated !!!<br />Poor signal !! Lot of time lost, with frustration<br /><br />Amazon don't mention clearly Steam will be requiered to play it ! The wrote it only on the last line in additional info. It should be the first thing the buyer see.<br /><br />If you don't have a good connexion, don't buy it !<br />You 'll regret<br /><br />I already know that I won't be able to play Football Manger when the connexion is completly down: No net, no game !!<br /><br />frustrating !!
36	-1	So, spend money and get what...nothing! Oh wait, hours of frustration and anger, guess I could have done that for free!<br /><br />This is crap, it won't even give me the option to CONNECT to a server. I am actually at the point where I do not want to buy another EA game again. Unfortunately I can't get a refund on this because I got a digital download. Next time, I'll just flush my money down the toilet, at least then I can have fun watching it swirl.
37	-1	They should have anticipated the popularity of this deal. Horribly done. Then they offer us these stupid 25% off codes instead...
38	1	That was the game series I  had been looking for, and it works very well.
39	0	Worried too much about the mods and not the game.  It was a huge detraction for me.
40	0	Hate the slow dream flashback like sequences, they interrupt game play. Save your money people, this game isn't worth it.
41	0	Download stated that it loaded fine.  When I went to run the program, I didn't find it and then I went to the Control Panel and  it was not in the Program listing.  I went back and tried to load it again.  The download blinks and nothing happens.  I tried the  troubleshooting suggestions and nothing worked.  I just wasted 7 bucks.    BUT -  The download software got confused 'I think'.  I bought a copy for one computer and another copy for my laptop.   I think  the download thought it was loading to the same computer as my first purchase and therefore stated it was complete.   For some reason  I got the instruction to load the 'downloader software' again and I did so.  Then it loaded the game directly on my laptop and it works  just fine.  DELL INSPIRATION LAPTOP USING VISTA.    So I didn't lose my 7 bucks after all.  Using the game for a New Years Party and it seems to display nicely when the laptop is hooked up  to a large screen TV.
42	-1	Bummer - but I got the 404 Error as did a reviewer before me.  So.  No playing.  Not sure whether it will re-discover its file location later on, but will try again.  One more time.  And that's all.
43	0	Graphics a bit disappointing. Wish there were better backgrounds and tile sets.  If you just like to play mah jong, this is for you.
44	1	&#60;3 oldskool
45	-1	Wasted time when Trion is a joke.
46	1	Excellent and amazing quick. The Pass was provided immediately and it even allowed me to pull up the code (in case, I didn't have a pen and paper or I was not near my console). The Destiny DLC is a must OWN for all destiny fans.
47	0	I'm an avid city builder fan. I put this one above average for this type. Up there with Children of the Nile and Civ City Rome and the like.<br /><br />The only con I can think of is, When you click on an individual, it would be nice to have the camera auto follow him/her.
48	1	Gg
49	0	I'm going to start off this review by saying, what Wargaming Inc has created here is more or less a highly nuanced and cleverly constructed scam. The game itself is free, so what you get is a team based 3D action game with some interesting (albeit not fully balanced) mechanics and a persistent progression through fighting battles that guides you along the tanks and equipment in the order they were developed before, during, and after WWII. The matches are random, and you only have the option to team up with one other friend in a match without paying money. The graphics are okay, but beyond the highly detailed tanks, they are pretty primitive. Also, the production values are astoundingly bad. Everything from voicework to sound effects is amateur at best. However, if you're a tank enthusiast, you will be extremely addicted to this game, as the tanks' capabilities versus eachother are more or less historically accurate. Aiming is done in an unrealistic and arcade manner, but the ballistics and penetration physics are pretty authentic.<br /><br />Describing how this game is a total scam is difficult, and that's where Wargaming's genius comes out. Essentially, you won't have fun playing unless you pay... a lot. At first paying is unnecessary, but once you get a grasp for the game balance, you'll have shovel out at least 7 bucks a week if you want to continue progressing. The rate at which you progress through tanks is glacial without an xp booster, and even then it will take you months of playing every day to make it down a nation's tech tree. Add to that every time you receive a new tank, it will be furnished with the worst possible equipment available for the tank, and you're stuck with that equipment until you generate enough xp for that tank and upgrade it's equipment. Additionally, the tank's crew must be retrained every time they move to a new tank which means unless you pay, you'll have to operate the tank at 75 percent efficiency until they finally level back up to 100. There is the option to have a tank generate XP that can be used on another tank in order for the user to avoid playing a tank with stock equipment, however you must spend a good deal of money to transfer the XP over, and this is the core of WoT's scam. Conceivably you could pick a favorite tank and have it generate enough XP and in-game credits for you to run through an entire nation's tech tree and have fun doing it. But the amount of money you'd have to spend is astronomical. This is the type of game that has no problem asking you to pay upwards of 100 bucks to do anything mildly significant. If you want to play player made matches with friends, you have to pay. If you want to play in a clan game, you have to pay. If you want to team up with more than one friend in a public match, you have to pay.<br /><br />Of course it all comes down to whether or not you think it's worth it. It's a pretty fun game, but with the horrible production values, long unresolved balance issues, and the existence of other F2P games such as Tribes: Ascend and Planetside 2 which require significantly less money to be invested for a good time; it's hard to recommend this game.
50	0	Like playing a movie. Kills whatever fun it could be.<br />I doubt I'll finish it.
51	1	Code works great and at a good price.
52	-1	I played this for about five minutes and then quit...the control are absolutely horrible and make the game virtually unplayable.
53	-1	I could never get it to download so I have no idea whether it's good or not. Will not re recommend downloading from your site!!
54	1	This game is no where near as fun as Shining Force I. It should be noted that the first game of this series is not Shining Force I it's Shining in the Darkness. I hope to obtain more games to compare them.I've played Shining Force I since i was a child so it's hard for me to get used to this other one.
55	1	Having purchased two digital codes for our family(the first during a special promotion/sale) with no problems of delivery...I'm a happy camper :)
56	0	I really liked the game but mine must have had a glitch in it as I couldn't get past the mansion for the rich guy. I was in the yard and was supposed to start cutting strap on umbrella and cut down a post. After getting the handle for the umbrella couldn't get any further. I was really bummed out. Also not sure if I want to try and download again as my firewall stopped a trojan after I was playing it. Don't know if it came from the game but I wasn't anywhere else that was new.
57	0	This game is like a lot of other Amazon games - do a lot of tasks in a short period of time. While normally I like this kind of thing, this one was kinda repetitive. It also kept freezing my graphics driver, so I ended up uninstalling it after a day or two (I have vista, so it should have worked fine). If you're REALLY into repetition, go ahead and download, otherwise skip this one.
58	-1	I was really enjoying this one until it froze up on me.  I exited out and tried again.  Same problem.  I tried being a different player and it froze at the same spot.  I am going to try uninstalling and reinstalling the product and see if that works.  Will let you know.
59	-1	I was hoping for combat, much more out of the game. I am ex-navy and this one came up short.
60	0	I found this game to be a little boring.  There was nothing to do, but look for objects, and complete mini games between levels.  I found the mini games boring or too difficult.  The story was not very interesting and didn't really seem to play a big part in the gameplay.  Overall, I was not very satisfied with this purchase.  I didn't even finish the game.  I uninstalled it and downloaded a different game.
61	-1	I installed this and within minutes was bombarded by malware and pop-ups.  It took two days to cleanse my computer of the garbage it let loose.  Stay far away from this bomb!
62	0	This item pack for the Sims 3, will only be of value to the most hardcore Sims 3 fan.  The items are okay but nothing fabulous. If you really want to know if buying this is in your interests then consider how much you typically spend on the Sims 3 store.  Do you buy items on a regular basis?  If you do then this might be a good value for you.  All together, you would pay about $35 for the items if you bought them all through the store.  You can get this for around $20. There is some value there but you'd have to do your research to know if you should buy it or not.
63	-1	with my misspent youth sat in arcades bunking school and playing Mortal kombat i was somewhat eager to play it...<br />not because i wanted the same experience - more because i was hoping they had updated it, added some hd'ness to it etc etc...<br /><br />sadly - its unresponsive, not fit for modern screens, and looks like crap.<br /><br />it cost me a few quid - but believe me - i want my money back.<br /><br />I was going to buy the newest version of MK.... but after playing this tosh - i will save my money for an years subscription to a magazine...<br /><br />it will be far more enjoyable!
64	0	The game is very tame (read boring ) and in order to play tge downloaded copy you have to keep another application running.  Not what i expected.
65	0	Yea after call back 3 times becouse the code were used
66	1	This is more fun to play on my kindle (bigger screen) than on my DS!  Same game and EZ relaxed play action.
67	0	Its good but thes MOST be a 5$ PSN card!
68	-1	The code did not release the currency in the game. Poor buy.
69	1	This is simply online credit for OUYA games.  The code worked so the product works.  If you own an OUYA and don't want to give them your credit card this is for you.
70	-1	I cannot download the game.....
71	0	I purchased the game for a much reduced rate, so not a lot I can complain about.  The game has decent graphics and is well made, but the keyboard controls are a challenge in places.  Ok for what it is I guess.
72	-1	I downloaded the demo to try out the game before buying.  I'm glad that I did.  The controls were on some sort of delay.  That means when, for instance, I pressed the arrow key to turn, it took at least 1-2 seconds for the car on the screen to make the movement.  Sometimes pushing a button does nothing.  Even on the menu screen, when I push the enter button to select something it does not respond, and I have to push that button several times before it does actually register in the game.  The same thing happens in the game and makes for a lousy if not impossible gaming experience.  Also, the gameplay was choppy.  Again, that means that the action would be slow, then all of a sudden, it would jump ahead, then slow down, then jump, and so on.  Maybe this is just my computer, but most games do not run like that.  Also, the steering is overly sensitive, (when it actually responds).  For instance, when the car is moving down the road, and I try to steer it just a little, with a quick tap of the arrow key, it jumps 15-20 degrees to the side.  Along with all the other problems, this makes controlling the car/truck aggravating and just not worth playing the game at all.
73	1	Ordered the online game code and it was in my e-mail inbox within 2 minutes after the order confirmation.
74	1	I am a sims fan and I love their games, including this one. I am constantly finding new things in the game. Even though it is taking me a little while to understand everything in the game, I do not play it every day, but when I do I find fun things and so much more. I am having a lot of fun with this game. =)
75	-1	This game does not support my logitech game pad. I would give it 0 stars if i could! It has had 0 patches so i assume they are not going to fix it.
76	-1	I have not been able to get it to download properly so have not been able to use it.  Tried 10 times and gave up.....worthless
77	1	The only way to get Xbox points with ever having to leave your living room. I will no longer buy points directly from Microsoft.
78	0	Since I played this game with alteriwnet, I loved, mods are great, graphics are perfect, excelent gameplay in MP, so I take the offer and I bought it.  I was so exited when installed, but STEAM . . . mmm no matter, I already have some few games under this platform.  But when I ran the game in MULTIPLAYER MODE, I notice that SERVER BROWSER NO EXISTS at all, this a FAIL feature, because we have to wait for joining to a random game, so, there is no way to play with friends.
79	0	I want to state that I downloaded this game from Amazon. There were no problems with the download, but the game is horrible. It is repetitive and seems never ending.
80	0	I am an advanced game user so it's not like I don't know what I'm doing, but if you get this game don't ever use the security feature that has the game send you a code to your phone. The feature doesn't work as intended and then you have to deal with customer service which is slow and acts like you are wasting their time.
81	-1	Its a fun expansion pack. I did enjoy it when i could play it. Only problem was on EA's end. Island paradise kept freezing every few seconds after i installed it. EA is aware of this. i had to uninstall it just to play the other ones without my game freezing up. For this reason i give it a 1 star.
82	0	The game is amazing and gets 5 stars. The download itself gets only 3. During download it caused my computer to freak out and my screen turned blue and shut down. As of now everything seems to be fine and the game is running great but the problems during download are a pain to deal with.<br /><br />I have had some issues with my computer in the past when downloading certain software so this could have more to do with my computer rather then the download itself.
83	1	When I called customer support with Bioware, they informed me that I had made too many purchases for cartel coins and so the game was locking me down because it thought something was up. It did this when I was preparing to transfer a character to another server to play with my friends without having to level a brand new character, so it was a bit of an annoyance.<br /><br />The person on the customer service line told me that if I needed the cartel coins right away, then I could purchase them from Amazon.com (and they even admitted that's what they do, which I thought was awesome xD).<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing more coins from Amazon now, however, rather than from the cartel coins shop Bioware provides. Why? Because if you purchase cartel coins from Amazon, you will get a pet included from Amazon as a thank you for purchasing said coins from them. It will come in mail to every character you create. Right now, I have a pet TIE model (not sure what the name of it is off the top of my head), and if there's a chance of getting more neat pets like that in the game as a result of my purchase... then SIGN ME UP!<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
84	0	If you want to play a game,<br />You better not be lame!<br /><br />It's a poem about a ten of paper card who cares!
85	0	It's not very fun really... Hard to control.  But it was free so I wanted to try it.  Second Life coming to amazon will be the death of my wallet.
86	-1	I read all the horrible reviews and hoped for the best, but the game does not work, starting when you install it. Don't buy this game, it's a horrible waste of anybody's money.
87	0	I liked this game, it was just like the other CSI games. I don't like all those other shoot-up games, so these are easy and fun. I don't like the fact that you have to follow a certain path in order complete the game successfully. Yes, sometimes I have to use the cheat codes because I really hate repeating a game several times to complete it just cause I forget to click on one area.
88	-1	I can not get it to play on my computer.  Had the game on PS3 and it was good, but I ordered the pc download and have no luck, very sad!!
89	0	I am an absolute Sims fanatic.<br /><br />Personally this game was a nice little addition but definitely not worth the price. I think this game is worth the price of a &#34;Stuff&#34; pack...not an expansion pack. I would definitely hold off until the price decreases if you really want this game.<br /><br />It just wasn't that exciting.<br /><br />In other news, I had no issues downloading with the online code. My origin is up to date and original Sims game wasn't through origin. If this is the case, you have to re-download it, which origin makes really easy by not requiring your game code again. My ONLY complaint about downloading online Sims games, is the speed is ridiculously slow. I bought the game and couldn't play for like 2 more hours waiting for origin. :/ My laptop is brand new, and my wifi is strong. Origin is just buggy.<br /><br />Hope this helped!
90	1	I bought this card to give as a gift to a nephew of mine. He is very happy with the games available on PSN Plus. I liked the low price of Amazon.
91	1	This is a great game, and one that's completely addictive.  The object is to clear paths from your castle as you move onward through the kingdom.  You'll travel through different sorts of environments, such as deserts, swamps, and polar villages.  Along the way you have to erect buildings to produce necessary resources, and finish in the time allotted.  By all means play the trial, you may very well find yourself addicted too.
92	0	Great gameplay, but as buggy as the weeks after launch, I had to write two support ticket responses to Amazon to get my preorder battle pack.<br /><br />Amazon were fairly prompt in response, but nobody should have to do this stuff when you're shelling out $60 for a premier game.
93	1	I've really enjoyed this.  I had completely forgotten how to play cribbage and also how much I enjoyed the game.  This is just perfect for beginners or old pros.  Worth every penny.  (It works on XP & on my new Windows 8.1 laptop).  Have fun.
94	1	Glitches in fight scenes, dont let that stop you because it has great story telling and its a choose your own adventure.
95	0	This game is almost like a step backward for this franchise. They for some reason abandoned several good things they had going in version 2.
96	0	FEAR 2 pales in comparison to the first game.<br />The game experience is marred by the accuracy of two particular weapons.<br />The assault rifle and the SMG. That said, there are times when an overwhelming amount of ammo must be directed at your opposition. It makes the experience rather frustrating. The reload cinematic on the rifle is this open-hand slap against the receiver after a fresh mag is inserted into the gun.<br />When your ass is being engaged and torn apart by a large dose of enemy fire, you'll be wishing that this unnecessary little reload gimmick wasn't there and same goes for this sideway-burst muzzle flash.<br />Sure, it's just a game. It's an FPS. Well, there are those of us that look toward a certain amount &#34;accuracy&#34; within these games.
97	-1	Just not what I expected from SimCity.
98	1	Sonic 4 ditches Sonic's friends in favor of just playing as Sonic just like in the original game on Sega Genesis. You get four zones which are loosely based on Emerald Zone(Sonic 2), Casino Zone(Sonic 2), Metropolis Zone(Sonic 2) and Labyrinth Zone(Sonic 1). It's sorta of an HD remake of the previous Sonic levels but each of them has a different twist on it. Special Stages are from the original Sonic The Hedgehog game but instead of controlling Sonic you rotate your controller or use the d-pad to rotate the stage to make Sonic move. Alot of the bosses at the end of the stages are from the original games. I am not gonna spoil which bosses they are but if you played the Genesis games you can pretty much guess. The last stage is pretty hard in my opinion, you face each of the bosses before facing Robotnik in the final stage. Its alot like the Mega Man games facing all of the robot masters. I can't wait for Episode 2 to come out next year. Its a great game for $14.99 kinda short but if your looking for a 2D Sonic game this is for you. I did have a few issues and that's Sonic doesn't move as fast as he did in the Genesis games, he moves like he has weight added to him and has a homing attack that locks on enemies. He has to built up speed to run and the controls seem kinda stiff.
99	1	Loved the game. You get to decorate cakes and decide on cakes and usualy the delivery man or the critic will pick up your design. Gets difficult, but thats what makes it fun. I played the 1st time and upgraded everything at once; I could not finish the game that way. Upgrade as you feel neccesary, not what they tell you. I will download all Cake Manias and review each one. It's a fun way to beat the clock. I'm a Cake Mania addict!
100	0	Free game for PS4  its disaster , discounts exellent
101	-1	A good single-player experience, but be warned that there is ZERO SUPPORT for multiplayer. Use your best discretion... and probably don't buy this.
102	0	Excellent graphics, gameplay mechanics are awesome. However there are<br />Several minor glitches that can ruin entire games. Specifically, AI glitches. I am currently stuck on the fountain of youth level because my ground infantry are often unresponsive when I tell them to attack. They simply don't move when I issue the attack command. Yet they will move if I issue the move command. The AI can also be oblivious and unresponsive to enemy AI near by. This is generally only an issue in the campaign mode.<br /><br />Skirmish mode works great. So beware - small glitches like this ruin what could have been a great game . So I would recommend this game, but your experience may be dampened significantly by the terrible AI.
103	0	I've played plenty of casual games. This is the most casual of them all. When you play Flower, you feel like you are in a screensaver with soothing music, pretty sounds, and relaxing graphics. Flower would be worth using for meditation, but it just barely crosses the bar from relaxing to mildly annoying.<br /><br />Chances are you'll get bored after five minutes. Three months later, you'll play it for another five minutes. Then again, it might be good for the kids. Or grandma.
104	1	Amazing game, very well put together, expands the story and makes it fun all over again, can not beat it for the price
105	0	Now dont get me wrong, I play ALOT of older games. Sadly, Thief does not maintain the luster it had back when it was released. The control scheme is difficult if youre more used to the wasd key- based movement. Many times i would attempt to sidestep away from an enemy's sword and instead do a turnabout so i could take the blow in my back. I became increasingly frustrated with it. The graphics are still acceptable though, and the level design piqued my interest for exploration. The game is also very difficult, which i find satisfying due to my constant want of a challenging game. If youre interested in a dated sneak/stealth game, maybe Thief will be worth a try.
106	-1	I was looking for a double deck pinochle game. This one is single deck and useless to me
107	-1	from the description, I thought it would be more interesting. it's idiotic to make us write more when we don't like something.
108	0	I like the fact you can dispatch little units to little crime scenes but the game world is SOO BIG its hard to maintain.
109	-1	code didn't work - make sure they snail mail you your card otherwise if you have a problem you cannot and will not get your money back.  amazon & sony will not help you.  numerous people out there are using emailed fake codes for money laundering purposes!  BEWARE!
110	1	Easy download! I got the code (no need to download whatever it is they give you as the code is right there!)
111	1	Super worth it. It added so many options and supplies to my game. Especially the resorts, and mermaids, Recommended! Can't wait till sims 4
112	0	'Spore' by, far, is a game that I am really into, but it does have a lot of difficulty running on the new Windows 8.1 package. I have had the product for many months now, and even with the new 5.1 patch, I am still running into problems. System crashes are common, and someof the different levels that are available on it do not hold up. For instance, on the Creature Stage (Level II in the Evolutionary Plane), my game kept continually crashing and I would have to srttart over aggain after I attacked another species or was being attacked. It was also doing the same on the Gaalctic Stage when I was exploring other planets or ended up in a conflict. While I love the program, these bugs have never been truly resolved. Either EA or Origin needs to keep their customer staisfied with theri products (where OLD or NEW) or they wiull definitely end up losing a lot of sales. While this program may be older, they need to resolve the compatibility issues between platforms so that the game rtuns more smoothly.
113	-1	I bought this bundle pack for five dollars, thinking that this would be a good deal. But I was wrong. Let me explain: I own a windows 7 laptop that will be a year old in June. The games do not work at all on this laptop, which makes me frustrated because I paid for a game that doesn't work. When I read other reviews about the problem, I thought that it might have been a problem with certain computers. But now I'm sure that they need to fix it (steam company is the company you're getting the game from) before they should sell it. please do not buy this game if you have a new laptop or desktop. But if you do, make sure it's been fixed before you purchase.
114	0	As a fan of the original Manhunt, I was pretty excited to try out Manhunt 2, especially after all the press it got and the controversy that it evoked. In fact, Amazon is currently the only place you can still legally buy Manhunt 2 in it's original, uncut, AO rated form.<br /><br />Although it is a sequel to the first, Manhunt 2 has nothing to do with the plot of the previous game. Instead, it follows Daniel Lamb and Leo Kasper, two ex-members of a mysterious project called...well &#34;The Project.&#34; A+ for creativity there. As you progress through the game, you uncover more back story about their involvement and generally what is going on. Without spoiling anything, it follows a relatively twisted story arc, but it's nothing you've never seen before in terms of ideas.<br /><br />Then again, you didn't become interested in Manhunt 2 for the story. You want to see some gore, and in that regard you will get that. The executions are more varied than in the original Manhunt, now including environmental kills and gun executions not seen before in addition to the 3 levels of standard executions. There also is a bit more variety in weapons this time around, which helps keep things from becoming stale and boring. However, if you thought that the first Manhunt had too much gun-play too early, Manhunt 2 is even worse. Guns become very central to the game about 1/3 in, and it's still as awkward as ever.<br /><br />One thing that they did for reasons beyond me is that you cannot change the individual keys of the control scheme at all. Instead, you basically choose between having all the keys in a relatively standard setup, or moving things over to the number pad. There also is no controller support, so basically you are fixed into the games way of doing things. Also, speaking of control, you cannot look up or down unless you're aiming a gun. This makes movement feel very restrictive because, well, it is! It makes spotting enemies or objects that or above or below you nearly impossible sometimes in addition to just feeling wrong.<br /><br />The game is also substantially shorter than the original Manhunt. Not counting bonus levels, the first one had 20 stages, while Manhunt 2 has 15. They also are shorter in length, and while it took me about 18 hours to get through Manhunt, all re-tries included, Manhunt 2 took me less than 7.<br /><br />The gameplay on the surface look very similar, but it's very different when you actually play.  Manhunt was so hard (sometimes fairly, sometimes not) that I had to rage quit multiple times. Manhunt 2, on the other hand, is so much easier that I actually only died 4 times in the whole story. This is mostly thanks to the fact that damage has been greatly reduced to you, the player, while it's much more deadly on your enemies. This is most evident with gunplay, as with the first Manhunt, you could be mowed down in seconds by a submachine gun or assault rifle. Now, you can practically go Terminator on your enemies and soak up bullets like it was your business. There are even more painkillers than previously, and enemies drop them more often. On top of all this, checkpoints are much closer together, so you don't have to worry as much about dying. What this adds up to is that Manhunt 2 is much more forgiving than the original, but it feels too easy.<br /><br />The last criticism I have for Manhunt 2 is the lack of variety in enemies. There are only two common gangs that wear their own unique costumes, and the rest of the enemies are cops, militia men, or a few other gangs which make VERY short appearances, usually less than one level. One thing that made Manhunt interesting was all the different enemies, and it's sad to see that gone to.<br /><br />Although I have bashed this game pretty badly, I actually still recommend it to anyone interested in it. The executions are interesting enough to keep you playing, and it's worth checking out simply as a piece of history, much like movies such as Birth of a Nation.Since this is also the last legal place to get the AO game, you might want to hop on it before it's too late.
115	-1	I've played this game before. It's a cute game.  However, I downloaded it here and the program won't launch.  Have tried all the troubleshooting and requested a refund.
116	-1	it did not download correctly with my computer so i am out that money i paid for it so not to happy
117	0	Big disappointment with this costume package only because the costume package code i was sent was for the wrong package.  Instead of costume kit 2, I believe I was sent costume kit 1.  While still a great deal for the price, it was not what I ordered.  I sent an inquiry to amazon regarding the mix-up and received ZERO response.
118	0	This is also a very small download file. It is a bit of a challenge to play due to the reaction of one's arrow movements.
119	-1	Fraud - I didn't purchase this.
120	0	"The game graphics are nice. The spells are nice. Running back and forth over and over to do quests is kind of lame. I only played for a few days before I got hacked. Now I am trying to register my game with my square enix account and cannot do it. I don't know where in the world the registration is. It says \\""In order to register a game, please insert here the code you can find in either the game manual or the SQUARE ENIX MEMBERS leaflet found in your game box.\\"" However I did a digital download. My activation key doesn't fit so I am at a total loss. Their service seems pretty bad. After all they were horribly off on figuring out how much server space they would need and with how easily I got hacked I might be just kissing my $$ goodbye and not playing this game further."
121	0	This change from 'points' to real money was supposed to be no big deal in a gamer's world, however, what they didn't explain clearly is that tax is removed from the value of the new 'gift card'.  My sons are long time gamers and were have purchased more microsoft points than I ever imagined we would.<br />In the past the value of the card was XX dollars for XX points.  Very straightforward and easy for them to determine how many points they need to purchase for the options the want.<br />Now we just completed our first and then second 'gift card' online code purchase because, after purchase tax was deducted from the gift card, leaving less than what was need for the options.<br />This is a sneaky way for Microsoft to raise the price of the virtual points without actually admitting it.  I call that sketchy at best.  My sons work hard and save their money for the things they want.  We all learned lesson tonight.
122	1	good
123	1	the mechromancer adds in lots of extra gameplay with a totally new character that feels new and not like a reskin which all to often these &#34;new characters&#34; are.
124	-1	I'm not sure how to review this game without spoiling much of it so let me simply say that this game is good for passing the time aways but there really isn't much point in it.  If you hate losing then BUY THIS GAME because you really can't lose.  The fact is, you either figure out what you are supposed to do next or you just walk around aimlessly until you do.  It's not like you can die or anything.  Sure, there is some skill and brain teasers involved from time to time but you'll either figure it out, cheat and look up a walk through site or simply put the game away for a while and come back to it later when you're bored or something.  What else can I say?  Great graphics, difficult puzzles but overall, just a way to pass the time when there is nothing better to do.  I've certainly played worse.
125	0	"I played this game once all the way through and haven't really played it since. It is a fun game the first time through, trying to get all the awards and trophies, but after that it lost its appeal.<br />If you enjoy the sim-style games, this one is pretty fun for a while. The object of the game is to plant crops, raise some small farm animals, and make a profit. You collect various awards and trophies for reaching different milestones. After 30 \\""days\\"" in the game the score isn't really kept anymore, and it gets pretty monotonous."
126	0	Same game as the others. There is not much new to keep you entertained. If you liked the other two you will like this one.
127	-1	Poucos jogos para download e quando a assinatura expira os jogos full param de funcionar.<br /><br />Por isso não aprovo. .
128	0	Playing any sports game on the computer is generally annoying and crappy if you don't have a controller. Fortunately, I have two. I can also output my computer to the TV so this made for some console-like battles between friends in the same room. The stats, players and teams seem to all be accurate but I'm not THAT into soccer so I'm not sure. The difficulty of the game is a bit insane though. The plethora of moves and shots are hard to memorize and truly mastering aiming was extremely difficult to me (I never could get as good as I thought I should be). All in all, it was a fun game that my girlfriend and I enjoyed playing, was it worth the $50  or $60 I paid for it? Not being a soccer enthusiast, I would say not really. At a cheaper price point or for an enthusiast, definitely would be worth it.
129	-1	keeps crashing on windows 8.1
130	-1	The game saves are rediculous....like you never know when so you are continuousily starting again or doing the same thing over ond over.Why don't they fix this? I read about it in the forums and no one is happy about it.
131	-1	I was very disappointed when my code i purchased did not work. I canceled my monthly renewal, just to find out the deal was too good to be true!
132	0	It's all you can expect, but I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE BUY IT NOW CREDIT CARD THING! I used a gift card and it wouldn't let me get it. I had the money. Could someone please change that?
133	-1	Sadly, the thousands of reviews are correct.  This is not a good Sim City game and this is not a very good game at all.  The fact that the cities are extremely small yet require an extraordinary amount of granular management is frustrating.  It fails to be realistic or &#34;fantastic&#34; and just comes across as hobbled due to technical limitations and a lack of imagination.  As a HUGE Sim City fan, I wanted to believe that these issues would not affect my opinion of the game but they do.  As it stands, the final product is just not fun to play and the cities you are able to create are not attractive or realistic.  A sad day for all Sim City fans.  I hope Maxis *cough* EA gets its act together and creates a game more in keeping with Sim City 2000 and 3000, which remain the ultimate installments in my opinion.
134	0	and it shows.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />It looks amazing on full settings.<br />The level of zoom and camera angles let you join your sims on the streets, or appreciate an industrial fire.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The games Glassbox engine is not working properly. The simulation is unstable.<br />You may loose all your progress at random and be booted out to the main menu.<br />Server issues are still present.<br />Forget about multiplayer with stragers. All spots on all maps are always taken.<br /><br />Closing comment:<br /><br />The Maxis team had a great idea, and once it's working as it should be the best Simcity.<br />Sadly, it is not there yet, and it may be a while for them to get there.<br />Lastly if you're thinking of buying it; I suggest you keep track of the game on the official forums and purchase it after everything is fixed... or just move on with your life.
135	1	A very nice continuation from the cupcake cafe.  If you enjoyed that game you will definitely like this little sequel.  The addition of dogs is a nice little touch.  Also, you have the ability to design and upgrade the shop in new and inventive way.  I enjoyed the addition of the fry grill and think it helped add a bit more of a challenge to the overall gameplay.  Again, it's nothing spectacular or excessively difficult or complex, but will provide hours of entertainment.  I recommend it for anyone who enjoys games similar to the Diner Dash series.
136	1	Good replay value. Campaign is a bit short but the game is super fun online and provides great graphics on a good computer.
137	0	bad
138	-1	Remember Battle field 4? yeah this is the new Battle field
139	-1	"It runs horribly and has to be kept at the lowest resolution to run smoothly. Check the Steam forums for numerous complaints. There's an update coming in \\""2-3\\"" months that may fix it, but for now, this is a waste of money."
140	1	After 700 hours of playing this beautiful game.. YES! BUY IT.<br />Just don't forget to install DSFix.<br />And use a controller.
141	1	One of the better RPG
142	0	This game is fun, but it's really hard. I tried to pass all the levels with gold status and there was no way. Then I tried to pass all the levels with silver status and I couldn't do that either. A few of the levels are barely passable with the lowest passing score. I'm not sure why there is so much inconsistency with the difficulty of the levels, but either way, I managed to get through the game and it was fun. But...it took like three weeks. Usually I get through a game in one to three days. This is a decent, fun game to play if you just want to have a good time. But to try to get the high scores is extremely frustrating.
143	-1	My buddy and myself ran around for 40 minutes trying to die. We really wanted the heart palpitations and unease, and had to resort to watching a play through (manned by a complete putz) in order to find death. No exaggeration.<br /><br />The bar is too damn high these days and this game does not clear it.
144	-1	The best thing this game has going for it are its graphics.  They're, overall, crisply rendered and interesting.  As for the game play, it's extremely 'hand-holdie', meaning that you're mostly not given the opportunity to really figure anything out. Clues are constantly flashing to lead you directly to where an object is hidden, where you should angle the camera, etc.  Also, they're no consequences for using a hint (they're innumerable) or for letting the clock run. There's absolutely nothing at or to risk here.  I'd mostly recommend this to the very young, or to anyone who's interested in spending just under $7 to see if they can finish it in under 2 hours.  Trust me, it can be done.
145	-1	this game no longer works due to lack of support. I purchased it and downloaded it but it wouldnt run do to lack of servers.
146	1	Fun fast paced game, runs great with my nvidia gtx 780.  Only complaint is the smart pistol.
147	1	Everything is perfect, works awesomely.
148	-1	This is stupid to set for minute after minute while a computer simulates thinking. The way the match times are set up do not work well and you forfeit a match that you clearly won. The training is for children.
149	-1	this game didn't give adequate quality hints. The progress didn't save when you quit and go back later. I had to start over again.
150	0	DESPITE IT BEING SOMEWHAT INCONVENIENT TO HANDLE ALL PURCHASES W/ PS STORE USING ONLY PS GIFT CARD, IT'S OK NOW!
151	-1	I have not been able to install the game due to Amazon's game installer.  Even the Geek Squad cannot get it to work correctly on my computer so it's a problem.
152	1	Code reçu aussitôt  c est parfait
153	1	Great game!
154	0	It is a so so game, not the best and not that crap!<br /><br />But for the price I am paying for (under £5) is worth the buy to play with mates, I pre ordered this regretting (paying full price)<br /><br />It is quite fun when playing with mates, the gun effects as always sensational.<br /><br />Ai is pretty poor and graphics...well we all got tricked before the pre orders lol<br /><br />why oh why!<br /><br />The Alien universe has everything to make it a great game but Sega messed it up...really bad<br /><br />They lied and did not clean it up...unlike companies like Sony or Ms who will try their best to recover from wrong moves...
155	0	The game can be completely controlled by either mouse or keyboard. Whoever is responsible for this interface, congratulations. The game's platform is great.  The Dwarf origin story presents an interesting culture, one that worships its paragons, and this origin story is worth playing. I also give the game credit for coming up with a druid I can like.  But I hate this game's narrator. Dragon Age is a bromide. Most of it feels irritatingly familiar. The Darkspawn are orcs. The blight is Sauron's war. The Chantry is the Catholic Church. The elves are Jews. The Brecilian forest is Fangorn and the Grand Oak is an Ent. The Grey Wardens are Witchers.  It's interesting to compare this game's narrator to that of the far more imaginative Planescape: Torment. Torment uses dialogue options for a narrative purpose--if there's an interesting dialogue option that wouldn't have occurred to you, in Torment it's because your character is intuitive, and good things happen; Dragon Age gives the player every choice the narrator could think of, regardless of how stupid or useless it is, and curiosity is punished by having to reload. Torment lets you return to what was said before and ask a character everything you want to know; Dragon Age unpredictably locks you out of conversation paths, forcing you to reload.  The plot premise is that a horde of orc-like creatures is descending upon civilization and your job is to gather a force to resist them. Your character is a type of legendary warrior basically the same as in &#34;The Witcher&#34;, and the land is in turmoil, so almost everyone you meet is in need and asking for your help. The world's society is dominated in part by a powerful altruistic and mystical church which censors knowledge and punishes dissenters.  I first abandoned the game in a town where I was given dialogue options between attempting to persuade someone and pulling rank. I tried persuade, which failed, and then the option to pull rank vanished as well. Why? I still have my rank. This was obviously a contrivance intended to punish failures to persuade, but how could the narrator not care that it is completely irrational? My last save was 40 minutes ago, I was just talking to people since, who wants to mechanically repeat that? I guess I need to save before each conversation in case the narrator chooses to do this again.  Another example: This is the journal entry for a particular quest: &#34;You led lord Dace to believe that you would speak for his cause, but instead you humiliated him in front of all the nobles.&#34;  However, this is what really happened: Dace: You return. Were my instructions unclear? Me: I've spoken to Lady Helmi. Dace: And what did she have to say? Me: She said my house would suffer from your plan. Dace: I see. Some preposterous story, I'm sure. Me: Your plan would have forced my house to pay surface debts. Dace: I suppose it could. I mean, well, it's the spirit of the law that's important, right? Our poor disenfranchised surface brothers. Dace: Bah! Well played, your Highness. Welcome to Assembly politics. Dace: Now if you're excuse me. Me: Not so fast. Dace: You've won. Don't be stupid about it. Gorim (companion): Don't forget who you're speaking to. This is the guest of honor and child of the first house of Orzammar. Dace: For now. We shall see what the future holds. Trian's grasp on the throne is in no way certain and much can happen before then. Now, let me be. Me: Your schemes are an insult to House Aeducan. Gorim: Lords, ladies! Our Lord Aeducan has challenged the honor of Lord Dace  How does this get summarized as &#34;You led lord Dace to believe that you would speak for his cause, but instead you humiliated him in front of all the nobles.&#34; How do I end up being the deceiver? I deliberately acted with integrity. I can't trust this narrator.
156	1	I had no issues linking these with Steam. Installed easily and is a blast to play! I would recommend this to anyone.
157	-1	"I have ME1 and ME2. I was really looking forward to this game, but I can't purchase it because I refuse to support EA in any way.<br /><br />I'll just make a quick list as to why.<br /><br />- Steam fiasco: EA seems to only care about maximum per unit revenue.<br />- EA Origin client: Border-line-spyware/DRM that masquerades as a game manager.<br />- Day 1 DLC that isn't really DLC: It wasn't a side story, like \\""Smuggler bay\\"" or \\""The rogue planet\\"". The day 1 DLC was directly related to the story. It was a unapologetically transparent test of a monetization scheme to get the release price of an AAA game to a soft $80.<br />- And lastly, the fact that all this is just how EA does business and supporting that only helps them become the publisher of more IPs.<br /><br />I'm just adding it to the growing list of games I really wanted to play, but didn't because they were published by EA.<br /><br />At this point, I wont buy an EA game on principle alone. Your money is more powerful than your words, use it wisely.<br /><br />This is a review in the same sense that someone can make a recommendation on a blender based on their knowledge of the company that makes it. Coincidentally, I recommend Vitamix. They last forever and stuff circulates really well."
158	0	Keep in mind THESE are Microsoft points. Not Xbox credit I bought this for getting a gold membership but I couldn't. I could buy games/dlc from the dashboard but no gold membership.
159	0	I loved the game, a lot, played every day. Until I realized it was just another nickel and dime DLC style game.<br />Just not a fan of that style of game development that every modern game designer takes now days..<br />It was great bang for the buck when you could get it for ~15$ and play/experience the whole game.<br />Now you have to spend $15+$2+$3+5+2.5+.75+1.25+2....you get the idea....
160	1	good
161	1	very fun games<br />can spend countless hours on it<br />i like this game vintage look better than the new cartoony and childish look of RCT3
162	0	For the price I paid, this collection was a good deal. Homefront and Metro 2033 are worth the price alone if you don't have them. They do require Steam for activation.
163	-1	could not get it to download waste of money.
164	1	Very good buy if you love the gears of war franchise. Gears of war 3 is one of the best in my opinion of the whole franchise. Purchase was instant. Received an email in a couple of minutes with my code. It's that fast and simple!
165	-1	If I can't play a SINGLE PLAYER game because of server issues then something is seriously wrong. I'll edit this review to probably a 3 star once they get all of this sorted, but this game is forever partially tarnished in my eyes. Do not support EA.
166	0	Played on a GTX 750 TI.<br /><br />I never played the original for the PlayStation 3, so I didn't get what all the fuss was about when it came to Steam. I acknowledge that it's good, but I guess I took in too much hype and ended up a bit neutral on the whole thing. It's a beautiful game, and it looks very good running at 1080p. Know that you're getting into a pretty tough turn-based strategy game before you buy because it was kind of frustrating at points - and that's coming from a guy who can breeze through play-throughs of XCOM: Enemy Within for fun.<br /><br />I would recommend it if you like anime or hardcore strategy games, especially if you can pick it up for $10 or less.
167	-1	Stinks, tons of freezes and little support. No really new modes to play, seems like just a re-polished version of BF3 with more glitches. :(
168	0	I am not sorry I purchased this.  Maybe some day I will get it figured out.  I had in the past had a submarine game for a Tandy 1000.  It wasn't as complicated and was fun.  The 2 sub games are are really built to be a simulator.  Fleet command did download, but does not work quit right on my Dell. with Windows 7.
169	0	not bad , not great<br />I LOVED the 1st DiRT<br />can't seem to find the patchs to get the 1st one to work anymore so thought i would try this one<br />don't hate it , don't love it<br />good for one play through
170	1	Code worked so no complaints here.
171	-1	Shame on you, EA, for copping out. Quit being a cheapskate and put more &#34;moniez&#34; into your Sims games to improve the look. We all know with those stupid expansions you force everyone to buy, you can afford it.<br /> Why can I make a sim in the Sims 2 that looks just as if not more realistic than a sim in the Sims 4? Riddle me that, batman...er-uh EA.
172	-1	The download doesnt even work don't waste your money on this stupid thing! 30 dollars gone to waste and I am extremely furious!!!
173	-1	At least it was cheap. I lost interest in the game very quickly. wouldnt reccomend it even at the price.
174	0	I bought this for my ps4, it was cheaper to buy the code and upgrade, and it looks amazing. I haven't played it on the ps3 though. The story was good except for a few parts and had lots of fun pirating ships.
175	1	This pack, when on sale, typically goes for around $7.50 - assuming you have a retro vibe going, which is why you're looking at reviews for Genesis games, this is a steal at that price and includes Mega Drive Game Packs 1-5 in Steam-redeemable keys. The only downside? You have to redeem the keys on steam. HOWEVER, you can run the emulator (program that makes the games work on modern computers) outside of steam.<br /><br />For a retro gamer such as myself, this was easily worth the $7.50 just for pack 5, which includes Phantasy Star 2-4.
176	1	This is an amazing deal from Amazon! Crusader Kings 2 is normally 40 dollars by itself. Throw in the popular Magicka and the Sword of the Stars games, plus Victoria II, AND promo offers for downloads of Europa Universalis III Chronicles and Hearts of Iron III and you have more strategy goodness than you'll know what to do with.
177	0	Just okay. Online experience not to fluid always keep getting disconnected. I wish it would be more easier to set up the PS4. It could be a pain if you do not know how to configure your router to open your ports for better experience.
178	1	Package was secure and stable, no issues found in the shipping or delivery.
179	1	Thanks
180	0	The rating I gave this is a little inaccurate; I have played the demo version and it's intriguing, but the download I purchased failed to function on my computer although I am not sure why; either something is missing or something got scrambled or whatever happens with downloads, so I have not been able to actually play the game; not sure if once purchased someone can download it a second time, but haven't tried that yet.
181	-1	LOVED Men Of War and Assault Squad but..... didn't like this one.  My problem with this expanision is their is virtually no variety with this game's missions. Nearly every single mission in this game just consisted of you having a small squad that had to sneak around an army in an area, sabotage or capture a few objectives and then usually hold off a HUGE counter attack or eliminate the entire army in the area with your small squad.  In the other Men Of War games(more so Men of War then Assault Squad) you had WAY more variety then this with missions, in those games, you had some missions that were like these ones then in others missions you would have some missions that were all out huge battles against two armies with hundreds of troops, and some other missions were a little in between those two....that didn't happen in this game...just pretty much every single time what I described up above.  Made it all blah afterawhile to me...
182	1	Downloaded quickly and easily and game is awesome!  Best ten bucks I ever spent.  I would recommend this game to anyone that likes nonstop action games.
183	-1	Probably the most embarrassing EA/Maxis game ever. So horrible. Tiny cities, weird social functions, and huge errors with their servers that shouldn't even be required. BUT worst of all is ORIGIN. I don't want your disgusting bloaty software running on my computer at any time ever. Sorry, you guys just suck.
184	1	having a lot of fun
185	-1	no worth the download
186	1	Wonderful game!!  Great Buy for entertainment.
187	0	ive successfully downloaded the game. how do i get to an install screen? theres nothing on the purchase page to help with this?>
188	0	just what you'd expect from a very linear FPS. It is engrossing, yet nothing new. i recommend it if you like spending 40 bucks on games that last 12 hours and have no replay value.
189	-1	After I bought I couldn't download it without signing up for Origins and then I had to pay another $1.99 to get it.  My daughter really likes this game and since she is handicapped it keeps her busy
190	0	I love to play Slingo.  It is a very addictive game but does not require alot of thought.  The only thing I don't like about this version is that there is no angel to save you when you spin the devil. I thought this was odd and don't like the missing feature.
191	1	Easy and simple
192	1	good but not very long for the price.
193	-1	this is BS. ive bout a bunch of these before and never had a problem. My request has been pending for 3 hours and not a damn thing. wtf is this....?
194	1	nice
195	0	I bought this hoping that I could use it as a console away from home thing.  No option to switch over to xbox contoller interface, which kinda stinks.  ME 2 & 3 work great on Windows 8 Pro, can't get ME 1 to even open.
196	1	bought this around christmas time can not get a better deal at any other store, i like online shopping because i can use it right there and then, no driving to the store.... easy to install. good product
197	0	Evil Under The Sun is better. I like the idea of moving the people, but for a Search and Find it was o.k.
198	-1	The developers have done an extremely sloppy job at this game. Don't buy it unless you want a pc game that is full of bugs all over the place. The game doesn't ever run properly. The developers have published a number of updates but the game is still full of bugs.
199	0	The game has problems with Windows 8.  Your experts know of these.  However, last communication on 16 Aug indicated they<br />need more time to work on the issues.  Since that date I have not heard from any Amazon employee.  I hope that will change.
200	0	Love Fishdom 3 but the other two games are rather repetitive.  This is probably my own fault, as I should have been a bit more careful in reading what was included.  But I do enjoy playing these games while waiting for something to download or while eating my lunch.  Just probably did not need the whole bundle.  The graphics and music are quite nice though, and the games are engaging.
201	-1	Gameplay itself is incredible, but the lack of features is disturbing. The menus are extremely clunky and non-intuitive, but the worst thing of all is there is no way to directly invite or challenge friends to play with each other online, which is what we (my friends and I) bought it for.
202	-1	"This game is just terrible. Black flag is not going to be better. The single player is completely disappointing. Remember all those cool hype trailers that got you excited for the game? The stuff that looked like gameplay? Nope, sorry. Not in the game. I don't want to get started on the multiplayer, but since this is a review, I will. Describe it in one word? Ok, \\""broken.\\"" This is interchangeable with awful, aggravating, s***ty, or rigged. It barely worked ever, and it's no wonder that they lost their player base within months. I hope that someone sees this before they make the mistake that I did. It is quite unfortunate that the Assassins Creed development team is so inferior to the teams working on FarCry and Splinter Cell. I only wish that I had made this review sooner, and I apologize to all who purchased this game."
203	1	I like this game. The graphics and sound are really super and the game...intense! It was easy peazy to download from Amazon and I had it the day it was released. Honestly they don't even barely sell computer games at retail stores today. This is simply the best way to buy new games in my opinion.
204	0	Good game overall, campaign sucks
205	1	Everything went absolutly well. Thanks a lot!
206	-1	My computer runs windows 8.1, and the installed game will not run because there is an incompatability issue. I wish there had been a line before I bought it that stated that there are issues with running it on operating systems past windows 8.
207	-1	Not at all what I was hoping for.<br /><br />Limited, very limited.  Depending on the price, it might be worth trying, but you won't get more than a few hours of enjoyment out of it.
208	-1	I played this game years ago and I had a lot of fun with it.  I love puzzle games, and this was the first I played where the characters spoke vocally to each other.  Most of the game so far the background sound is much louder than the voice sound.  The in game sound settings do not work correctly.  I turned them all down and the background sound is still playing loud, but the voice sound is gone.  The graphics were nice too, but I wouldn't expect them to be good compared to today's standards.  I do expect that the sounds would work correctly, especially the voices.  This was a great idea, but unfortunately a bust.  I am running Windows 7 and was surprised when I saw this digital download that allows the game to run in Windows 7.  Except that it's built with DOSBOX and works about as well as any DOS game using DOSBOX.  I actually still have the CD for the game and could have just used that and DOSBOX without having to spend money.  I feel like I was taken advantage of and I am very disappointed with it.
209	-1	Pain to download and install. Don't buy it because of steam.  Steam is a pain. There you go. Thank you.
210	0	I SPENT HOURS ONLINE WITH ORIGIN TECH SUPPORT TRYING TO GET IT TO DOWNLOAD ORIGIN TO WORK ON 8. HAD TO PUT IT ON A LAPTOP WITH 7. THEN WHEN I GOT IT TO WORK ON DESKTOP WITH 8 IT IS IN 2D. NEXT TIME I WILL TRY TO FIND THE DVD. THE GAME ITSELF IS VERY GOOD ON THE LAPTOP WITH 7.
211	1	BL is my #1 most played game, sorry COD, and I have 3\4 DLC's so here is MHO about this one. General Knoxx is the best DLC out of the bunch to me by far.<br />First off, you get more scooter which is always good, he has a line early on that still cracks me up. This one also has the most missions and takes the longest to beat completely. You also get a new vehicle that can seat up to 4 persons in coop which is nice.<br />I also liked that the missions are REALLY tough if you go straight from finishing the game to this one. I would highly recommend you save this DLC for last unless you like a real challange.<br />The bonus here is the weapons, which have been the most powerful I have found. I just got the new DLC, claptrap revenge and all the guns have a level limit of 48. I have guns I got in knoxx that are lvl 54 and higher so if you get knoxx first you will have to wait if your under level. I would buy claptrap revenge then knoxx as its no fun passing on tons of guns b\c they dont come close to what you already have.
212	0	My experience is that the convenience of getting an online game code for Microsoft Points is counteracted by paying New York sales tax.  Which is interesting because getting a Microsoft Points card carries no sales tax with it.  If like me you are looking for a quick Rock Band fix, only have 700 Points and need 800 for the 4 songs you want, it is convenient not having to wait 2 days for the card to come in, or drive to a store and not get triple points on your Amazon Visa.  But if you aren't impatient, wait and get a card in the mail.    5 Stars for convenience  0 Stars for tax
213	1	fast. good. no problem.
214	-1	After multiple attempts to load and play the game it has consistently failed to run.  It hangs then STEAM constantly reports that the game is running.  Multiple eMail's to the maker and distributor have gone unanswered.  This product should be avoided at all costs as should this distributor.
215	0	Well I am glad I only paid $3-4 for this game. It was by far the easiest of any HOG's I've played. And it had some run-time issues on my computer that got very annoying causing me to exit and have to replay one room three times.    On the other hand, it did have many levels, the graphics aren't bad and it took me several hours to finish it - I feel like I got my money's worth. The mini-games were far too easy but the story line was somewhat compelling and finished up nicely. In each room, one has to solve multiple problems and there was always one mini-game per room.    If you're looking for some light entertainment that is not terribly taxing and not terribly expensive, you'll enjoy this game. Just make sure you turn your virus checker to run after you play or you might run into some conflicts.
216	1	I absolutely adore the game and suggest it to many gamers out there. It is beautiful and very well made.
217	0	"Even with mediocre reviews I thought I'd give this game a shot.  I don't feel cheated, but I doubt the game will hold my interest for longer than a week.  As pretty much everyone stated, it's not like the normal Sims games, and that was a plus for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The different archetypes were fun to create and experiment with.  Monarch, Wizard, Bard, Physician, Priest, Monk, etc.  The diversity of play in this regard was a major attracting point for me.<br />- Class-based actions were fun - discovering and gathering is fun.  The physician was fun - the way he applied first aid was to throw leeches in Sim's faces.<br />- There is a good amount of humor woven in.<br />- Decorating the buildings is a lot of fun and if you choose to go unfurnished to start, you begin with a decent amount of money to play with.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The quest system is annoying.  You can't simply play the game.  You must choose a quest from a limited selection (they change as you go through the game) with one or more Sims as the questor(s).<br />- The focus system (like mood) can be hard to manage when there is more than one Sim involved in a quest.  I felt like I was trying to keep my focus up and didn't have time to do things like maintain relationships, explore, gather... you pretty much have to take care of responsibilities (like daily quests) and the main quests to keep your Sim happy.<br />- Certain gameplay style is built in.  For example, the two religions are not the same - one is boring and funny and the other is rich and fear-based.  To do well as a Jacobian priest, you instill fear into your church members to get more donations and \\""win\\"" favor.  Stereotypical and inflexible.<br />- I hated some of the responsibilities - I did not like playing the Merchant AT ALL, for example, because you have to \\""butter up\\"" your customers and convince them to buy stuff.<br /><br />Overall, I think the cons outweigh the pros, and I wish there was more opportunity for freedom."
218	-1	Yes this ins't much of a game, but for $1.99 I really can't get mad.  Broken up area levels, just seemed like a 5 year old laid out the levels.
219	1	Buy this for the Play Station Plus Online. If you choose download, you get the code and you put it in online and your done. I like this option so Sony does not have my credit card online.
220	0	grandson loved it.  Not much more to say about this.<br />one two three four five six seven eight nine ten.......there is this enough to fill your word requirement?
221	-1	"Off the bat, I took away 2 stars for being forced to use Uplay. It doesn't add any value. I'm forced to create another user account for another service that I don't want.<br /><br />The game is pretty. There is great potential there. The environments and the character models are quite polished. My PC allows me to run the game on the \\""Ultra\\"" setting without hearing the fans kick in. It's great to be able to see a game how the developers meant for it to be seen. Unfortunately, the game is full of glitches that make the game unplayable. Whenever I kill an enemy, the body flies around the environment, shattering windows, alerting other enemies , etc. Tech support, if it were only a graphics glitch then it should not affect the environment or the AIs in it. It completely prevents me from being stealthy so I get gunned down quickly, or have a random dog fly through a wall and chew my arm until I die. Why are the dogs so deadly in this game?<br /><br />Also, why do I have to pay to upgrade my gear? It doesn't make any sense. The government wants me to track down and stop the terrorists. Why would the government not give me the tools to perform that duty for free? Do you want equipment that's going to keep you alive? Well, you have to buy it. You buy them with in-game currency that you receive for completing missions, which doesn't make sense either. I'm guessing Ubisoft intended to sell in-game items and upgrades for real money, but I didn't explore the upgrade system deep enough to see if it was a \\""pay to win\\"" model.<br /><br />If I hadn't received this game free with my GTX 760, I would ask for a refund. It's not worth the aggravation."
222	-1	this program does not download from this site.
223	1	The problem with the Sims 3 is that you get lost in it. It's really addicting and great. The expansion packs add some allure to it but I can only play it once every couple of months because I get a bit over saturated and it's TIME consuming. But, it's a great thing to play when you just need a break from life.
224	0	The updates for the port have fixed a good amount of the horrible issues, but the collection as a whole remains mediocre.<br />Maybe worth it for cheap, but expect issue when you want the three locked fighters in UMK3.<br />The game is also locked at 1280x720. The rest of my issues are nitpicky but I still expected better quality.
225	-1	the game would not download into the computer just kept saying fatal error! I will never buy another download cause when they don't work you are S.O.L !!!!!
226	1	This has been on my computer since I got it years ago! My go to game when I get tired of looking for something new!
227	-1	I've been staring at this screen for days. It says I have no skills in training, but I keep waiting for skill points to pop up so I can add them, but I'm not getting any?<br /><br />Update: I just saw a bright flash of light, and then I transformed into an egg. Did I level up?
228	1	pretty good game, i didnt expect it to be good. i found it weird how the character got out of the car but the racing and action going on as you race is pretty bad a$$.
229	-1	The port from console to PC was done VERY badly.  The game is slow, choppy and none of the fixes work.  Don't waste your money.  If I could give this a negative number I would.  A game is no good if you can't play it!
230	1	This product was exactly what I thought it was going to be. No problems with redeeming the code at all.
231	1	This a a very entertaining addition to TS3. While the dragons are not pets like you might think, it is fun to interact with them.
232	0	a fun game.
233	1	I got this when it was $20 on sale; even at regular price this is still worth the price.<br /><br />Xcom: Enemy Unknown is a great update to the original(even though I'm still partial to the originals myself).<br /><br />Civ IV is a great entry in the Civ series, a definite &#34;Do Not Miss&#34;, while Civ V has better graphics and a much more streamlined and user friendly interface; aswell as Steamworks support for TONS of replay value.
234	0	"I don't want to give too low a rating because this might be just the kind of puzzling game you like. I was still in my 30-minute trial and got tired of \\""you can't do that yet\\"" notices whenever I clicked on any active element of the screen. There might be a dozen things you can't do yet....but I couldn't find *anything* I could do. I play a lot of these games, though I must add that I play them for entertainment and not for frustration. Based on entertainment value, this is not intuitive; gameplay is not fluid with some degree of challenge, it seems to be a series of dead-ends. I lasted about 20 minutes, which may seem to be less than the developers would have preferred I spend on learning the game, but I stopped having fun after about 10 minutes. I also must add that I did not make constant use of the hint system...but if I have to have a hint for every move, why bother playing? I'm not saying not to try this--you might like it. It just didn't flow for me."
235	-1	I love time management & farming games but this one is so boring. I downloaded the demo & didn't even finish the 30 minute trial. I'm deleting it.
236	0	unfortunately this game requires steam and NOT what i wanted.. the fact that it or any game requires that steam be installed on your computer SHOULD NOT BE IN FINE PRINT at the bottom of the page as it was but  SHOULD BE at the top in bold red print and a much larger font so people know this.. thankfully amazon granted my request for a refund after checking my account and see that i only buy games that can be downloaded as a stand alone product..
237	1	good game, challenging and fun to play. this game will be one to keep,check it out and it will be an experience for game playing.
238	-1	For some reason, EA has decided that what its customers need is a broken product that penalizes people who buy the game.
239	1	I like sonic but recent sonic games disappointed me. They had slow speed, weird stage level...<br /><br />But It is great sonic game.<br /><br />You can meet cool and awsome sonic.
240	1	This is a fun game for sure, and the HD quality on the PS4 is very nice. I am enjoying it lots.
241	0	I found it wasn't intuitive i had to keep getting hints and the story was choppy
242	-1	Actually, this download turned out to be useless, it never worked properly, my grandson was so disappointed<br />and so was I! I have ordered different items from Amazon, all from private sellers, with no problems at all.<br />This download, directly from Amazon was a DUD!!!
243	0	I played this game back in the Playstation days and I thought I would buy the PC version since I missed playing this game. After leaving the game first time my mouse stopped working. I couldn't move it anywhere, and despite disconnecting the mouse & reconnecting it did not work and it forced me to restart my computer. I checked for solutions and I wasn't alone. It's not fully compatible on the Windows 7 OS. I had to run it in compatibility mode for XP for the game to work better, but mouse problems still came up occasionally. I am also having an issue with the game freezing for a split second then resuming, only to reoccur 10 seconds later. This game is playable but you'll need to be patient with the graphic issues and freezes. Some missions even make the game crash also. I still have a lot of fun putting in cheats and doing amusing stuff!
244	1	really a good game, excellet grafics and sound.
245	0	Good for an older game.  However, my problem was that it would not run until I uninstalled NVIDIA PhysX and allowed it to install an older version of that software.  The newer version caused errors.
246	1	:)
247	-1	the game holded by antivirus and described as a trojan &#34;by bitdefender company&#34;, and even when disable the antivirus and firewall and reinstall the game it gives a black screen with &#34;false instruction&#34; !!  any body face such or think i'm wrong i asked him to clarify ....
248	0	It was way better than the second game, but Bioware didn't quite manage to bring home the same feel the ending of the first game gave. I didn't feel a sense of fulfillment from the ending like I did from the first game. I spent a very long time just thinking about the ending and came up with a large list of ideas and determined my own thoughts based on them. Sometimes the best endings of shows and books are those left up to the interpretation of the readers, but games don't tend to work the same way. Most of my friends just wanted an epic boss battle to finish the fight.
249	0	the game is fun for a few missions,but after that it just gets repetitive.The graphics are ok. But lacks in the amount of resources.for me it was just an average game. if they would of added more buildings and different game play, i would of given it more stars.
250	1	Digital code makes life easy. Needed a gift for a friends son and didn't have time to run out anywhere. Got the code and had the birthday boy load it.
251	1	If you don't have xbox live gold you cannot play multiple players, watch movies or redeem amazon free movies for your home entertainment, for us anyway.
252	-1	Lots of fun when it works.  It keeps crashing on my Vista laptop. Frustrating.
253	-1	I am a elite online gamer, I am the best at Call of duty. So I was on the look out for another online game to show my skillz. Guild wars 2 claims to have the best combat in a online game so I bought it. But when I went to equip my sniper rifle to quick scope I find out it's not even available in this game, what kind of a joke is this?. Instead of killing terrorists, I have to kill 10 bears with a bunch of pansies shooting harry potter style magic out their fingers?<br /><br />Save your money and buy Black Ops 2 in a few months, only people who lack quick scoping skillz play this game.
254	0	"When I see something categorized as a \\""puzzle\\"" game, I assume that I'll need to use my brain more than eye-hand coordination (of which I have none).  But the controls on this game are really difficult to get the hang of.  For a couple of bucks, I guess it's worth a shot, but I quit after just a few minutes.  Not my style."
255	1	I bought this for my son's birthday as I remembered it fondly when I was a kid going to the arcade.  It did not disappoint. The only complaint I had was in the non intuitive setup of the controller and trying to figure out the key mapping. Really a minor complaint.  Works in multiple OS configurations and systems.
256	-1	i have adjusted multiple settings including fit it to windows, changed windows 7 compatibility, removed norton virus protect (apparently because it interferes with steam), messed with every conceivable resolution setting and yet this game reliably crashes upon starting the game.  i'm not a teenager with hours of time to spare, i'm not a computer programmer, but i am reasonably capable of working through windows 7 settings, yet this game simply does not work.  if you don't believe me, just go to the firaxis forum on this game and you will see a disclaimer talking about how they're aware of the bugs and crashes and to have faith that they're working on them.  whatever. don't buy it. it doesn't work.
257	0	This game is a pretty good game kinda like a space version of the sim 1.<br />Its easy to download and Amazon makes it real easy to download again if you lose your file or delete it .
258	1	"The Good: Excellent story with strong moral choices, wonderfully crafted characters, beautiful graphics with DX11 support, combat is fast paced, lots of abilities to unlock, tons of loot, great boss fights<br /><br />The Bad: Very linear and repetitive environments, sterile looking compared to Origins, constant loading between areas<br /><br />Dragon Age: Origins was Bioware's gift to gamers missing the old action RPGs of yonder such as Diablo, Baldur's Gate, and Icewind Dale. Dragon Age II has come along and is really a love it or it hate it type of thing. It's almost nothing like Origins, but there's a lot of good in this as well, but the game does have more flaws than the original, but I will get to those later.<br /><br />DA2 tells the story of Hawke who is the Champion of Kirkwall in events that take place right after the last game. DA2 really concentrates on a more personal level with the companions and Hawke instead of an overall save-the-world type story. The Darkspawn play a very small role in this story and you only encounter them a few times. Don't mistake DA2 for a poor linear story because the moral outcomes become the usual Bioware head scratchers, and as the game goes on your choices make bigger and bigger impacts. The story is broken up into three acts which respectively has you rising to power, using that power, then finally completely unleashing your abilities as Champion of Kirkwall to either save the mages or help the Templars destroy them. The character in DA2 are absolutely amazing in both looks and personality plus some cameos and appearances from the last game. You really get attached to each one and want to use them all during battle.<br /><br />The story is probably the best thing going for DA2, but it does have a bit of a slow start. If you are used to Origins huge overarching story you might actually get bored for a while with this one. Little things help influence the story like romances (yes gay romances work here), but there are so many choices during dialog that the story could turn so many different ways, so you always feel like you have complete control. The dialog is more like Mass Effect with a wheel that has several options. You can choose from the usual good/bad dialog, but a new sarcastic one has been added in the middle and I always chose these because they were just clever. Just like any Bioware game relationships with characters can also impact dialog and will give you advantages or disadvantages depending on that.<br /><br />So, if you go into DA2 expecting an excellent story you won't be upset there. What you will probably hate is the more action oriented combat and more linear and repetitive environments. The combat has fast fluid animations instead of the clumsy combat from Origins. Characters strike hard and fast and there are lots of gore which I didn't mind. Of course you can have up to ten quick slots equipped for abilities and the new tree is very intuitive. There are different ability classes and then each ability can also be upgraded inside that. Loot collecting and leveling up works just like Origins including junk, but you can't equip armor on companions. Yeah, its one of those \\""What the hell?\\"" type issues with the game. Sure you can add runes to their armor and weapons, but just don't expect to change their armor.<br /><br />There are a lot of changes from Origins that really shouldn't have been touched including the linear and extremely repetitive environments. You move around a map and just follow the arrow on your map to each goal. Since you are just in Kirkwall you are moving around the same hallway dungeons, and the same main map cities. After act 1 you have probably seen 75% of the game. I really missed the open areas from Origins and the feeling of being in an open world. Sure the graphics got a huge upgrade and it all looks nice, but there isn't much variety. This disappointed me more than anything else in the game were the repetitive areas that kept you strictlyin Kirkwall. There are some outdoor environments, but don't expect a lot of them. There is also constant loading between areas and this drove me nuts early on.<br /><br />Of course there's a lot of good loot, resource collecting, and you can use poisons and grenades like before, but what I hate still are the potion cool down times that are set at 30 seconds. This can make hard boss fights very frustrating because later on you'll have a ton of money and have over 100 potions but you can only use one every 30 seconds, and this goes for stamina droughts as well. The only thing I  like about the new combat system is the faster pace and speed. There are so many abilities that you won't even unlock them all in one play through.<br /><br />Overall DA2 feel like a Dragon Age game, but that nostalgic feeling from Origins is gone and I really missed that. DA2 will keep you busy for a good 30+ hours and there even some great side quests. The visuals are great with DirectX 11 support and high-resolution textures on the PC, so if you have the rig this is the way to go. However, the graphics seem more sterile than Origins due to linearity so it loses its charm in that area a bit. I highly recommend DA2 to fans of the past game, but don't expect this to be a true to heart sequel.in Kirkwall. There are some outdoor environments, but don't expect a lot of them.

259	-1	The servers constantly go down, I lose data on my city all the time because your city is saved on their servers and not your computer. I have always been a sim city addict but I wish I had never bought this piece of crap. On top of that all of the city lands are freaking small! This game sucks balls!
260	-1	Don't waste your money on this.  The colors of the balls are sometimes hard to distinguish.  When you fail a level the re-run of that level, how many times you need it, has the exact same balls in the exact same order.  But the worst things is the poor precision.  When there's an overpass/underpass situation, the balls have to be an inch from the underpass before an incoming ball will connect, otherwise it just flies over!  The edge of the underpasses destroy incoming balls, instead of letting them fly over.  Save your money, buy Luxor or Inca Ball instead.  They have quality.
261	0	Cute little game.  Not much of a challenge.  Loved the Christmas music while I played.
262	1	Got it instantly and worked fine.  Got three more of these and they all worked fine. Recommend this for quick psn cards while at home
263	1	This game looks great as far as graphics and the story is very well written. There's a lot of choices to make to a point that sometimes it seems overwhelming, but at the end of the day there's a path that you are suppose to follow, but it makes you feel like there's a million options, not really, maybe you'll change the reaction of a few characters, but overall we will all get the same story minus a few tweeks.<br />There's people you want to save that there's no way to save no matter what you do. That is kind of annoying.<br /><br />The controllers when it comes to close up actions are very shitty; sometimes you need to do the same scene a bunch of times not because it was difficult, but because the controllers SUCK. Don't get me wrong, the game is good, but it needs some modifications.
264	1	Yes, it did and thank you very much.  I really enjoy all of Nancy Drew games.  They are awesome.
265	0	Only disappointment was that you can not turn of the sounds so no way to listen to music while playing.
266	1	I enjoyed most land related aspects of the game such as resource acquisition, economic and military structure. My main disapointment seemed to be in the AI naval military weakness. Liked the card deck application as the best improvement to game vs earlier versions.
267	1	Excellent code, great to download PS games, bad thing is your account has to be activate to play the games, that's the only defect PlayStation has.
268	1	Great game if your into politics or religion or war or whatever side you want to claim. Those usually run together anyways huh......
269	1	PixelJunk Monsters has me addicted.  It's a Tower Defense style game.  I found out about Tower Defense games from playing 3d Dot Heroes, which has a Tower Defense mini game.  I wanted more Tower Defense, so I searched and found PixelJunk Monsters.<br /><br />Since I installed this game, I have stopped playing 3d Dot Heroes and all my other PS3 games and play this one exclusively.<br /><br />For those not familiar with Tower Defense style games, the goal is to stop monsters from killing off your villagers.  The goal is to set up various towers to defeat waves of advancing enemies.  There are several towers to choose from, including a fire tower, laser tower, and cannon tower.  Each tower has its plusses and minuses.  Certain towers work better on certain enemies.  Part of the fun for me was figuring out which combination of towers works the best.<br /><br />The monsters include spiders, a sasquatch-esque creature, and bats.  As the levels become more difficult, the enemies become more plentiful and stronger.<br /><br />If you manage to save all the villagers (I estimate about 20), you get a rainbow.  After getting a certain number of rainbows, you can move on to the higher levels.  One plus, is that you don't need to earn rainbows on each level in order to advance, so if you don't earn a rainbow on a particularly difficult lever, this doesn't stop you from advancing.<br /><br />I adore this game and can't wait to buy the expansion pack.
270	0	I was hoping it was a new game, but it's very old, but it works OK. Still looking for a better game.
271	-1	Havent been able to play multiplayer yet...Everytime I get in game it crashes within a minute sometimes I don't even get that far. I know my computer can play it, and i've tried everything possible to get it to work but the same thing always happens, get into game, black screen, crashes.<br />I have a 8 core fx-8320, 8gb ram, evga gtx 660, biostar ta970<br />I can play every game but this one..I just regret buying this unplayable game.
272	1	good
273	0	I choose this rating because its not as much boost as i wanted and the car is fine but it needs another car for it to be complete also it needs 8,000 instead of 6,000 boost
274	0	Bordelands 2 takes for granted your willingness to whore yourself to grind and advance yourself. Grinding makes final boss easy peezy. Lost interest before I got through with 1 character type. Still play, still get to kill things
275	-1	I have enough RAM and a fast enough Video card to handle the graphics of this game.   The game is slow and is constantly freezing up.  A total waste of $10.
276	-1	this game must have the worst drm ever! they guy who decided to release a product which such a drm scheme should be removed from working in the software industry instantly.<br /><br />i deeply regret buying this game and having thrown out my money. they did not even warn you before - you just install it three times on different hardware (and I have lots of different hardware) and then you can throw it away.<br /><br />of what use is a game when you cannot use it on any of your machines, when you cannot upgrade your machine anymore, or when you have to be online all the time during play???<br /><br />i will certainly never ever buy a ubi soft product again!
277	-1	GHOSTS really a big let-down.  What happened to the so-called awesome graphics?  I see polygons all over the place, look at the stupid dog's leg!<br /><br />First, let me say that I'm disappointed that yesterday this version (PS3 download) was available yesterday for $35 and today it's $49.89.  Thanks Amazon/Activision!  I tried to buy it last night and it wanted my credit card number, really???  How many times I buy stuff you don't ask for it and now you do???<br /><br />Also, I have the PS4 version and thought I'd comment on how GHOSTS is really a big let down.  They took away good tools that were fun to play because they listened to whiners.  Yeah, I can understand that they needed to cut down on idiots that would spawn in one spot so their buddies could kill them and rack up kill points, but many of us did not use tactical inserts for that purpose.  Claymores will be greatly missed, I'm sure someone thought what a great idea to put and IED in it's place, please fire that idiot.<br /><br />Grenade launchers... who thought it would be a good idea to put it on the trigger?  You screwed the pooch on this version, my last infinity ward version ever.  And I used to prefer Infinity Ward over Treyarch.  Not anymore!
278	-1	"had max payne 3 stashed in my going-to-get-to pc games stack. finally decided to install since, at some point in time, i'd played the other installments of the franchise. install went without a hitch. fired up the game only to be informed that, the game i'd already paid for, could not be played unless I joined rockstar game's \\""social club\\"". what b.s.! I installed and registered the game through steam, why the he11 should I need an additional account with some lame third-party just to play a paid-for game? s(rew you rockstar games! same to you \\""origin\\"" and \\""ubisoft\\""! i'll never buy any of your titles just to have you hold me hostage as to how I can play MY game!"
279	1	it's awesome how they made it like only purchase to get instant code instead of going to store and pick it up from a retail store
280	-1	I downloaded Avatar to my computer and it would not play. Maybe my computer does not have enough space,it's windows vista. I went to game stop and bought the game. The download was a waste of money for me. I just chalked it up to experience I will not download any other game.
281	-1	does not work. AT all. Has anyone found a solution to the problem? Ive read one review that has help with assets but I cannot find them in my computer system.
282	-1	So, I purchased this game on the 20th of July 2012 and since then MP has had near to 0 players and nearly all servers excluisivly play on Nuketown map, anyways for the SP, graphics are outated and are not good in any manner, this is my first COD after a string of playing battelfield (For me Battlefield was MUCH worse than this)<br />3/5 or 6/10<br />DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT MP 3/4 OF SERVERS ARE EMPTY
283	0	The game is great, got what I expected. Works well and my code worked. 3 stars because it was an average purchasing experience. The game itself is about 3 stars too. It's like FFXI meets WoW.
284	0	Pretty cool game, a lot of grinding and events though. Not enough quests to level you up alone. Still very fun and a pretty world.
285	-1	The game runs, and it is Terraria so it gets at least a few stars.<br />I will say though, for anyone that has played the PC version of this game, like myself, this port pales in comparison.<br />The controls are the main culprit here, as a game like this you really need a mouse for fine movement.<br />But considering you can mod the game, play custom maps, use a mouse, and have dedicated servers on the PC version for a third of the price, this review really only has one point. Get the PC version.
286	0	I have been playing  Tomb Raider since they first came out with the game.  In the beginning it was a very interesting game. You had to use your wits and strategize, However and time goes on every thing improved. The grafics became wonderful but the computer does most of the work. Now it takes all the fun out of the game.
287	1	Love the electronic delivery works everytime and keeps a record until I have time to input information.
288	1	This is probably one of the easiest ways to get this codes. And the better part is that you don't have to pay an extra, the exact price. Highly recommended.
289	0	The game itself is pretty good; however, there is so much limitation surrounding the game play. The major areas here are the limited size of the map and required online play (I very very often lose my city session because the server lost sync).<br /><br />Additionally, the game seems to have far less replay value than the other ones (probably due to size limitations)
290	1	I am a long time Sims player and was really happy to see the evolution of quests, as well as having a medieval theme.  Overall I have been very pleased with the game, as well as the Pirates and Nobles expansion.  My only complaint is having to repeat the same quests over and over for each ambition. Hopefully another expansion will be released with new quests.
291	0	I'm a huge Nancy Drew fan, but I can't say I'm a huge fan of this game. The majority of the time is just talking. Each character says different things to Nancy and her friends, so you have to switch between all the characters and talk to all the citizens and it just gets tedious sometimes. It is especially annoying that if I wanted to switch from Bess to George, for example, I must switch to Nancy first before switching to the other character.<br /><br />I did think there were some fun things about it, however, it isn't a very memorable game and I would much prefer to play a different ND game instead. I may play this game again in the future, but I can't say that I definitely will. It was just okay overall.
292	0	Fun game for the first few weeks. Not much content to see tho. Would have liked to see more weapons, a campaign etc.. the concept is cool I just think more stuff needs to be put in this game.
293	-1	"Does not work on my PC, despite the \\""fixes\\"" I found.<br /><br />Would have given it \\""0\\"" stars but you can't."
294	0	All the DLC content for Evolve game is overpriced, I would of been better off not buying this
295	1	Recomendado
296	-1	"Mass Effect 1 5/5, was one of the greatest Sci-Fi games ever made. It had intrigue, depth, metaphors, themes, and a story line that was never successfully attempted before. The action was pretty good but the RPG aspect was deep. You shaped the galaxy and you felt that your decisions could have possibly dire consequences, but you went through with what you thought was best. You explored the galaxy and the mako, a giant tank car thing, was your steed.<br /><br />Mass Effect 2 3.5/5, wasn't that bad. The story line was pretty good, and the themes are were decent. They took out a lot of the RPG elements, but improved the combat slightly. This in the end actually made the combat less personable, and exciting. The game is much more linear and the Mako Tank Car thing is gone. Still the game had some tough decisions, some of which weren't obviously the right path. Previous decisions made in Mass Effect 1, shaped the story and added a lot. This release wasn't the best but at least it was enjoyable and all of your hard work, and exploring paid off in the end.<br /><br />Mass Effect 3, is not a good game. Amazon's rating system works like this, 3 Stars means it's ok, 2 stars means I didn't like it and 1 star means I hate it. I actually wanted to give it 1.5 but, I couldn't. I didn't want to hate this game, but I did. There are few games that can leave such a bitter taste in my mouth, Diablo 3 comes to mind, but this nearly choked me with it. A game should only be rated on how much fun you have, and I did not have fun. This game is not Mass Effect. Nearly all RPG elements were removed, and again, like ME2, more focus was brought on to gunplay. This was obviously done to appeal to the COD4 masses(another terrible franchise), since their collective wallets outweigh the true fans. This is not entirely Bioware's fault, like some people would like you to believe, this is EA's. Multiplayer was added, which never was there before, again to maximize COD4 fans and to allow more ways to add DLC.<br /><br />Guns aside the story is OK, for the first part of the game. The start is pretty amazing, sadly after an hour it just fizzles out. You start to not to care for anyone else, since they lack character, and often transgressed on their development from the previous stories and do not develop at all. With most of the RPG elements removed you have a lack luster COD4 wannabe, 3rd person style. This game was stripped of uniqueness and difficulty to appeal, again, to the more casual gamer. You just don't care. There is one story, Legion's, which is the closest you are going to get in the style of Mass Effect 1, and is actually REALLY good. It's the best part of the game. You actually see the character grow, and you feel connected to him and what he does.<br /><br />The main goal of Mass Effect 3 is to amass a huge army to help protect earth. There is this meter, the more full the meter, the better chance earth has for survival. This is a hoax. This will only show a special ending with Shepard and the meter DOES NOTHING. The worst part is, you have to play multi-player to completely fill it. That's it. The game features multiple endings and you choose the ending much like you did a long time ago. No matter what you have done in the previous games, how much of a jerk you are, if you killed so and so, no matter WHAT YOU DID, it comes down to Choice A, B or C. Nothing matters. All the endings are the same. No real variations. No answers, no conclusions. Explosions and colors. All those years of carefully choosing who to save and what to do in the previous games was for naught. It's like studying to become a lawyer, working hard, networking and when it comes to the state bar they hand you a Popsicle and tell you that you will be a wonderful dishwasher. You get this \\""god\\"" child that was pulled out of thin air, a cliche, who basically says \\""I do this for this because of this because I am this for this it has always been this. The Matrix did it better. It will anger you. I am angry, and so are the people.<br /><br />I have two theories why they chose this ending.<br /><br />Theory 1. EA wanted the real ending to be a DLC that you would have to purchase. Yes that's right, buy the ending. What they didn't expect is rather than leave the game on a cliff hanger, or to entice the buyer for more, they enraged the fanbase. They realized they ruined a franchise and their chance of milking more DLC is gone. They quickly assembled an ending, much like the way Fallout has always handled them, and pushed it out rather than waiting for the real ending to be finished. Too late EA.<br /><br />Theory 2. EA wanted money to reach a certain goal promised to investors so they made Bioware finish the game far earlier than what was intended so they can profit and appease their investors. I am sure that Bioware didn't even want to add multiplayer, but EA forced them to. If multiplayer was never added, there was a chance that the game would have been more like Mass Effect 2 and that there would have been a more sensical ending. Instead we got this.<br /><br />-Pros<br />* Music is good<br />* Graphics look great, sometimes<br />* Legion's story was awesome<br />* Good voice actors.<br /><br />-Cons<br />* There's multiplayer<br />* Nothing you do matters<br />* Repetitive combat<br />* No real ending<br />* Not fun<br />* EA is the publisher of this game.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />If you want to have a fond memory of Mass Effect, just ignore this entry.er you.

297	0	This download is another game where you have to assemble menu items and serve to patrons. It's actually quite fun, and also has a sense of humor. The challenges grow bigger the longer you're playing, but it keeps your attention focused very well. I enjoyed this, and look forward to actually finishing it.
298	-1	It was glitchy and didn't run smoothly for me.  I also wasn't expecting the Steam third party approach.  I loved previous versions of the game, but I this was an exercise in frustration.  I regret the poor rating.
299	-1	Just both this game after it had been out for months. It did not install properly at first had to look online to fix the problem. I got this game for just $15 through a sale, would have like to pay even less.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- it's new<br />- more simply<br />- somewhat more interesting game play<br />- switching between cities take my computer 10-15 seconds (loading time)<br />- better placing of property<br />- transportation style is better, simpler, and space saving<br />- providing electricity and water is simpler<br /><br />Cons<br />- maps are soooo small, if you really wanted to you can fill in a city with 30mins to 1 hour<br />- the new game engine is retarded, to give you an example, it shows the amount of coal your plant has if you look at the plant and coal plant animations stop if you're out of coal, honestly this is what they decided the CPU should give power to, this is just dumb.<br />- also apparently they designed the engine to look at individual sims in more detail like their emotions and current activities, if I wanted to see sims in more detail I would've played The Sims<br />- their justification for not have bigger maps is because the game engine would stress out the CPU too much with bigger maps, well of course it will if you make it do pointless things like detailed sims and showing the proper amount of coal<br />- missing so many items compared to simcity 4 and to get them they will charge more money<br />- saves the game on their servers, most retarded thing ever<br />- origin is required and it is also dumb, EA needs to give steam/valve their games<br />- EA<br /><br />The only thing that I want improved is the map size that's it and this game would be so much better. Simplify the game engine by getting rid of pointless animations and details.
300	-1	game does not work EA better get there act together. they should have delayed the launch rather than piss everyone off with a game that doesn't function
301	-1	the game wasn't anything close to what was told we could expect, very disappointing, i wish i could get my money back
302	1	Seriously though, this game is awesome.  And for $7.50 I can't complain.<br /><br />It's basically Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe all over again with a slightly different character lineup, better graphics and slightly tweaked game mechanics.  You're not in for a revolutionary gaming experience that is going to blow your mind, but it's a great addition to the MK series.
303	1	This is my first game of the Battlefield series and I liked it a lot.  I didn't downloaded it through Amazon, I used origin to do it, just inserted the game serial in origin and it worked perfectly.  Awesome game.
304	-1	I was expecting something a little better. The graphics are hard to see and hard on the eyes I could only play for a half hour before I quit. The game was also unresponsive. I was glad that it was a free download.
305	0	What are you guys doing here's? you should be playing farmster hunter s'mores  instead go buy it nowwwwwww
306	-1	"This game is a typical hidden object game with clues and objects to interact throughout. Fun on the face of it.  But the only problem is you keep getting lost going back and forth.  You can go completely back to the first room and it never tells you to stop.  The \\""sparkles\\"" weren't there and I clicked on everything I could find.  Had to go to the online walkthrough to get relief quite a few times.  I don't count myself as stupid, but I became flumoxed with all the going back and forth with no directions.  Several of these games I have played keep you moving forward or tell you basically where you should be or close, but this one didn't.  Very frustrating."
307	0	Some of the puzzle games are hard to figure how to play.  At least you can skip them.  The third game in the bundle has some sort of a glitch that makes it difficult to place objects.  For instance, the fireplace items and the letters on the boat are AGGRAVATING to say the least.  You can try and try to place the items and they jump back to the original location.  The instructions are to place things in a row ... good grief.  I spent so much time trying to put the letters on the boat my game timed out and I had to replay the level.  It happened the second time and I gave up.  The graphics are good, though and I like that the complete list of objects being displayed.  Some HO games only show a few at a time.  On the whole, it is worth the money and will keep you occupied.
308	0	Compared to the other two, the story is lacking until about mid game.  Also, there are a few bugs I encountered that ultimately forced me to restart the game.<br /><br />On top of that, this is MUCH more challenging - mainly because the fighting is less responsive to the buttons than the other Arkham games.<br /><br />But, if you can get past that, you'll enjoy this game.  It's fun, and that's what matters most.
309	-1	I paid twice for the same product, only received one psn card.  I want my money back or another psn card!
310	-1	I am a fan of the games!  I love Tomb Raider.  However downloading took 2 days!  And after I started playing it, it crashed on the 3rd scenario.  Tried downloading it again, which took another two days (changed settings so that my laptop wouldn't sleep or hibernate or even darken the screen) and same results, even after starting a new game.<br />But it was definitely a great demo for the price!
311	-1	Do not purchase the online code option from Amazon! It will take it forever to process. I have currently been waiting over an hour and a half for the code and have filed numerous emails with Amazon concerning this matter and have gotten NO replies! It would be much easier to just pay the extra 10 bucks to xbox/microsoft and not have this problem. Thought I was getting a deal but this is a pain! Think I am just going to cancel this and pay the extra 10 bucks to xbox as soon as the 2 hour processing limit hits.
312	0	"This is a fun game to play mixing hidden object searches, mini puzzles, and the need to combine inventory items from several scenes to solve more complex puzzles.  I enjoyed playing the game, but as the other reviewer mentioned, some of the puzzles did not provide enough instruction.  Solving some of the puzzles was, therefore, a little more challenging that it needed to be.  You were also forced to backtrack around the castle so many times to collect all the inventory items needed to solve each puzzle that it became a little tedious searching for another area with \\""glittering lights\\"" indicating the need to find an object or solve a puzzle.  I also felt that this was not the most logical game I have played, so I had to resort to internet hints at least four times to figure out what to do next.  What I did like about the game was that the object searches were challenging -- no so much as to make it impossible, but I defy anyone to complete the hidden object portion of the game without resorting to the hint function at least once.  The biggest deal breaker for me is that the entire game took me less than two hours to play.  Believe me, by that time I was happy to see it end.  Therefore, I can't recommend highly.  I would, however, recommend Mystery Case Files, Dire Grove and Midnight Mysteries, the Salem Witch Trials."
313	0	I really like the idea. But 1st, I wanted a pale skin but this skin is really dark.  You can paint over it really carefully but why would I want to do that when I had to pay for it? 2nd, there are only 3 items that comes with the whole set.  Skin, dress, and chaos blades on the back.  Yes, this is enough to describe him, but most other costume pack comes with 4 or 5 items so you can use more out of it for your next customized costumes.  I'd recommend Assassin's creed costume over this for the same money, that one looks really good zoomed in and out.  This one doesn't really stand out from zoomed out screen.  Only thing that I'm not upset about the purchase is the fact that it is kratos, and it can be used on LBP2.  If not, I would regret the purchase of $2.
314	0	Playstation 3 is an outstanding videogame e its games also too, but Playstation Plus just offers the worst games ever or the games that is cheap or old. The &#34;new&#34; games offered have poor quality. The discounts is just present in a few number of games.<br /><br />Not guilt of Amazon... Just a note...<br /><br />Regards...
315	-1	One of the most disappointing games... in history.
316	1	You really can't go wrong with a bundle packaged like this.<br />There's not much to say besides that you're getting tons and tons of value and more gameplay hours with the GOTY edition and the season passes for BL2
317	-1	At the end of the day this is a 4 year old game being sold for 30 dollars.<br /><br />Sure, this is probably the lowest price we'll see for this game (or bioware points) for quite awhile, but we as customers should not encourage this sort of business practice if we want fair value in the future.<br /><br />With that said, the Mass Effect series is one that is well worth a playthrough, and if EA ever decides to put up the entire 3 game series + DLC up at one price--that is fair in relation to the normal videogame market--then I'd encourage anyone to pick them up.
318	1	for years this is how I distress and shake off the ravages of the day from husband to kids to work
319	-1	"It's a poor continuance of the sword of the stars games. It's glitchy at best and constantly crashes. It's also missing the missions/scenarios that the previous versions of the game included. In fact if you go to the scenario button, there are no scenarios listed at all. Then there is the ease of use that the previous versions had. No longer can you simply select a fleet and send it where you want it to go. Gone is the point and click on the technologies that you want and many of these \\""technologies\\"" don't even work. Nothing in the game is intuitive as in the previous sword of the stars series of games and there is often no way to use many functions or they just don't work at all. Even though the rendering of the ships may be a little more detailed, that is no reson to get this game that is broken from the start and has no game support at all. Don't buy this game"
320	0	I got this when it was on sale... it is a good buy when it is on sale, so I recommend waiting for the sale time if you like these kind of games :)
321	-1	So I tried to buy this, but Amazon.com don't allow digital downloads for customers outside the U.S.. I mean, how stupid is that? It's not like they're shipping it to my home address, plus there is NO OTHER WAY to buy this game, since the developer website only has Amazon as an option.    Reflexive have basically copped out of putting any effort into selling games, letting Amazon do all the work for them, and in the process effectively blacklisting any non-American customers.    Guess I'll have to take my business elsewhere, as they say.
322	-1	I did not purchase this.  Somebody hacked into my account!
323	1	Great
324	1	There's great games, and then there's the Demon's/Dark Souls games. Got this on sale, beat it a long time ago, but wanted to relive the experience. It says something when people still play it.
325	1	Love sims!!!
326	0	I had to get this because my 2008 version can't be applied to Windows 8.1.  These technical annoyances and inconveniences are a major dissatisfaction with this industry.<br />As for the content of the download:  it's got fewer games than the 2008 version.  My biggest disappointment being that it doesn't have the game Tarot.  That was a favorite.<br />As for play, it still has a steep computer bias against natural hands and the human player.
327	0	Needs more wepon types maybe a rocket launcher.
328	0	Help topics.<br />There is not enough explanation of how to use the product  to realize its full enjoyment, I cannot find anything in the software to explain how to use the product to full advantage.
329	-1	I just recently purchase this game 5/30/13 and for the first 5 minutes or so it was fun but it's pretty much the same thing over and over and over again.<br />First map and only map I've played was the zombie map. First of no one was online, the only way to really play multilayer is to go to the forum and find people who wants to play.<br /><br />The game play itself was below average and there is no way to turn up the brightness of the game at least from the game play menu or from the main menu. I also didn't like the third person view. On the zombie map it takes nearly 2-3 clips just to kill one zombie, also head shot does not make any of a difference. Sounds weird but one shot to the head makes their head explodes but yet they will still follow you around until you empty out 2-3 clips on them.
330	1	Works just as I remember it! I'm running a AMD 7770 with a Phenom II processor. I know it's not top of the line and that might be why it works on my machine. If you have a video card that is any newer than mine you might want to check around, but like I said it works great for me!
331	-1	I put some hours into this game, and it's a very nice looking game. But it boils down to the map size just being WAY too small.
332	-1	After finally getting the game to run under Windows 7, I was rather surprised to complete the entire game in about 10 hours.
333	1	Just as my title suggests, buying this digitally is much easier than buying one at the store. I understand that you can directly add funds to your PSN buy just putting your card number in, but i was having some problems with it and intern just bought this card. Once you pay for it here on Amazon it just gives the code ready to use.
334	0	Edited to condense, and take the personal rancor out of it.    Pros:  This game is fun to play.  I could feel the tension as my fragile squad tiptoed into a world filled with nasty people-eating baddies in every shadow.  Advance too quickly, you die.  Advance too slowly, everyone else dies and you lose. Range, line of sight, fire zones, proper use of cover, and the delicate balance between caution and aggression are all factors in making proper tactical decisions.    The technology progression is an integral part of the strategy element.  Put time and money into your interceptors or you can't shoot down UFOs.  Too much into your interceptors, and your troops will be underpowered, and lose the ground war.    Cons:  It has been made deliberately incompatible with Windows XP (Don't worry, you can find a workaround if you google it).  Floaters can be floating literally right over you, raining fire down on you, but you won't be able to see them.  The game decides there is no line of sight.  There is not very much variety to the missions.  You do the same thing over and over, which is why, even with settings to change and stats to randomize, replayability for me is somewhat limited.  The highest difficulty levels make it harder, but not better.      Other:  Installation took about 17 hours over 3Mb adsl.  My experience with Steam, which is *required* to run this game, has been the stuff of nightmares.  It did this attempted bit-torrent emulation, which spent most of its time waiting, and downloading something between a few Kb and absolutely nothing.  Also, your game installation location is locked into place when you install Steam.  There's no flexibility with it, even if you run out of room.  I had to uninstall and reinstall my entire steam library (not included in the 17 hours).  I've actually had to do that several times, as Steams seems to periodically just forget games that you have installed.he delicate balance between caution and aggression are all factors in making proper tactical decisions.<br /><br />If you advance too quickly, you may give the aliens free first shots on you when you find them.  If you don't advance quickly enough, you may fail the mission objectives, which can include protecting civilians, rescuing high value personnel, or disabling bombs before they explode.<br /><br />The technology progression is an integral part of the strategy element.  Fail to plan right, and the UFOs become too big for interceptors to shoot down.  Not only do the nation sponsors begin to feel panic, but then the UFOs you failed to shoot down come back and shoot down your satellites.  Invest too much in your UFOs though, and you may find your squad inadequate to the task of winning the war on the ground.<br /><br />Some downsides:<br /><br />Once you have played through a few missions, you will begin seeing familiar mission maps over again.  There don't appear to be all that many options.  I am still reasonably satisfied with the number and variety of maps, but I feel that it decreases its replayability for me in the long run.  More terrain than just city or forest would be nice too.  Rivers and Swamps could be fun.  Perhaps more content will be added here in the future?<br /><br />Line of sight can be glitchy, particularly with floaters.  They can be right in front of you, but if they are floating one or two space units above you, you may not have a valid line of sight to fire at them, even while they are raining fire on you.  Hopefully this gets patched.
335	0	This is a tough review to write.  The graphics are stunning and the story line interesting.  Truly, the only complaint I have about this game is that it is mainly ALL hidden object.  For every move you make, there's a HO scene to go through.  I prefer a more balanced game; after HO scene #10 I found myself just clicking around to get out of it. If you like a lot of HO scenes, then this is the game for you.
336	0	Although I have enjoyed Tomb Raider in past, this edition seemed more like a DVD movie animation with a bit of gaming thrown in. I found myself spending a lot of my gaming time with my hands resting on the arms of my chair. The cut scenes are too many and too long, in my opinion.<br /><br />Technically I had a couple of lock-up incidents at critical moments. However those seemed to abate when I lowered the graphics quality a bit.<br /><br />Regarding graphics; probably the strongest point of the game. The graphics are quite beautiful and nicely rendered.<br /><br />Overall gaming experience: Meh, pretty average.
337	1	This is a fine game on it's own, but if you (like me) are expecting it to be like Cradle of Persia, you will probably be disappointed.  It is a typical match-3-by-swapping-adjacent-tiles game and not a connect-the-matching-tiles game like COP.  Also, in my 30 minute trial, I noticed no bonus play.  You do, however build a city and collect power-ups by matching.  For me, though, this game was just too much like every other match 3 game I've played before.
338	-1	The download is from origin sadly. There was so much wrong with the software I was given. Even battle log wasn't working. I contacted origin and they still have not answered on how to fix it. I am extremely disappointed in this purchase.
339	1	Do you like pwning noobs? Of course you do. This card here allows you to do that. You buy it, you get the code, you put it into your xbox 360 menu crap, then bam! you can pwn noobs.  This card gives you 12 months.  12 MONTHS!  That's a whole year, guys. But wait, it gives you ONE MORE MONTH, giving you a grand total of 1 YEAR PLUS 1 MONTH.  You can destroy the little children and big noobs for a whole year and a month!  What more can you ask for?  Can't go wrong with this, guys.
340	-1	Program didn't even run on Steam. Useless.
341	-1	The game wouldnt even download amazon sucks. I would like for them to try to re-download the game its my son's favorite.
342	0	The game is good. However, still prefer battlefield3. Black ops is just shooting, not that fun. Although the zombies are very entertaining.
343	1	UPDATE THE SECOND: In case anyone was wondering, the game works fine with Lion.<br /><br />----<br /><br />UPDATE: After a lot of testing, I experience regular crashes when in the Warden's Peak (DLC) area, and ALSO when using the staff which comes from the area, elsewhere. The rest of the game w/o the staff seems to be back to perfect stability. Warden's Peak was still playable, just annoying. Save often. Hopefully there will be an update... though I wouldn't hold my breath. I don't believe that expansion was ever very reliable. This version may simply be emulating the Windows bugs a bit too well.<br /><br />----<br /><br />I bought the Standard Edition, and then the Ultimate Edition... and THEN it went on sale. (And this after buying it for the PS3 when it came out.) But I'm not too bitter. ;)<br /><br />I'm running the game on a 2011 base model iMac, and it works great, for the most part. I can put the resolution up to full, crank all the graphics, anti-aliasing, and textures up to the highest setting and use the frame-buffer effects. It looks fabulous and doesn't slow down any. It does crash on occasion, though, with all that on, especially in some of the DLC areas. It's a hard crash, too. You'll have to use the activity monitor to force quit, unless you want Dragon Age music playing in the background forevermore.<br /><br />I had no problems with the standard campaign, no matter what I turned up.<br /><br />However, it's still a fabulous game, and it looks great. I would not hesitate to buy it (obviously, heh) if you have a powerful mac and you're at all interested in RPGs. Just tone down the effects if you start noticing any crashes. With just full resolution, it still looks good and I have no problems.
344	1	This is cheaper than any I've seen. Was instant, no code problems, just enter and game on!! Really saved time and money!!
345	0	I've been a big fan of the Earth series since Earth 2140, so I was excited to finally get this at a discount. I had fun at first, but the more I played, the more issues became apparent. In a nutshell, the game feels like it was rushed.<br /><br />First of all, you're not allowed to play the UCS or alien campaigns until you complete both the ED and LC campaigns first. It doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but if your favorite faction has always been the UCS like me, it becomes really frustrating, especially when you get stuck on the ridiculously difficult final missions, especially for the LC campaign. More on that later.<br /><br />The story seemed like a good idea, but its execution leaves a lot to be desired. It's not so much the cheap animations with the goldfish mouth movements or even the terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE acting, but how uninspired and lacking the story itself is. Both the ED and UCS campaigns have one &#34;hero&#34; protagonist unit and both of them are betrayed by their respective corrupt governments. Earth 2150 had a more minimalist story without any characters or dialogue in it, but as the war progressed, you would get entertaining cutscenes about your progress. It's hard to beat StarCraft, sure, but blatantly ripping that game off is not the answer. Even the aliens, from their conception to some of their unit/building designs, seem like a pale imitation of the Zerg.<br /><br />The game is also plagued by bugs, despite having been patched several times already. One I noticed is that upgrading an LC battle module's weapon to the magneto piercing weapon or the ultrasonic wave emitter, it will NEVER fire on enemy units in range. The weapons work fine on any of the units that can equip them, but it's troubling how no one who could fix this was informed.<br /><br />Another major problem is something you don't notice until the final mission of the LC campaign, titled &#34;The Prisoners&#34;. Basically, you get 20 minutes to build up your base and forces before the AI starts raining ballistic missiles on your base. I had to restart this mission twice before figuring out that I had to build several Apollo missile defense units to intercept the missiles. But the problem persists. I built 30 (not a typo, THIRTY) units and built an effective net over my entire base. I thought that was the end of the problem, but no. I'm not exactly sure why, but my units seem to fail to intercept the ballistic missiles about 80% of the time. I move them around, I bunch them around where the missile hits, I move flying units closer so that they'd be able to &#34;see&#34; the missile coming earlier. It basically comes down to reloading at every failure, saving at every success and a lot of luck. One of your units has to be facing the right direction while in the right spot. It has to be a bug. If it was just an accuracy calculation, they would at least try to shoot the missiles down and miss. As it is, this issue is preventing me from accessing the UCS campaign. Maybe the missiles will stop eventually and I'll be able to rebuild the entire base, but I really don't have that much faith in the game being fair.<br /><br />The AI even gets to fire the missiles without having a unit around to set a target, while this game obtusely forces the player to have a unit in range. You can fire ballistic missiles anywhere in the map, but it's been my experience that if you don't see the enemy get destroyed by it by having a unit in range, you wasted your missile. This wasn't even an issue in the DOS version of Earth 2140. How could they mess it up so badly? Did they have any QA testing at all?<br /><br />There's a lot of other little things. Some things are counter-intuitive, like being given control of the Crion before you can research it and read the description that tells you it needs to land before it can fire. If you try to give a movement order with the uppermost or rightmost part of the minimap, the screen will annoyingly scroll up or right respectively. The campaign missions lack variety. The UCS doesn't show up once in the ED campaign, which is inexcusable. The campaigns are also rather short at 7 missions per faction, so just as you finish unlocking all of the technologies, you barely get to use them.<br /><br />As for multiplayer, I haven't tried it. I had to wait a weekend after contacting GOG to send me an activation code, but it doesn't connect to the server at all. I'm sure there are private servers to connect to, but it just doesn't work out of the box.<br /><br />On the plus side, the graphics and animations look really good for the most part. You can customize your key mapping, unlike so many modern PC games ported from console development. And the game is actually pretty fun when you're not dealing with one of its many issues. It's just that there are better 3D RTS options with more polish and less problems. Like Earth 2150.
346	1	Very good game, the stories is very well told and the possibility of open world is great! Encnata I am totally satisfied with this new release
347	-1	This morning I wanted to make a couple of batches of cookies, but the timer on my kenmore oven had broke yet again.  It's a fantastic recipe from a friend whose family has been making these ginger snaps for generations and they taste fantastic.<br /><br />Doing some research, I found a large number of indications that the wait for the servers to respond to this game is 20 minutes.  Not wanting to wait for Amazon's super fast prime delivery or venture out on a windy day, I quickly purchased and downloaded this game.<br /><br />Every single batch of my cookies have burnt.  Now, I still can't play the game and my house smells like burnt failure.
348	0	"I ran into all kinds of problems when trying to run LA Noire. I looked all over the internet for a solution but nothing worked... until I realized something.<br /><br />When I started LANoire (after installing the mandatory patch and having the game not work) I went to the LANLauncher -> Options -> Renderer. It was defaulted to DirectX 9. I CLICKED THE DROP BOX AND SELECTED DIRECTX 11.<br /><br />I then started the game and everything worked! The game is still not running smoothly due to poor frame rates, but I am finally able to play. You should still \\""run as administrator\\"" when you boot up the game.<br /><br />I hope this helps!"
349	1	This is without a doubt the best Castlevania game ever made.  The story and voice acting are top notch.  With that being said this is not a child's game,  is definetly rated M for a reason.  The graphics are amazing which allows for amazing visuals, fluid combat and awsome violence when killing demons.  Also, the weapons and the upgrades are awesome,  you will love this game.  Finally, they are going to be making Lords of Shadow II, judging how good this game is, I will probably get that as well.  Get it you won't be disappointed.  Purchase it on Amazon, activate the Key on Steam and download it. (Best way to get it.)
350	0	I did not give it a 5 star rating because you guys should give at least a 1,000 more funds on that starter pack. On BFH forums people get 5k for 6$ & I know you guys know this but I think that if you guys gives 1k funds more on the small pack it will sell more.
351	0	"This game is okay. I have most of the \\""diner dash\\"" games and enjoy those. This one seems quite a bit less intriguing to me. If you like things to do over and over and just not think (which is what most of the diner dash games are). However, with the Diner Dash games you actually get to use some strategy, such as choosing which type of \\""power up\\"" you would like and on some of them you get to choose what order you get to do the decorations in and such. My favorite of the Diner Dash games is \\""Cooking Dash.\\""  I would recommend that game over this one. I just wish that I could find a game that had a little more to it.    If anyone knows of a game that has more thinking involved and not just repetition I would appreciate recommendations!! Thanks!    I should add that for the price of $6.99 (I have read others getting .99 games--I haven't come across any of those) it isn't that bad of a deal. Not to mention it can be downloaded immediately and you don't have to wait for it to come in the mail."
352	-1	While the updated graphics engine is top notch, the porting of this console-based classic is wrought with problems that are too distracting to ignore.  At first the control-scheme lags--something you simply won't used to if you are fan of the fast-paced arcade action of the earlier titles--but somehow, at least for me, all of my buttons have been remapped and there is no way to reassign them without going into the coding itself; and even then I have not been successful in reassigning the controller buttons.  Of course, since the Logitech controller I am using worked just fine from the beginning (and does not experience any problems when I use it with, say, emulators) this issue is too great to overlook.  Coupled with the fact that Steam has not responded to my inquiry as to how the button-mapping problem could have occurred in the first place and what I can do to remedy the situation and I am ready to dismiss Steam as a legitimate entertainment provider.<br /><br />I was greatly looking forward to enjoying some reminiscent THPS action, especially in some of my favorite levels, but it seems that the team(s) behind this port care not about the die-hard fans of the original series.
353	0	didn't magically turn me into a Rocksmith  like it says but ok.  We can't all be Stevie Ray Vaughan
354	1	did the job.
355	0	This game is fun, and I learned how to play Spades using this game! It's a great way to learn the game if you've never played Spades before. However, the game is very unimpressive visually. The resolution is low. The graphics are bad quality. And as another reviewer stated, you can't see the final score! I'm not quite sure how they overlooked that problem. But, the game is still a lot of fun to play, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.
356	0	"I purchased this because I really enjoy aquariums and the ambiance they create, but don't have the time to keep up with a real one.  It is relaxing to have the aquarium running on my tv while doing things around the house.  My 7 year old likes to feed \\""his\\"" fish and just look at them.  Overall not a bad product and affordable enough to take the risk to see if you like it.  If you like aquariums, you'll like this download."
357	0	Honestly not too impressed with this game. its just your typical run of the mill, little creativity. boarderlands is a way better game of this style pluss is has multiplayer capability. but i recoment buying the platform version. but then again im not really a pc gamer.
358	-1	I have a new computer and this game still has given me so many issues I don't even know where to begin.  (Not to mention NO live tech support)  I'll just share the final issue; I finally bought the game because after three days of trying different stuff I couldn't get the 7 day free trial to work.  THEN the game works fine.  NOW it tells me my 7 day trial is over go buy the game.  WTF! I already bought the game!  I don't have much time to play vids and for the money I spend I expect a product that works when I want to use it.  Two Thumbs way down.
359	1	While I could save a few extra bucks looking for the $35/year deals I just don't have the time to watch and jump on those deals.  This membership was a great value for the cost saving me at least a few bucks and I don't have to worry about renewal for a while now.
360	-1	I thought I could handle an aged game. I was wrong....
361	1	Easy to buy and delivery almost instantly! Very good alternative if you dont have a shop near you, and you save 1 cent
362	0	you need a controller if you want to play this game, i had it for playstation then got rid of it but bought this agian and is pretty much impossible to play without a controller... and i'm a pc gamer and this is impossible to play with out one, but other than that really fun game it gets a 5 stars for game wise but for pc 3, considering u NEED a controller
363	1	Fast n easy
364	0	It is really really fun, a great price, but for me it is really hard. I got it because i watched Pewdiepie play it and i it looked fun, but i just get pissed cause i cant do that arrow, number key, thing.
365	0	Some new stuff, but nothing amazing.<br />New planes<br />New locations<br />A Couple New management items.<br /><br />Glad I was able to get this for free with some amazon credit, I would have been upset if I paid for it.
366	-1	A bad launch combine with EA's horrible support and attitude is unacceptable.  The game is a pretty sorry state, in order to allow people to log some functions have been disabled.<br /><br />  The logic used to model traffic seems very odd.  Drivers can be seen pulling U-turns constantly at intersections clogging traffic and sometimes just stopping in the middle of the road altogether causing gridlock behind them.  Water is not being replenished by rain and trade depots stop trading.  It's been a laundry list of problems.
367	0	This game could be epic if they included bigger maps. I actually really enjoy the game and really want to give it five stars, but without bigger maps I just cant do it.
368	1	Excitement and excelent game!!! We can use all kind of weapons, contundents, knives, swords or firearms, and the adventure and story is very good...
369	1	Really good bundle, it´s a must have for 12 bucks.<br />It´s a shame that Borderlands 2 is not goty but it´s still a very good offer.
370	0	They've taken a great game & over-engineered it... plays like a barge rather than a fast destroyer...really miss the ability to go where you want on the star map as they've added &#34;missions&#34; for movement.
371	0	I pre-ordered this game after a friend pressured me in to playing with him.  As a very veteran MMO player I didn't expect much, as the genre has low standards.  I found that the game was certainly worth the initial cost to play until you &#34;beat&#34; it like a single player game.  The class system was somewhat interesting, while the crafting was tedious.  Overall, you can get about 100 hours of enjoyable game play from it, but then it becomes the same old tedious cookie cutter MMO.
372	0	Great game, no so great port. The issues can be fixed for the most part however with additional software i.e. DSFix
373	1	"This is the first simulation game I have ever owned, and it is much more fun than I expected. You earn \\""cash\\"" for fish, decorative and comfort items for your fish tanks by playing what turned out for me to be an addictive little game that gets progressively harder. I have two tanks set up now, and use them as screen savers. My only concern is that once all the tanks have been set up, there is not much else to do. Still, for $6.99, the game is well worth it."
374	0	In answer to a previous reviewer, I had no trouble running the game - it only shows Windows XP, but it does work with Vista.    I rather liked this early installment in the MCF series - the hunt for objects is challenging, and unlike Madame Fate and the two Ravenhurst games, the mini-games aren't impossible, twisted logic horrors but jigsaw puzzles with a bit of added difficulty:  you have a picture of the scene to guide you, but the puzzle parts also show the crime scene, so some pieces don't match the picture.    I decided not to buy the game because it doesn't have a 'relaxed' mode, and I want to take my time and really search for the things I can't find.
375	-1	Its hard to navigate and its not very clear what you need to do, i stopped playing after 5 minutes it was the worst game i ever decided to download, dont bother wasting your money
376	-1	Cannot access it!
377	-1	After over 10 hours of mucking about with email and IRC and the like, I was unable to get the game registered at all.  It seems that EA/FunCom will accept the registration code from Amazon, but they'd also like you to pay the full amount to them as well.  There is no telephone support at all.  Over 5 email conversations, all boilerplate, asked me to log in and contact in-game support (which you can't do until you register).  I was also referred to their IRC live talk channel -- turns out it's apparently discontinued or chronically unavailable, with no ETA for up again.  In the end I cancelled the transaction.  Never was able to get it to fly.<br /><br />Amazon did splendidly on this, btw.  Their people tried hard to help and, when it was clear this was a no-go, they handled refunding quickly, easily and politely.
378	1	Excellent
379	-1	WE  FAMILIY FEUD I AND FAMILY FEUD IIBUY THIS PORDUCT AND THIS TRASH NOT WORK DO NOT BUY THIS THINK WE TRY MANY  WAY TO FIX  IF NOT SOLUTION WE WANT MY MONEY BACK.
380	0	The game I bought through Amazon is fine.  I have three earlier games in the same series that I bought through the original publisher.  For some reason I bought this one through Amazon but will never buy another game through them.  The original three I bought downloaded and installed quickly and easily.  This one DID NOT.  Every time I want to play I have to uninstall and then reinstall in order for it to load.  Plus the Amazon game bar has to be reinstalled.  I have bought many games - mostly through BigFish and Oberon - and have never had this problem before.  It is very disappointing. This happens on both my laptop and desktop, running Windows 7.
381	-1	code was already used
382	-1	I received the game code instantly - unfortunately it was invalid/already used. [[ASIN:B004RMK4BC Sony Playstation Network Card - $20 [Online Game Code]]]
383	-1	I don't like the game. It is suppose to be played on your computer but unless you have a remote controller you can't play it. I deleted it and probably won't download another game I have to pay for.
384	1	I got the second game first and liked it so much I tried this one.  While this is a lot of fun (and a lot harder), the second one is superior in a lot of ways (e.g. more weapons, better story, and longer).  Of course this one is a third the price of [[ASIN:B003N3U5RY Alien Shooter II - Vengeance]], but if you hunt around you can find Alien Shooter 2 - Reloaded, which is basically the same game with a few tweaks and a couple of extra levels you might find a deal; I got my copy for $5.<br /><br />Anyway, as the title suggests you spend the majority of your time shooting aliens.  There's not much story here, a lab has been overrun and you have to clean it out.  You get to use a handgun (unlimited ammo weak uzi), shotgun, grenade launcher, mini-guns, rocket launcher, freeze thrower, laser weapon, a flame thrower, and an energy mini-gun thing.  Money can be used to purchase the weapons upgrades, armor, or skill enhancing implants.  It's scarce though and mostly you can find everything in the next level you go to anyway, especially if you find the secret areas (hint shoot every wall) which have weapons, cash, and/or goodies.<br /><br />Where I was just running through killing things in Reloaded, here I had to keep drawing guys out slowly and killing them.  It's not hard, their AI is pretty weak and they'll get stuck on things a lot.  I do give the developers credit, looks like they redid almost all the enemies from this game because they're different.  If you ever played the old Contra games, you more or less have an idea what type of game this is.  It's isometric 3D with limited ammo (except the uzi) which is fine, but the walls are sometimes narrow and not transparent so you can start getting hit by a guy you can't see sometimes.  Add to that the enemies that spit goo on the ground that stays for quite a while and you can quickly get painted into a corner and be dead before you know what hit you.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that there are some later levels here where the enemy keeps teleporting in and you have to run past the teleporters to get the explosives to blow them up.  The experience was just plain frustrating and cheap.  It's pretty much a way to guarantee you have to spend money on armor, medkits or something, or else it's next to if not impossible to complete.  Fortunately, it's only one level that's REALLY bad.  Tip:  Make good use of the freeze ray when running past the teleporters.  The final level gets really cheap with [[ASIN:B003GEI6LW Serious Sam]] style enemy warping in behind you ambushes.  I don't mind a challenge, but I in my opinion the design was just laziness in creating a challenge on the developer's part.<br /><br />For $5, this is a pretty fun game that will run on even older desktops and most likely old laptops as well.  Definitely worth the money.eps teleporting in and you have to run past the teleporters to get the explosives to blow them up.  The experience was just plain frustrating and cheap.

385	1	Works
386	-1	It keeps crashing.<br /><br />I have wanted to play this game for some time now, and now that i found it on amazon<br />i thought i would finally give it a try.<br /><br />And it doesnt work.
387	1	Yes, these are steam keys, and yes this series is amazing. I recommend the series to anyone who loves sci-fi or shooter games.
388	-1	I have gotten the code but once inputting into my system I am presented by a banner prompts me that &#34;the code I entered may not be correct or may no longer be valid&#34;.. I had was really looking forward to this moment until I ended up frustrated and annoyed and short of $50.. I would really appreciate it if you could settle this issue..
389	1	Excellent game with lots of fun and challenging puzzles. Excellent for all ages, including adults!
390	1	A very captivating game that can be played for hours at a time.  The game exceeded my expectations.
391	1	I bought this game when it was initially released, and I have loved it ever since. In this package, you get both the original game (Sim City 4) and its expansion (Rush Hour). The game shows its age, but still works great for a 10+ year old game after a few necessary tweaks. Join any SimCity 4 community ( Simtropolis, SimCity4Devotion, or /r/SimCity) and they will point you in the right direction for finding the mods that have been released over the years to adapt it to evolving computer specifications.
392	0	The kids like Pac Man and they have fun with it.  We like to play it with them too but can not figure out how to do 2 player.  If it could do that, I would give it a 5+!
393	-1	"I wish i had read the \\""con\\"" reviews before i purchased this puzzle. Sure, it's a decent price, but it has some SERIOUS glitches. On Vista, it's too small to really see well, so i couldn't use it on my computer. On my friend's Window 7 o.s. it is a nice full screen, but as someone else has written, if you hover too long on a piece, it turns black and sort of pixelates. The entire puzzle turned black at one point, but i clicked an empty space and it came back. When you choose a puzzle, it won't let you change your mind and go back to the gallery. I had to do the \\""control, alt, delete thing\\"" to end the program and then go back to the gallery to pick another puzzle. You can't save the finished puzzle to your computer, though you can make a nice desktop wallpaper from it. It's very frustrating and i really don't think it's worth the $7 i paid for it. I'm searching for a new puzzle download to take its place and you can be sure that i will read the reviews on it before i purchase it."
394	-1	The Sims 3: Supernatural is not for everyone. You might very well enjoy having the ability to create vampires, werewolves, fairies, ghosts, etc. that each have their own unique abilities. However, my biggest problem with the expansion was when I wanted to play with normal Sims. I didn't like that how during the full moon, zombies could come out of the ground or werewolves and vampires could turn normal Sims. For this reason, I ended up disabling it in the options. I didn't like it but you very well might depending on your play style.
395	-1	Pretty pissed about this, I paid, and went to download and this garbage pulled up saying I had to sign up with Steam.  They should offer a search option to eliminate steam games, and they should put (steam) in the title, had I known it was a steam game I wouldn't have wasted my money.  When I buy a game I want to play, I don't want added online garbage that I am forced to do, and then put up with SPAM and steam trying to load and update all the time.  Pretty sneaky way to force this garbage.<br /><br />Amazon refunded my money on this garbage, they were helpful, but I will think twice and look everywhere before I would buy another game from amazon, if it involves steam or any other online bs I won't buy anymore.
396	0	Write up later
397	0	It's easily better than the Harley Quinn dlc and the Red Hood dlc
398	-1	Game is rather boring. Didn't play more than 1/2 hour
399	0	I hope I can get the base game ons day.<br />I played it but that was the cracked version from skidrow.
400	1	Excelent all products u can buy whit that and is so easy
401	-1	I suppose it's a decent game, but I found it hard to play on my pc, it's not typically my type of genre.
402	0	Its a fun game BUT it keeps crashing! and steam support wont help me! this sucks i have something unplayable sitting on my hardrive
403	0	I first installed this on my laptop running Windows 7 Home premium. It installed and ran OK, but now it hangs up on the splash screen. I have uninstalled the program, and reinstalled it, but I cannot get it to run again. I have even uninstalled it, used system restore to a previous state, re-downloaded the file and installed it fresh, and it still hangs up when starting.<br /><br />I have installed it on another Windows 7 machine, and it runs OK. It will not remember any new players I create. I have installed it on one of my Windows XP machines, and that install will remember new players. I am a bit disappointed, because the laptop is the machine I most wanted it to run on.<br /><br />There are virtually no help or instruction files that work, so if you don't already know how to play, you may be out of luck.
404	0	Third time is supposed to be the charm.  Didn't work.  Am becoming annoyed.
405	1	Great
406	-1	On Windows 7, even emulating Windows XP Service Pack 3, this game was unable to run for more than two to three days before it simply would no longer load.  Initially, uninstalling and reinstalling worked, but even this fix stopped working.  It didn't run well on XP, so I guess 7 shouldn't be any different.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
407	-1	Doesn't anyone notice that the bundle price is higher than the individual price of buying the games seperately?  Sure, it's only $15 more, but seriously does everyone want ALL of the games, or just buying because they think it's cheaper?
408	-1	Can a game be great if no one ever gets to play it? NOPE!! The few instances I have gotten to play the game have been really addicting and fun. There are a bunch of things I would like them to change about the game like city size, ability to share resources with cities in your region not attached by road, etc... but I can't even begin to start hoping they fix those issues until the game actually works. One friend can't get his game to even launch, I can't get my city to load, and the other friend will get into his city only to get kicked out 10 minutes later. There are tons if issues, including the server instabilities and wait times. If you buy this game before they fix everything you're throwing away your money. Don't support this company until they show they care enough to fix their problems. How could they not plan for this at all? Beta testing is supposed to be where you get all your crap fixed, but obviously someone forgot to tell EA what the purpose of a Beta is.
409	0	I can't give this a high rating because even though it works exactly as described, it is a rip-off. It is complete garbage that I have to pay Microsoft $50 a year for X-Box Live &#34;Gold&#34; just so i can access my Amazon Prime, Netflix, and other premium video sharing accounts that I already have to pay for. I am not even using Xbox live for gaming- these other services don't cost Microsoft anything- they are available on televisions and bluray players, Roku boxes, the new Amazon Fire TV even. My next TV will have these apps built in and then I can finally drop Xbox Live Gold completely. Until then these cards offer better value and I don't have to keep a valid credit card on file with Microsoft.
410	-1	The installer, as sold by Amazon, did not work for me.<br />I got error messages, and could not play the game.<br /><br />Luckily, some hackers have gotten the game working, and you can find 'fixes' on the internet.<br /><br />This game is actually really fun! But don't buy it here, if you are averse to finding shady cracked fixes to get it working on your PC. From what I read on the internet, a lot of people had the same error I had.
411	0	I caught this game on sale for $10. I can definitely say for that price, I'm happy. I would  have been pretty disappointed if I'd paid anything more than that though. There just aren't that many new changes to warrant a completely seperate game, more like an expansion.<br /><br /> No improvement in graphics. No major game mechanic changes, just some new buildings and a couple of minor features added. Good changes, yes. All good improvements, just not what I was hoping for in a new game.
412	-1	An absolute waste of time and money. No extra soldier and just the ability to alter appearances of the men.
413	-1	"The SimCity franchise has been a part of my life since the very beginning of my experience with computers with the original SimCity, followed by 2000, 3000 and SimCity 4, all of which have provided me with hundreds and hundreds of valuable hours of entertainment. Imagine my delight when this, the fifth SimCity (perplexingly named the same as the original) was announced. Finally, another SimCity game! (Societies didn't count, that was more \\""The Sims\\"" City than it was SimCity)<br /><br />Alas, the game is useless to me. The game requires an internet connection at all times while playing, not just at launch, and there is no possibility of enabling offline mode like you can with Steam. EA, therefore, either assumes that we are all playing this game from a place with a reliable internet connection and we never move or travel, or, more critically, that we are all criminals who would rather pirate the game we love than pay for it.<br /><br />Traveling is a big part of my life - they've even invented computers for it, known as \\""laptops.\\"" Someone should inform EA of that fact, because it seems like they completely overlooked the potential that I would want to move my portable computer from its home in the land of abundant WiFi and venture out into the world beyond.<br /><br />I know I'm a nerd, but even sometimes I like to see the outside world.<br /><br />This $60 game is therefore wasted, as I can't play SimCity on the train, at hotels without WiFi, in airports, etc. All because EA requires a constant-on internet connection, something I rarely have outside the comfort of my home.<br /><br />Put simply, as a lifelong SimCity fan, I feel robbed. Cheated of the franchise that shaped my childhood, all because I dare venture into the outside world of unpredictable WiFi."
414	1	Nice game.  Good variety and creative puzzles.  They have really nice puzzles at the end once the game is completed.
415	1	Perfect
416	1	all its perfect
417	0	I waited for a long time to get PAE1 discounted in the Deal of the Week program (It went for 50% off) on Xbox Live because 1600 points or $20 seemed like WAY to much to me for an Xbox Live Arcade game.  I'm glad I did because I would have been pretty angry if I paid full price.  If you are a veteran RPG player you will rip through this game in a few hours or so.  Maybe it'll take you a bit longer if you're going for the achievements.    Pros:  Limited character creation, but your character looks great & is in every cut scene just how you made it. Has a very cool stylized look to it.  Fun & fast combat system once you learn how to block.  There are a lot of little details everywhere.  Click and explore everything.  Easy 200 Achievement points for a veteran RPG player.    Cons:  Overpriced & much shorter than I expected.  Beat everything in one play through and has ZERO replayability. Literally, it warns you before you beat the last boss that once you win it's over.  Before you learn how to time your blocks properly you will die, alot.  Lame story with a cliffhanger leading you to buy PAE2.  Not as funny as I thought it would be and is NOT for a child it has mature content & very strong language.    Overall, I enjoyed it while it lasted, but I'd say I was disappointed with PAE1 because it was so short and wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.
418	0	It's not as much fun as the first, but it's still a fun grindy-outy-itemy shooter.
419	-1	Been looking to play somthing on my new ps4 so i tried this game that turned very very boring played 2 min and never tried again
420	-1	it has been one day still don't have it.my grandson is waiting to play with it.  I will never buy this again
421	1	The original Borderlands was already a terrific game. It came totally out of nowhere and won everybody's heart with its comic-like looks and bizarre sense of humor, and earned itself a high place among the games of that year.<br /><br />So when 2K announced Borderlands 2, everyone was expectedly thrilled and expected much from the franchise. And they didn't dissapoint. Borderlands is a great game, not without its faults (slow at times, grinding is kinda mandatory, repetitive), but still a great game. Borderlands 2 took all that was good about the first one and improved it, and took all that was bad and polished it. The only bad thing about this game, and really all games of this generation, is the presence of DLC. But the difference is that DLC for Borderlands 2 is truly amazing. It is long, it has new everything, and is truly worth the money they ask. But still, DLC.<br /><br />Anyways, get these games. You will never regret it.
422	-1	We are in the update 10.0 and there are A LOT of bugs still in the game.<br />Some core, essential mechanics doesn't work just yet.<br />The city sizes are super, hiper, mega small! I call this game Simtown!
423	0	Graphics are pretty bad, but then again, this game is kind of old now and the graphics just could have been that bad back in the day.  But still an old game recovered.
424	-1	Just purchased the game and tried downloading 20+ times but it does not work. Hate it the process now .......
425	1	It very Good game worth every cent and I remember this game to every-one it very good game...a lot of fun
426	0	average
427	-1	This review is for Mac users running Lion (10.7.5): do not buy. I bought this game a short while back, and recently the developer changed the game on Steam so that it will no longer run on Lion. After some emails back and forth, it seems they are not willing to refund my money, nor are they willing to release a Lion version for those of us who bought a functioning game with good hard cash that no longer works.<br /><br />Too bad, too. I was getting into it. Now I will never buy another game from Kalypso.
428	-1	I am so glad that I didn't buy this game.  Once downloaded, you can't get past the opening screen.  I kept clicking to start a game, but the profiles screen kept appearing.  I chose a profile, only to be sent back to the main screen again.  The same thing happened over and over.  I consider myself a seasoned veteran of hidden object games, having downloaded and played so many.  Therefore, I recognize a glitch when I see one.
429	1	Why yes, Amazon.  Yes it did meet my expectations.  I expected to get 560 BioWare points, and indeed I got exactly 560 BioWare points.  It certainly would have fallen below my expectations had I gotten 559 BioWare points, and would have exceeded my expectations had I ended up with 561 BioWare points.  But not to worry, as neither of those expectation-shattering incidents came to pass.  As such my expectations were precisely met.  As I expected.
430	0	I download this on my laptop which is about 1 or 2 years old and i try to play the game but. It runs extreamly slow is know that my laptop can handle this game like a piece of cake. I also have fallout 2, and tactics, (i got them from a diffrent website) and those games run butter smooth. But this one dosen't if anyone knows how to fix this problem please tell me. Besides the problem i think this game is a very good game and you should buy it.
431	0	Once you have it go to origin and then  go to the top left corner and then go to origin click on the and then add game then add your code in then download and boom but much easier to download through amazon! Fun game though
432	0	Outside of all the technical problems and bugs still present in the game, it still falls short of the Sim city name. Instead of an advanced city simulator we're left with a simple version of ths previous games that isn't worth your time or money.
433	-1	I bought, downloaded and installed this only to never be able to open the application. Then I find out it doesn't work on Lion. WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THAT IN THE DESCRIPTION?! Don't buy this if you have Lion.
434	-1	I downloaded this because I love the first one.  It didn't install into my computer.  SO I can't really review the game.  I contacted Atari more then six times and got no response from them.  SO I have given up on trying to buy this since Atari seems to have given up on its customers.  Thank God Amazon has a great customer service.  They refunded my money with no questions or anything just gave it back.  Thanks amazon EPIC FAIL ON ATARIS END
435	1	Love it, works real good.  I buy one every year for my kids.  It keeps them busy and enables them to use Netflix on the xbox which makes them happy too.
436	1	Great game. Glad I could get it on sale. Very fun combat and some crazy enemies to use it on.
437	1	Quick & easy... Perfect!
438	1	Amazing bundle. All the games are pretty good EXCEPT Homefront.<br /><br />Homefront is pretty bad. Do not recommend it.<br /><br />The other games are fantastic.
439	1	Great game
440	-1	This is the 4th game i've bought from amazon that has a corrupted download please fix this, its very annoying
441	0	It was a fun little game, if you enjoy the seek and find type of casual games, which I do. It has enough going on to keep you interested without getting to the point that it's frustrating, like some can get. I like playing these kinds of games to relax and take my mind of the trials of the day. This game certainly filled that bill. I especially enjoyed interaction with the customers. I would have given this a higher mark, but the game was just too short. I was finished with the game that same night I bought it.
442	1	Bought it and it was ok. i will buy another when i need to. six five four three two one
443	0	Easy to get bored of, but fun.
444	-1	for some reason microsoft is unable to explain i cannot use this on my account even though they checked and the code is valid and unused.  I have had multiple issues with my xbox one and am realizing it was a bad decision to purchase one within the first year.  It is still somewhat broken.  They are releasing an update a month to fix all of the issues yet still not working properly and inferior to both the 360 and the PS4 as I own both I can honestly say so.
445	1	i's a good purchase for those ps3 gamers who enjoy the console like me, i recomend it. It doesn't fail
446	-1	This has got to be the worst game that I have ever played. When accessing some of the puzzles there is no way to back out of the puzzle if you are stuck and out of hints. This game will immediately put you to sleep. If you are given an alternative to die for play this game, take the bullet it will be a lot less ppainful.
447	0	not enough details
448	0	I was disappointed to find after purchasing the PC version that the local multiplayer split screen feature on consoles is not included in the PC version.
449	-1	Wish I had listened to the reviews, guess I just had to see it for myself since I liked the previous games. It was fun for the first couple hours, until you experience how extremely small the regions are. The map size limits the gameplay so much that it ruins the experience of what Sim City was all about. Forget building a humongous metropolis on one map. Most maps you don't even have room to have RCI on the same map, Everything has to be so close together that you can't have industry and pollution on the outskirts of your city. You end up having to create almost exclusively industrial or residential cities, and trying to get your Sims to commute. Essentially, it feels like a dumbed down, condensed, and casual version of Sim City 4 with tiny maps.<br /><br />Now that might be fun for small periods of time, if it wasn't for the terrible server issues. I made three cities in one region. First city was going ok, but after six hours into the first city, it experienced a processing error with EA's servers and had to be rolled back two hours. Then it happened again... and again. I started a new city, and this time it happened after only two hours. I figured maybe if I started a private city it would be different. Wrong. After another few hours it rolled back again. After losing three cities to this poor excuse for a SimCity game I'm done, can't do it. I don't even want to start another game, because I know eventually I'll either get a server issue, or just run out of space, again, and have to start demolishing my city just to fit basic buildings. It's a terrible, terrible game for anyone who liked the previous iterations, and I would stay far away.<br /><br />TL;DR, pure garbage, don't buy.<br />Filed for a refund, first time for everything.
450	1	I really enjoyed this game.  It's very much in keeping with the previous Agatha Christie hidden-object game titles, with comics-style graphic representations of the story (i.e. no voice actors).  You conduct an 'investigation' which involves finding objects in various locations, then solving a mini-game before proceeding to the next Chapter.  Most of the objects are pretty easy to find, with the exception of one or two in each Chapter that are next to impossible, so that keeps it interesting.  Also a little new (to me), is that some of the objects you need to find are animated, so be aware you may need to grab hold of something scurrying by.    The mini-games are pretty simple (of the jigsaw puzzle, matching tiles variety) and can be skipped with no penalty.  Each Chapter allows you five hints which refresh after each chapter.  The Chapters are timed, but I never came close to  needing all the time allotted so it's not particularly stressful.    Some scenes have some minor blood and gore, nothing alarming just probably not for very young kids.  There is a murder after all!    I had read this book some time ago and recognize many of the plot details, it seemed to me the game actually followed the plot of the book pretty closely.  Kudos to the game makers for that~
451	1	Great atmosphere of Hong Kong and triad wars.<br />A little bad optimization of graphics for PC - game is laggy at some moments.
452	-1	did not install, it had an error and would not install. so i don't know any think about the game play.
453	-1	more hird party crap
454	1	"I'm currently playing the campaign and enjoying it very much.  I also played Disciples II which was alot of fun.  However, I'm concerned about ongoing support for this series.  I found the below information in a Kalypso media forum and posting it for your information. Link is  [...]    ____________    Support for Disciples III discontinued  Some of you guys probably still looking for support here, but unfortunately, it looks like this Disciples III's support has been discontinued by Kalypso. No new patches will be released by the developer or publisher in the foreseeable future.    The developer of this product, .dat games, has closed down. And it looks like the official RU website of the product has been closed down too. However, the product's planned add-on, \\""Resurrection of Mortis\\"" is still listed on the \\""In Development\\"" list (it has already been released in Russian, if I'm not mistaken).  ____________    Edit: 9/12/12 :  Contrary to some of the whiners of this game, it is not \\""full\\"" of bugs.  The download from Amazon is up to the latest patch version available.  I just this past week played completely through the campaign for a second time (total of over 60+ hours) for both times I have played it.  During this entire time I had a total of three game hang-ups, which in my opinion is totally acceptable.  If you experience many hangs and bugs, I suspect your computer system is not up to snuff and has old drivers, viruses, etc.  I love this very fun, turn-based series and hope a new developer will eventually continue with new releases.    ____________"
455	-1	Big Deal.  Who has XP anymore? Had to give one star but it deserves 0.

Most likely written for boys since main character is a boy, but girls may enjoy it too.  Fun puzzles,challenges and hidden objects game.<br /><br />Spirit of Wandering is too large for my notebook. The game did not allow me to play in a window and full screen cut off the bottom of the screen, preventing me from using the tools and picking up any items at the bottom of the screen,thus preventing me from playing.<br /><br />Mortlake Manor had an interesting story, hidden objects mixed with puzzles that need to be solved before you can move on in the game.  Most puzzles can be skipped, the ones that can't be skipped are easy enough to solve. I didn't play the difficult level, so I don't know about the puzzles in that level.  There is no skip dialogue button, but if you click in the dialogue balloons, you can cut off what the character is saying if you want.<br /><br />A few caveats:<br /><br />1) Make sure you pick up everything you need in a room before leaving.  If the game registers the room as complete, there's no telling which room you left the item in and when you need the item, you can't proceed in the game if you can't find it.  Even if you go to the room you think it's in, the help button will only tell you \\""there's nothing more to do here\\""<br /><br />2) In the nursery, you have to screw in the handle holders on the wardrobe. If you accidentally double tap when inserting a screw, you have just inserted 2 screws into 1 hole.  There is no getting it out.  You won't be able to open the wardrobe once you get the handles, and you can't proceed further.  That's the end of the game for you.  There are no do overs.  The only way to try again is to exit the game, delete, then recreate yourself and start from the beginning.<br /><br />3) Here's where the custom arrow is really a drag.  You've solved all the puzzles and gotten to the last scene of the game.  There is a race between you and your adversary to click on items.

You've solved all the puzzles and gotten to the last scene of the game.  There is a race between you and your adversary to click on items.

457	1	This game is amazingly fun and the deal was an absolute steal! I would definitely recommend it to other people.
458	1	Lots of fun!  A little weak in the beginning but as the game progresses lots of customers and the challange picks up.
459	0	decent game 3/5
460	-1	I read all the complaints about the always on requirement and thought, well how bad can it be? So much worse than I could have ever imagined.<br /><br />There are so many reviews that I won't bother going into all the problems, as I'm sure they match everyone else. But a real deal breaker to me is that you can't save your game and roll back. I've been playing Simcity games since I rented part 1 on my Super Nintendo in 1993. One thing that has always been fun is the ability to make a city, and then try something risky or stupid, like creating an earthquake, then reload your saved game after you play around. Well not anymore. Saves are stored server side, so if you do something, it's permanent. Maybe this doesn't seem like a big deal to you, but to me it's just absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />I want to love this game. I really want to. But sadly at this time, I can't. I can't recommend this game with the always on internet drm and the problems it creates.<br /><br />Sorry Will Wright and Maxis. You have lost me as a fan.
461	1	I am not much of a video game enthusiast but I thoroughly have enjoyed my experience with Bastion. It's graphics are fun and inventive and at times even trippy. The main protagonist follows an interesting story with a Samuel Jackson esque sounding narrator following him every step of the way. The weapon choices are many and the game plays on the RPG leveling and experience building made famous by FF. The entire universe follows your character and forms a pathway of an area around him. At times this can make the game a little overwhelming with 30 or more villains chasing you down. But this is part of the fun of the experience. Bastion is overall a fantastic game that is fun and focuses on quality over quantity. A+
462	1	As always, Amazon delivers the goods at a slightly lower cost than gaming stores and other sellers.  What you want at a good price.
463	0	Not necessarily better - different.  Mostly because of the features the newer OS provides vice the old DOS game.  I notice it doesn't show the score - or maybe I haven't found it.  How many folks know that sitting on the whoopie cusion gives you a point if you can't see the score.
464	0	The Yuriko Omega storyline is predictable, but the gameplay mechanics are a fun new way of playing Red Alert. Overpowering droves of enemies, some of them capable of leveling entire bases, is satisfying mindless fun :D
465	-1	Nothing special
466	-1	The code for the prepaid card is incorrect or no longer v&aacute;lido.este is the comment that I get, I can not use this code. how I could help
467	0	Well, this seemed to be a classic alien shoot em up game with some nice guns and unique features. Destructible environments, which also repairable. I had the graphics settings maxed out with 1080p and dont know why it would make my radeon hd 5770 slow down a bit in some areas and it shouldn't.The graphics shouldn't warrant a higher end card. It looks a bit cartoony and kind of looks like the Unreal engine  from doom 3, a little more polished but not much. Graphics should be better. It is fun to play. seemed like an old school game but i welcome those games. Wouldn't pay more than $15. I bought it for $4 and some change. Oh yeah! this game download did not want to work. I tried everything and nothing. it installed perfectly, got a menu , but as soon as I launched, i got a Blue screen of death. I had to download the game from a different site and that copy worked flawlessly. BEWARE! this is a STEAM game. I had to get a another copy that wasn't steam in order to play it on my computer. there are no patches for this game as I write this. And yes, I do have a steam account.<br /><br />AMD FX 8120 overclocked to 3.6ghz  32C - under game load<br /><br />XFX Radeon HD 5770.<br /><br />8 Gigs of 1600 RAM
468	0	If you want to save money just get the year membership because this product is making u pay like 7 bucks for a month wich sucks compared to the year membership.
469	-1	"This wasn't a bad game, and I can see how a lot of people would really enjoy it, I was just looking for something mentally stimulating. There was only one mini puzzle. Mostly it was just finding the items on the list. Once in a while you got to make things like martinis or put all the bottles in the scene on a platter but then there was spending points on objects that fill a library that you dont do anything with.     Although, it being based on \\""The Great Gatsby\\"" should have warned me, I am still a bit disapointed in the lack of excitement in this game."
470	1	I have been playing The Sims since the very first generation- Have always loved. I have yet to buy Sims 4 since I have heard so much negative about the game and bugs. I love Sims 3. I am still having fun gettin expansions for it. This was the first time Ihave ordered a direct download game from Amazon and I am not disappointed. It installed easily, no issues, and is a lot of fun to play. Thanks, EA and Maxis!
471	0	I have a very stable Windows XP machine. The game produces some weird errors.     (1) If I run out of time on a level, it will ask me if I want to give up a life in exchange for advancing to the next level, and then crash.    (2) When I exited out of full-screen mode, the cursor disappeared and I can't get the program back into functional full-screen mode.    When the game is up and running, it is a lot of fun. The graphics on the jewels are colorful and the background music is really fun.     If you like Bejeweled you will enjoy this one.
472	1	This game got too much of my time, it was that good.
473	1	"Being a huge fan of the Crysis series on pc, I was eagerly anticipating part 3. Unfortunately, as a whole, it feels more like an extended dlc pack for Crysis 2 than another game in the series. The new bow is a blast to use with all the different types of arrows but makes taking any area with it a cakewalk regardless of game difficulty. You also gain the ability to use Ceph/alien weaponry with only a couple of them having a good, powerful feeling to them.<br /><br />The Story: Although many have griped about the story in this one, I feel it's the strongest in the series mainly because of your partner, Psycho. His wrestling with the fact that he's no longer got his nano suit and the psychological trauma he faced in its removal creates a deeper layer than any in the Crysis series. The one thing that could have set this game on fire is if it were a global stage and not just New York...again. Some of the levels are excellent in their design while others seem empty and boring.<br /><br />Graphics: This series has been a benchmark for pc graphics for years now and visually doesn't disappoint provided you have a pc that can run it maxed out. I upgraded to a 2gb gddr5 gtx 680 with an i7 processor and 16 gb's of ram and with all settings on the highest, it runs super smooth. Prior to that I was running all medium settings and even on that the game still looks really good.<br />The one thing that was a let down in this department for me was that there were no \\""WOW\\""! moments visually that Crysis 1 and 2 had. Like seeing the sunrise for the first time in Crysis or seeing Central park being uprooted and lifted into the sky in Crysis 2. Outside of a dam collapse and looking down on the earth, there's really nothing in 3 that is a breath taker. Also, some of the death animations of Cell soldiers are on the slightly choppy side.<br /><br />Audio: Solid throughout with decent voice acting all around and some really nice musical cues although I felt some of the alien weapons lacked the sonic punch they deserved.<br /><br />Gameplay: If you're a fan, then not much will be new here save for a few new customizing features of your suit and attributes and a hacking ability which is really just like a rhythm game that allows you to use enemy turrets unlock special weapons crates and manipulate certain ceph aliens. The biggest fail in terms of gameplay is a dune buggy style vehicle that you get to drive. It really feels tacked on with clunky controls all around and thankfully it's not a consistent thing you have to do for the majority of the game. The after credits scene clearly hints at another Crysis game, possibly in the vain of another Crysis: Warhead with you taking control of Psycho again.<br /><br />Crysis 3 is a good game and I would recommend it, just not at full price. Luckily, it's on sale somewhere nearly every week so it's worth it especially if you're a Crysis completest."
474	1	pretty good game play, way better than a lot of other bowling games.
475	1	No need to go out and buy one, with just one click you got a psn code and ready to play.
476	-1	Amazing bundle. Would love to have it.......spending 20 minutes on error screens followed by suddenly it going unavailable is not cool. How about Amazon actually figure out how many they have to work with before hand instead of forcing people to spam refresh and pray they get one?
477	-1	its great and all but it sucks because i paid for the rights but can only use it on one computer and i did this so i didnt have to worry abiout the cd i could just down load it from my acount but they dont let you im very up set and would suggest not buying it
478	0	Since they sold it as an MMORPG there needs to be A LOT MORE content and they need better matchmaking. There is no interaction with other players unless you are in a Fireteam or in the chat channel with a headset. How can they call it an MMORPG if there is only 1 or 2 raids  and the second is with an expansion that costs $30 - The game is only out for 2 months or so there should have been more content by default.<br /><br />They also need to implement matchmaking of some sort for Raids and Heroic Strikes, if you don't have a Clan or a bunch of friends playing with you, there is no way to get into a Raid, Nightfall or Heroic Strike
479	-1	The game mechanics are decent... Somewhere between arcade and sim.  The trouble is, this game has been abandoned by Atari / Eden.  The DLC content is only available by purchasing Atari tokens which are no longer available, so many of the cars are not available.  Bikes were supposedly added, but I can not get the bike pack to download and there is no tech support available.  The supporting forum and website were halfway renovated then abandoned, leaving a jumble of html code and broken links.  Online play is buggy.  This could have been a great game if it wasn't forgotten during Atari's restructuring.
480	-1	We have the correct OS etc. but this game just won't load. Get an instant error message, no matter the configurations. Waste of time and money! Buyer beware - no help from tech support of game either. :(
481	1	bueno
482	1	"This is a great deal on a starter pack for new and current players of Need for Speed World... where else can you get 5750 speedboost and 2 \\""good\\"" cars for $14.95???"
483	1	I am not gonna write an essay about how drm sucks. Well people deal with it. Almost 95% of pc games are pirated so you have to combat it. But otherwise I will say that if you are going to have always online then you can't mess it up. You have to be prepared. Loses one star for horrible start but quickly redeems itself when you get into the depths of this game.
484	1	Everything top notch...<br />Thanks Amazon
485	0	fast moving, but predictable
486	0	this is okay.
487	-1	The game is too old for download on any new computers with Win 7.  It just fouls up my computer and I have to repair my computer.  When I tried to get help from your tech., he just tried to make me a liar by telling my I couldn't have downloaded it on a trial basis because he would have seen it.  My suggestion is that you stop selling downloads that are too old or you know little about.
488	1	I think what late night has to offer is great if you want to play the celebrity life in the new town. If you don't think playing a celebrity is what you would enjoy, the extra household items and outfits alone are worth the money you would spend to purchase this expansion.
489	1	Great game. It kept me into the game the whole time. I really love games that you WANT to finish because you are having so much fun. I usually dont review games but I figured this is a hidden gem as it wasn't over hyped like the other *cough* shooters.
490	0	When installed to Windows 7 64-bit, it crashes after starting the program. And later I figured out it is because of my 3D vision was on.  What made me happy was it also prompt there's an update, however it immediately turned into sadness since it won't install. Even if I ran the program in Administrator role or turned on compatibility to Windows XP mode, the update patch simply didn't install.  Anyway, I can still play without the update if I turned off my 3D vision option.
491	0	Like MANY people online, Windows Live creates a major headache with this game (am on my second install). Steam will validate is one way, and then Windows Live will update it so it won't run.<br /><br />You must set up an offline Windows Live account to be headache free.<br /><br />Otherwise, visually beautiful game.
492	-1	Sounds like a good game, but two downloads failed, would not open, got error message. I had no problem with 2 previous Amazon games, so it's not the downloader or my system. No one else reported this, though, so it might just be me in some way. If it happens to you.....you are not the only one....
493	0	The content, thus far, has been severely lacking, but it's a necessary evil. I'm not going to knock a company for milking the product as much as they can, especially considering the expansion has just added more time and opportunity for further exploits in that world. Bottom line : If you don't get the expansion, you kind of do get left behind, but you're left with JUST enough nuggets of equipment to keep you coming back. There should definitely be more than one RAID for this expansion.
494	-1	Good thing i had a no-cost promotion code for this.<br />After the acquisition process completed, and i got a msg that this was in my inventory, i loaded the game.<br />There was nothing new in the inventory of any of my characters.<br /><br />I was annoyed for a short time, but this made me realise how very little i cared about this at all.
495	-1	I found this game addictive but also frustrating.  The concept of the game is challenging.  The programming and gliches are frustrating.  I purchased this game and had problems from the first.  I kept getting a pop-up screen that said I needed to change my resolutions.  I checked everywhere I could think of to find a place where my resolutions did not conform and even had a computer geek/guru check my settings.  Settings were ok; the game did not believe it.  This box popped up during play and intercepted and slowed down play.  The game was very unstable too and would sometimes crash.  Mostly the pop-up is what prompted me to take my losses and uninstall the program.  Never thought to ask for a refund.  Next time I will.
496	-1	THIS PRODUCT MIGHT BE GOOD, BUT AMAZON IS AWFUL!!!<br /><br />I purchased this product thinking I would be able to put it in my Origin client and just start downloading and hopefully play by the time I get back from my workout, but instead I shelled out $120 for a useless bit of text!<br /><br />If you want to save yourself sometime, buy it from origin.<br /><br />Amazon will just tell you to contact EA and take it up with them, I've never had worse customer service in my life!<br /><br />As of writing this, I cannot get my item refunded, or get a working code.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!
497	0	The game responds slightly slower than the console versions and there is occasional frame rate drops, even on my high end pc.
498	1	I bought this for my son who loves to play Xbox live.  It was a great purchase.  You can buy the same 12 month card elsewhere but at Amazon it was much cheaper and never have to leave home.  The information was emailed almost instantly,my son entered and started playing within minutes.
499	-1	I don't recommend this game for anybody that's using a laptop.<br />This game does work a little for me in windows 8. After I purchased a new HDD for my laptop.
500	0	I got to a point where I was going to need to buy a steering wheel rig for my computer to advance any further in game.  Thats when I stopped playing, otherwise it may of gotten more stars.  Neat concept, playing a driving game with other people, rather than against just the computer.
501	0	"I just cannot start the game. On my Windows 7 Dell laptop w/Sandy Bridge, the games starts, and when it looks like it's going to run.. it closes on its own. Then, I get \\""Failed to start game app already running\\"" error message. On Windows XP desktop, I just get \\""Failed to start game. unknown error\\"".<br /><br />I googled and tried many different remedies, and none of them are working.<br /><br />Verifying integrity,<br />installing \Steam\steamapps\common\Pacific Skies\_CommonRedist\OpenAL or vcredist,<br />unchecking Enable steam community in-game option, etc.<br /><br />Same thing goes for both Ace Patrol and Ace Patrol Pacific Skies.<br /><br />There are many open discussions on steam communities for the same error. And 2K games seem to be aware of the error since September, but failed to provide the remedy. Although I like Borderlands, this is not very good customer service.<br /><br />-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br /><br />Update: I have another desktop with i7 and discrete AMD graphics card. On this PC, both games ran without any problems. I am still disappointed by the fact it doesn't run on my laptop w/Intel graphics. This is a strategy game with less than 150MB in size from a reputable developer / publisher. I didn't have this kind of problem from many indie titles I own.<br /><br />-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br /><br />Update2: I got it working on my Windows 7 laptop with Intel graphics.  Please, read the comments.  This may / may not work for your situation.  I added one star and now my review is 3 stars out of 5."
502	1	Just what i need, i received an email with the code in seconds after my payment was done<br /><br />And there is not tax, recommended
503	-1	"Can't even install the bloody game. I'm having a lot of fun reading this install error over and over again though  \\""CRC error: The file D:\ANNO 2070\maindata\Data2.rda doesn't match the file in the setup's .cab file. The medium from which you are running the setup may be corrupted; contact your software vendor.\\""<br /><br />Nothing at all worthwhile from Ubisoft (shocker). Lovely. Wish I hadn't bought it from Amazon so A) I could take the discs back or something and B) I could get my money back when this doesn't work out."
504	1	i bought this twice, once for me and another for a friend we love Day Z!<br />easy to install.<br />i would recommend this game for people that like zombies.
505	0	I have Chessmaster 10th edition and an old copy of Fritz 7. Fritz 13 is far superior. It's my go to chess program! My only complaint is that if you are on line and don't touch the program for a while your computer will be usurped by another user to analyze their positions!? This is probably part of the Let's Check function of the program. This is almost unbelievable since there is no way to turn this off. In fact, the only way I have found to turn this off is by turning off my internet connection. Granted, my game appears to be automatically saved but why should someone else use my resources (electric, CPU etc..) to analyze their games, especially when I was using them? Just for this alone, I had to go from 5 stars to 3. And it makes me wonder, what else is the program doing without my permission??
506	0	Stop making people use Origin just to play it offline.
507	0	It's best basketball game for PC. But choices aren't plenty and developers know it. It's a poor improvement from last year, it looks almost the same as NBA2K9, and just changed the rosters and a little bit AI.
508	0	I downloaded this game a month ago and spent hours of enjoyment; but no matter how many players reach 9,999,99 it will never unlock the guest house paints and stuff. Another player froze at only 10000 = points.  Like others who have posted there are glitches where you cannot place objects where they belong. A wonderful game when they work the glitches out and unlock the updates at certain amounts/points.
509	-1	No offline playability - I hope this isn't the route that all games will go eventually as I'm not sure my internet is fast enough to handle it.
510	-1	I can't even play the game because Origin won't allow me to activate the game. I don't understand how EA can make such a buggy and unstable program and then force you to use it!! And because of this, I'm NEVER buying an EA published game again!
511	-1	eh, can't really do much with this demo. I have since bought the actual game and it defiantly wasn't worth the $60 I spent for it. its more like a $20 game. huge disappointment for a long time sim fan. I expected more. plus the game constantly crashes.
512	1	Fast and easy..Excellent!
513	0	When I first tried to download this game I was getting confused, but I finally figured it out. Follow all the instructions exactly and have the Sims 3 launcher open while you do it. I had to hit the download button several times for it to work but at last it did. (Another user's review had useful instructions-look for the one who gave a higher rating than the rest) Hidden springs is nothing too amazing, the landscape is pretty similar to others in sims 3, the Gypsy House is very cute though. I really like the Italian theme of Monte Vista- beautiful landscape with new houses and the Veronaville street name from sims 2. The brick fire oven is my favorite new item.. and there are a couple of nice dresses added. I would purchase again, but could do without the annoying download procedure!
514	-1	I'm really surprised that this was released by the same people who did Borderlands.  This game is horrid!  I'm not really all that disappointed in the graphics (they aren't the greatest but aren't horrid) but the &#34;plot&#34; (in quotes because I'm still not entirely convinced that it is a plot) is boring and the bugs.. wow, the bugs.  I was just playing along and got killed.. by nothing!  There's no alien around anywhere just me and that idiot AI guy who couldn't agro a mouse.  I also can switch weapons when using a controller, it gets stuck between the sidearm and the grenade.<br /><br />There is a possibility that in a month or two after some of these bugs have been fixed this may be a somewhat playable game but even after that from the people I've talked to that have finished it (real people, not what I've read online) it's only about a 6 hour game.  Hardly worth the premium price that they made us pay for it.<br /><br />In short, I would wait to see if any of the bugs get patched and pick it up in in a month or two when Steam's got it for the 20 bones it should have been priced at.
515	-1	didnt work
516	1	Much better to get code online than picking up in store. Use this if you play a lot online games with Xbox and if you want to get full use of Netflix, Hulu and other apps
517	-1	Won't work under XP. Wouldn't install. Stated it would work but the ID_10_T socket would not open and thus could invoke the installer to start
518	0	The graphics is nothing more and the type of game does not really my type. It's basically an action game in first person with the difference that you have to interact much with the scene, collecting and activating things.
519	-1	I bought the game after viewing the videos and things on youtube. First off, this game takes at least 8 hours to download. Once downloaded, you get to install it. Everything seemed fine until a message box popped up saying a file was not in the spot where it is supposed to be. Seeing that, I tried looking for the file, no luck. Then I tried re-installation three times, got the same results. I had no choice but to re-download the game, and this did not help either.<br /><br />I am a computer nerd with a vast amount of knowledge on computers and how they operate. I was trying to play this game on my new HP pavilion laptop, the specs are far above the minimum requirements for the game.<br /><br />This game is apparently a BETA. Not knowing that before I bought it, I guess I got what was coming. Betas are supposed to be free because they do no work half the time. This game never worked in the first place and I bought it. Don't make my mistake
520	-1	I bought this on impulse from steam and regret my rash action. The game starts<br />slowly and tapers off so I don't believe I will finish this game as it is just too tedious.<br />The pros:<br />Hmm<br />The Cons:<br />mediocre visuals<br />endless and needless, cut scenes<br />voice acting that makes you cringe<br />horrible interface that cannot be remapped<br />a clunky combat system<br />a ranged weapon you cannot aim, it automatically aims at the nearest enemy<br />There were a few good reviews on steam but I believe they were from the<br />developers.
521	0	The game is ok, it just doesnt have the adventure that the other Luxors. But if you just want simple with no added frills or thrills then this your game. Overall the game is ok, but since I like PC games like this, then this suites me just fine.
522	-1	"So we have several issues:<br /><br />This game was to be it.<br /><br />SimCity. The game to end all SimCity's before it. The poster child of the Sim (Maxis) franchise. That's a lot to go up against when making a new game. I'd expect every fan to come out of the wood work and buy it on release day. So for a game like this to be truly successful when asking $60, it has to be ready for prime time! I want detail! I want customization! I want to be able to play the game I purchased!<br /><br />So let me tell you how it happened if you bought the game as a digital download at 1PM EST on release day. In case you were wondering, that's how I did it.<br /><br />Well, you'd pay, then you'd be told to go to Origin and download the game. But the game isn't there. You reboot. still nothing. You wait an hour. Still nothing. 2-3 hours later, you can download the game! You can barely get a couple hundred KB/s on your top of the line connection. You finally get into the game. You try to figure out the game. You crash. Ugh. You try again, it makes you play the tutorial this time. It didn't the first, weird... but this time I'm forced into it. You complete it. You are excited to create your own city. You start! You begin to really get into the game, when it crashes! You reload and find your city 10 minutes before the crash. Ugh! This kind of stuff continued to bother you until you try it in the middle of the night in hopes it's calmed down. Well it's down alright. Completely. But you don't know because your launcher is indefinitely stuck on \\""Checking your Game Updates\\"" or whatever.<br /><br />Sorry, got carried away, but that's pretty much how you would have experienced it. Because most of the Pre-Order customers and Launch day purchasers ended up in some kind of scenario like this. A couple days later, it seems to be working a little better. That brings us to our other issues.<br /><br />Join games is horrible. It is difficult to browse for games to join as you are only shown about4-5 new regions at a time, and most of them are full! There are no options to not show full games or show more at once. Ugh.<br /><br />So you create your own region, not caring whether you play with others or not at this point. You just want to play. But hold on, my city can't be bigger than 2 square miles or so? Are you kidding. Within 1-2 hours of building your city, you find yourself very limited by your boundaries, and forced to focus on micromanaging density improvement and getting as much stuff crammed into a tiny area as possible. Isn't this Sim City? What fully functional city is this small? Well they exist, but most of us don't consider 20k to 80k populations giant cities. If you try REALLY hard, you may get above 100k. I've hear reports of 200k being about the theoretical max.<br /><br />So what else? There are some cool options, design cues, the simulation system, the graphs, the customizable utilities and things. But you know what? Overall, this game feels dated. I'm sorry, but while there are improvements, this game does not feel like the city simulator for 2013. In fact, Cities XL was honestly a far better attempt overall. It's downfall was only being single threaded, so large cities are CPU hungry monsters that leave your Hex core processor only using 1 core while it limits your gameplay. SimCity does not have that issue. It at least uses 2 cores. So why can't I go bigger? Individual people are not that detailed looking, follow very rigid lines in game, and can't take that much power apiece. This would have been more impressive in 2006-07.<br /><br />And the multpilayer aspect that your forced into is almost non-existent. Other than the fact you may happen to be near other cities in your region. The interaction with them is minimal. You send each other resources in a very nonchalant.<br /><br />I have been a simulation buff for almost 2 decades. Ever since the first Sim games I played; Sim City 2000, Transport Tycoon, Sim Tower, Capitalism 2, etc.,I've been hooked. It is immense fun creating your own Business/Empire/City, or whatever. Especially when you have detailed control to make it truly yours. Just why I love the 4x genre as well.<br /><br />But SimCity falls short. I really hope the get the server issues fixed, then focus on patching this game! Maybe with some tweaks, enlargement, and more detail, it can be great. But right now, I feel it will get old fast for most!"
523	1	pros<br />-free games, from AAA blockbusters to little indies<br />-free games in droves<br />-Did I mention free games?<br /><br />cons<br />-Too many games to play<br />-Already full gaming backlog bursting at the seams<br />-Needing a larger HDD for the consoles and a larger memory card for the Vita<br /><br />Sony just did everything right with plus.
524	-1	I haven't even been able to play it, I contacted legacy games but the fixes they told me to do haven't worked.
525	1	Fine!
526	0	For the money you spend, it's pretty good play but for me, the game became unstable at the 20th level.  Game play became erratic.
527	-1	I found a manual on the web that describes just about everything, but it doesn't cover the basics, like how to build buildings.  For example, I finally discovered that double clicking the transport would cause the building to go up (it wasn't in the instructions), but only after searching and searching for a location on the map that would accept it.  No guidelines for finding the right spot.  In only the second mission, it said to build two mines.  I finally found a location for one mine,and then I spent a frustrating hour taking the second mine vehicle over every inch of the map, without regard for protection, but I could not install it.  The manual says there are only some places that will accept mines, but it doesn't clarify beyond that. There was no way to complete this very basic mission.  If there had been enemy around, I would have been toast!  I then used my own troops to waste that vehicle, and then I uninstalled the whole thing!  I'm glad that it wasn't expensive.<br />Another example, I tried to save the game in order to make another attempt.  Each time I entered a name and clicked on Save, it erased the name.  Finally, I found that entering a name and hitting the Enter key would save it.  Whoopee!  So now I can return and face the same frustrations! No thank you.<br />I saw some walkthroughs on the net that showed good, intense, and complex missions, but I know that I will never reach that level if I can't even build structures!<br /><br />Ya get watcha pay for!
528	0	You have to answer questions to enter the game that are supposed to filter out young people. Too bad at age 25 I fail the quiz more than half the time and am bored of the game by the time I get in. Other than that it's very similar to the game I remember my grandpa playing long ago.
529	1	good
530	-1	Sadly uses Games For Windows Live and the multiplayer is quite buggy. Many dropped games and connection issues. A real shame since the gameplay is decent.
531	1	Amazing game. Good environment and plot. Memorable characters. Everything you could expect from Final Fantasy and in my opinion, way better than other MMO's.
532	0	Worth a try.  Seems ok for a few days then got boring.<br />It if fun however so if you can get it for<br />10-15 why not try it.
533	-1	Some of this dislike is my fault. I thought I was buying a play off my computer game. Turns out this game is based out of STEAM CLOUD. I must be logged on to their system to play. Very sad, I just didn't go to Walmart and buy it there.<br />I have played all the Civ games, from the early 90's on. Love the game. hate the must play online part.
534	1	Great online card, i could buy metal gear peace walker for ps3, and yet have some credits to buy another games.
535	1	The perfect way to while away the hours. I often jump in the car , turn on my iPod a cruise. The only problem is the cost and wear and tear on my car. No more, now I just jump into my Volvo and head to Europe. I could not be happier with Euro Truck 2.
536	0	I'll go around all the EA hate, which I do hate and talk mainly about the game. This isn't really Sim City like we're used to playing. They pretty much streamlined everything to make it really easy. But by doing this, you're forced to build a bunch of cities to feed into your other cities via resources.<br /><br />The constantly online stuff becomes a hindrance when you just want to play alone. I also think the constantly online aspect forced them to remove terra-forming. Some of the places are just wrecked so bad, you can't really build a town properly. I feel like the patch will have to add stuff just to make some of the maps playable.
537	1	Worked perfectly on my Plus Suscription. I paid it with a gift card i received on xmas
538	0	i still havent figured out how to download it the file isn't showing up. i bet it will be fun once it works
539	-1	I have purchased on line games before and this is the first time I cannot get it to load.  I am very unhappy and I do not like losing money this way
540	-1	wiil not open or run .none of the instructions are useful m m mn m m m m m m
541	-1	I purchased upgrade. Code did not work. Curse tech support will not respond to tickets that I have submitted for help, other than to say the issue is fixed. Never fixed. Curse employees are not helpful. If you purchase this upgrade do not expect help if you fun into any issues.
542	0	I used to play the hell out of this game.  Its a lot of fun to run down memory road but it crashes my computer.
543	1	Awsome
544	1	one of the best games I have played.<br /><br />Plan to replay it every few years, great characters and story.
545	1	Perfect I can't complain this is just what I need it. Just in time for bioshock infinte and other free games
546	-1	I always pay close attention to customer reviews. Except the one above. This game won't start.
547	1	Great game.  I played DS1 and DS2 to completion and now DS3.  DS3 felt bigger.  Admittedly less scary but still very good.  I must confess a dislike for the &quot;unkillable&quot; monsters.  And not real fond of the giant crab monsters who are nearly unkillable.  But everything else was VERY well done.  No need for coffee while playing.<br />BTW, the original PC DVD would not read on my PC....had to use the product code to get and activate a download version.<br /><br />RH, Calif<br />Jan14
548	0	I bought this game for my grandkids to play. They played it for about 10 minutes and stopped because it was too easy,
549	0	SimCity - Standard Edition REVIEW<br /><br />-Pros-<br />Fun game play!<br />Intuitive design and re playability!<br /><br />-Cons-<br />Always online DRM support which means you have to have an internet connection always to play the game.
550	1	This is somewhere between a (free) mod and a full (paid) game, and it's not the worst FPS/RTS combo I've played. Hopefully the developers will keep adding content for years to come.
551	1	love this game! easy interaction. fun for all~ It's fast fun but as you get deeper into the game it gets harder to keep up
552	-1	Downloaded the game the day it came out. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY A SINGLE MINUTE TO DATE.<br /><br />Waste of money to this point
553	1	Excellent game for the whole family.  There's no additional requirement as far as DRM goes (ie. Steam, Origin) and the game looks beautiful on any screen.
554	0	I remember seeing a game similar to this called Crayon. Great for opening a child's imagination. Something most kids today are sorely lacking.
555	-1	The game itself would be great fun, if it would actually work
556	-1	This game needs some work to make it more entertaining.
557	0	I have 30Mbps download speed- its not the best, but I can play my online games with ease, with this connection. First you have to make an account with &#34;Origin&#34;, its EA's gaming portal (similar to Valve). make your account with &#34;Origin&#34; then you input your game codes. after you register your game, then you can download them, and holy jesus, standby for the longest download of your life. hopefully the game is worth it! just a horrible download speed to report so far.
558	-1	I thought it was strange that I needed to install a downloader to get a 'free' game, so I created a restore point on my computer first. First thing I noticed is that the Amazon Downloader stays resident in your computer even when you reboot. I downloaded the 'Amazon Downloader' and then downloaded Cake Mania. I also 'downloaded' another free game using the Amazon Downloader. Using Windows Explorer I copied the downloaded game setup files to a totally seperate and private folder where I have other personal files in my computer. Then I manually exited the Amazon Downloader program (it even warned me that by doing so I would not be able to download any more games until I run it again or reboot). Then I went to Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel and 'completely' removed Amazon Downloader. Then I restored my system settings using System Restore. Lo and behold, not only were the downloaded games missing from the Amazon folder in My Documents, but the 'Amazon Downloader' kept track of the files I copied into a seperate private folder, and it DELETED those files from my personal file folder before uninstalling. I WOULD NOT TRUST THIS AMAZON DOWNLOADER OR ANY OTHER RESIDENT PROGRAM THAT CLAIMS TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. YOU WILL ALWAYS PAY. THEY HAVE BECOME CONfidence ARTISTS AND FOOLED YOU INTO INSTALLING AN INTRUSIVE PROGRAM INTO YOUR COMPUTER. I am disappointed since Amazon had gained my trust as a customer for years but now I wonder what they have done with my personal information and history. Shame on Amazon.
559	0	I love spore but there is not patch for windows 8. It keeps crashing and will not stay open for more then give or ten minutes at a time.
560	1	Good open world game with great graphics and storyline.  This is not a Dead Island redo.
561	0	This was the worst installation experience i have ever had.<br />Not only do you have to go through steam but steam gives you a code to go through another third party registering service.
562	-1	I bought the game for my boyfriend and was very let down to find out that I can not open the game on my kindle .
563	0	"After the success that was \\""Hotel Dash: Suite Success,\\"" is anyone really surprised that Playfirst decided to come out with a \\""Hotel Dash 2\\""?<br /><br />Me neither.<br /><br />The premise behind HD2 is that the French Fry Convention is coming to Diner Town, but only if Flo, Quinn, and Mr. Big can upgrade 5 dumpy motels into luxury resorts in time.<br /><br />Sounds cute right? It is...BUT...it's almost EXACTLY the same as the original HD. There are a few cute new features, like a vine or zipline that Flo uses to zip from the top floor of the hotel to the lobby, saving you some elevator time, and some new faces for the guests (\\""Big Foot Hunters\\"" who are the same as the sleep walkers from HDSS. They kind of remind me of Chubacka. And the \\""Old Sailor\\"" who is essentially the same as the Hungry men). There's also a fun feature that lets you put together a map, which is surprisingly a lot more challenging than you would think at first glance.<br /><br />A few gripes:<br /><br />The guest needs are EXACTLY the same as in HDSS. You can anticipate the business ladies needing towels and the hungry men needing food. It's exceptionally predictable and therefore sucks some of the fun out of this promising sequel. You would think the Playfirst folks would have had a little foresight to mix it up a tad.<br /><br />The graphics in HD2 are also shockingly bad. The story parts are not even animated like in Cooking Dash 3, and the room doors and layout in general are tiny. It's not hard to see what you're doing, it's just a huge change from HDSS. You get used to it, but it's kind of a rude surprise if you're coming off a HDSS high.<br /><br />Also in the first hotel, the \\""bug mariachi band\\"" sound in the lobby is EXTREMELY shrill! My dog actually stood up and started barking when she heard it for the first time. Headphone users be warned, I jumped out of my skin and had to wrench my hands up to tear the headphones off my ears the first time I heard this sound for fear of going quite deaf.<br /><br />Despite its faults, HD2 is fun...I guess I just expected more change from the last one. Somehow HD is not near as addicting as Diner Dash for some reason. I can't put my finger on it, but the fact that there is not a lot of difference between HDSS and HD2 is somehow not as forgivable as a new installment of Diner Dash.<br /><br />Bottom line: HD2 is a fun game, but if you're expecting epic change from HDSS, you're in for a disappointment.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars.expected more change from the last one. Somehow HD is not near as addicting as Diner Dash for some reason.

564	0	Wow, what happened to the Dragon Age i fell in love with?<br /><br />THIS IS NOT THAT GAME! gone is the slower more intimate battle system, gone is the expansive world of ferelden, gone (for the most part) are likable companions (save for your elf chick) In place of the things we loved about dragon age 1, is a quick gorier battle system, a singular city in which everything happens with essentially the same 4 quests with different people asking for them (using the same sights and locations within the city ie using the same dungeon for different missions) and essentially 4 homosexual companions that hit on you from the very beginning of the game. I am looking at you Anders, and Elf Man that nobody seems to like. Dragon Age 2 tries too hard to be pushy and edgy on the companion love interest aspect instead of being something that builds up long term as in DA1. the story is decent enough, but nowhere as good as DA1. The game does have it's moments, but they are few and far between. Play the game so you are ready for DA3 is my recommendation. HOWEVER WAIT UNTIL THIS IS ON CLEARANCE CLEARANCE CLEARANCE SALE! this is not worth your 30 or even 15 bucks.<br /><br />4 stars for graphics<br />3 stars for story<br />2 stars for originality ie same damn locations for everything and never leaving the city (except for a 45 minute expedition into the deep roads)<br />5 stars for voice work<br />1 star for likeable companions<br />3 stars overall.<br /><br />This is Ghost Writer, hoping this helped you in deciding whether or not the game is worth purchasing.
565	1	This is a great bundle... the game itself is gorgeous to look at, challenging but fun to play and worth every penny.  The Amazon price was by far the best I found even after checking three or four other sites.  You can't go wrong with this!!
566	1	This is a great deal for those don't have any of these games: Metro 2033, Red Faction or Darksiders. By this price you can have funny for all year along
567	-1	I wish I didn't buy this game and I advice everyone not to buy it. Unless you really don't care about the story line at all but, I doubt that there are people who would buy this game for any other reason beside the story.<br /><br />-Missions system is the worst.<br /><br />-It feels like the game was targeting 9 years old customers or the game's company is actually thinking that their fans are just stupid or the writer isn't very bright OR the writer have something against logic (half way through the game I got pissed and just picked random answers when I talk to NPCs).<br /><br />-Ending is HORRIBLE (no matter what history you have since Mass Effect 1, it almost doesn't matter, the ending was like a slap to the face followed by a spit).<br /><br />-A lot of the gameplay time is spent running around (the missions system makes you do that. Which makes me think that they did a horrible mission system management on purpose so you just run around on foot or on the ship to waste gameplay time that does not cost them anything).<br /><br />-None of what they have advertise about the game is true.<br /><br />-Multiplayer have LOTS of upgrades and unlocks that can be earned by playing OR CAN BE PURCHASE WITH REAL MONEY.............!!!??<br /><br />After Battlefield 3 let down, now this. I swear to god this will be the last game I buy from EA even if it was the last company to make games out there.
568	-1	Had I known that I would have to download through Origins, I would have bought from a different site. Origins, at least for a Mac, requires a different processor than the game itself. Meaning, even though I BOUGHT my game that was able to be used on my processor, Origins won't let me DOWNLOAD it to be able to PLAY it. Makes sense? It makes more sense to be able to download directly from Amazon rather than go to another website that has different requirements. Never going to buy any game from amazon if it has be to downloaded from Origins again. And if I were able to return the game itself, I would. Sadly, I can not.
569	1	The best option for me to buy microsoft points! they last less than seconds to send  one simple code. And from just about seconds i got my game bought on my xbox !!!! This is great! y prefer this rather to wait which is useless for me, mentoning that I'm living out of US ... Would perfect if they just upload 400 and 800 mp codes!!
570	0	This is bizarre. I have played it several times and still look for what is it trying to accomplish.. I'll keep trying...Perhaps the graphice on my computer are not up to the game (?). But, I paid for it and I will use it.
571	0	Decent game but very outdated.  ITs a shame that more is not being done to make it more of a joy and less of a time sink
572	0	The Multiplayer does not work everytime I try and connect it freezes up at the start up screen and I half to ctrl, alt, delete and log off cause it freezes everything!  This is very tiring I've googled everything to try and fix it.
573	0	I enjoy city planning simulations.  I've been playing them since the 1990's.  This program is very realistic and lots of fun.  My only real complaint is the fact that the game crashes regularly when the city reaches about 150,000 inhabitants.  I also have a Core i7 Dell with 8 gigs of RAM and an NVidia Graphics card with 2 gigs of RAM.  This program just eats everything my computer owns hardware-wise and runs the battery down in 1 hour or less.  I wonder how people with a more moderate system fare.  I still prefer my old Sim City over this.
574	-1	Don't waste your money or time on these games.  They are terrible.  Bad graphics, misspelled words, you name it.  I just threw $13 in the trash.
575	0	psn told me it wouldn't upgrade, but after i had contacted support the option seemed to be unlocked. so i purchased it on ps4 and it worked fine.  dunno, i would suggest trying to contact live chat and bug them if you bought this. i got it to work, but rating it 3/5 because the game kinda sucks, and the fact that they are screwing people over with this non upgrade crap.  good luck!
576	-1	Love the game... hate the lag.<br />I didn't research this game before spending $20... Everybody has issues
577	0	Game play is a bit slow and the failure rate is high.  Expect to try many times before making much progress.
578	1	I am new to Simcity and purchased it after the off line mode arrived a week or so ago.  So far it has been wonderful and I have had none of the glitches getting frozen out or unable to save that other people have described.  I have not played the multi-player version yet, but the single player off line mode has been a ton of fun.  A great take on the old SimCity.  I have it in Medium settings running an an AMD A8 and it runs very well.  It is a very addictive game and this version allows you to create specialized cities with specialized economies that focus on oil or coal or tourism or industry. Regions play a bigger role and add for a new dimension when your city hits a maturity and can't expand further.  The graphics are not as great as I had hoped for though.  Maybe my memory has faded but it doesn't seem, graphics wise, to be a huge improvement over SimCity 4.
579	-1	Just a horrible game. Uninstalled not long after purchase and could not get a refund.<br />Way too confusing controls and lags really bad. Not fun at all
580	0	Xbox is a rip off, Microsoft cripples your machine and makes you pay to un-cripple it. Greedy extortionist practice.
581	1	A+++
582	0	My son wanted this game SO BAD OMG MOM I NEED TO GET THIS FOR MY BIRTHDAY PLEASE PLEASE!! I got it cheaper on Amazon than on steam (and still, the code was redeemable on steam) he's played it maybe a total of 8 hrs. He has more time on Gary's Mod & Minecraft. It's a cute game though, and really helps with spelling skills.
583	0	I have to say that Build a lot is a fun game that i can play over and over again. I was really excited to see this game and once i downloaded it, i had to play it. I will say that this Power Source game was very easy to pick up and thought it would be harder than the previous build a lot games. I have yet to complete build a lot 3, but this game was easy to beat and had no issues with it. Only got stummped a few of the challanges, but once i tried again, i solved them. I hope build a lot continues to make these games and I love playing them. The adding of the recreation function was a nice add on.
584	-1	The new 4GB patch helped the visuals a bit and the AI is a little better. But the game is still very dull and lacks any tension or suspense. You walk through short nearly identical corridors shooting random aliens that pop out and sometimes attack you, sometimes attack an invulnerable NPC, and sometimes run from you or hide behind things. When they hide you can just walk up to them and shoot them. They won't even notice you're there. After a bit you'll come to a door that an NPC needs to fiddle with to get open. So you stand on a platform while aliens attack from all sides and you shoot them. Sometimes an off-screen alien will be hitting you and other than your life bar going down there's no indication anything bad is happening--no sound or video effects. So you have to constantly check your peripherals on these platforms. These missions are boring. Circle strafe and hold down the left mouse button, push v if they aliens get close. Then run through door. Hilariously one of the missions required that all the aliens be killed before the NPCs would continue through the door (and let you progress). I ran through the door too soon and 6 aliens endlessly attacked an NPC while I stood and watched. He shot off in the distance hitting nothing. They stacked on top of each other and smacked him a bunch. He took no damage. Neither did they. So I casually walked up to the most dangerous creature in the galaxy and watched a bit. Eventually I got bored and fired a couple of shotgun blasts into the mighty stack of aliens and they all died and me and the NPCs went through the door together.<br /><br />Although the graphics are improved they are still not very good. Lighting and shadow effects do not look quite right. They added a hazy blurry filter over everything. I suspect that the purpose of this filter is to hide the low res textures. My suspicions became stronger when I came to an area that had marines trapped in the aliens nest. As I got closer to the marines the blur went away and I noticed the marines looked like a texture from a game from 2002 or so.<br /><br />The worst part of the game is that it just isn't fun. I'd forgive the silly AI, 2002 era graphics, fuzzy filters, and everything else if it was fun. Or tense and exciting. But it's just a dull walk through some hallways. Duckhunt had more atmosphere.
585	-1	1. OK graphics   2. I dont like the tutorial  3. The reaching levels concept actually makes it boring
586	1	This way to get point when I need to use it. No shipment and downloads.<br />I like this way to get points.
587	-1	The launch of this game has been a major disappointment. Like what seems to be the majority of customers, I have yet to be able to actually play the game. Working in IT, I understand that things sometimes go wrong. Catastrophically wrong, even. But what really irks me about this situation is that is has been forced upon us.<br /><br />The Sim City games have, since 1989, been single-player games, and their fans have loved it. With this reboot, EA decided to add some degree of multiplayer interaction. No one asked for it, but sure, what's the harm? Except it wasn't added as an alternative game mode or optional feature; it was a mandatory burden forced upon those who wish to simply play alone like in the good old days. This really caught me off guard as a wild departure from the franchise's history.<br /><br />So now, we find ourselves unable to play the game we paid for because a service no one asked for isn't available. I have no doubt that the availability issues will eventually be cleared up, but this experience has soured the game for me, and does not bode well for the experience which awaits when I get to actually play the game. It seems that this game was produced with little no consideration of what made its predecessors successful, and that's just really disappointing.
588	0	Medal of honor 2010 was EA's response to Call of Duty after Battlefield Bad Company 2 launched. Even thou, Both are made by DICE, they feel different which is good and bad in the way I'll try to explain. The game ditches a few good things that set Bad company 2 apart, in order to be more like Call of Duty. Environment is not as destructible, recoil is almost non existing, killing streaks give you mortar strikes and other things to use, just like call of duty. It tries to focus so much in the MP area that makes a good-but-short SP section. Don't get me wrong, I understand people feeling rip-off if they paid $60 for such a short campaign (it took me 5h without any rush on my end) but after paying $5 for it, I'd say the game is pretty much worth that price. Campaign focus on several characters switching to tell the same story just as Call of duty does.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />+ Works great in Nvidia Surround without the need of external tweaks.<br />+ Same engine as Bad Company 2<br />+ Great content if you pay $5-$7.5 bucks.<br />+ Campaign story start slow and gets interesting towards the end.<br />+ Hardcore mode available (at least) in MP<br />+ Better than certain versions of Call of Duty<br />+ MP is very active with many servers<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Campaign is short. Characters are forgettable just as Far Cry 1<br />- Engine was modified for worse. Destruction is smaller than BC2, and riding an ATV sucks. Recoil is not existing or too little in order to appeal to a wider audience<br />- Maps feel like Call of duty, but doesnt add anything new to the table<br />- AI supplies unlimited Ammo to you in SP<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />If you get it during a sale for a cheap price, and if you like: Cinematic war fare games like Call of Duty or Bad Company 2 you will enjoy the short but above average campaign and you will be able to play a few hours of MP games to get your money back. If you paid over $15, Then I understand your thoughts as the content of this game doesnt justify that much money unless you get hooked on the MP right away.
589	-1	I don't understand what all the fuss is about it's EA, what did we expect?! They should have got the message with Spore, perhaps this time they can read between the lines!
590	1	This is fun and I really enjoyed it.  I think the first one was better but this was good.  Good graphics and I love shooting the bad guys who pop up.  I never bother with the storylines so I can't review that.
591	1	Lots of fun facts about whology and the cybermen.  A great story and Matt Smith is just as funny and fun to deal with as ever.
592	0	I played through to Expert mode in compatiblity mode Windows XP 2, but for some reason 3 levels into Expert Mode the game will not play in full screen (I tried all suggested fixes still small) now the boards are so small it's annoying to play.
593	0	The game was fun but not really scary. There were too many nude men. I guess penises are supposed to be scary. When I play a game that says Nudity and Strong Sexual Content I expect to see at least one nude female even a clothed female would have been a plus. When you get to the Female Ward don't get your hopes up because there are more nude men in there too. The only women in the game are talked about in notes and documents. I probably will not play this game a second time or the DLC. Games that go out of their way to exclude women are not for me.
594	-1	"I know the game says \\""windows 2000/xp\\"", but I honestly thought windows 8 would be able to \\""run this game as xp (service pack 3)\\"" like it has with KOTOR I and II and GTA Vice City and San Andreas, but no.  The first gate issue is present.  Even the one time I made it past the gate, inventory didn't work and the game crashes anyway... If you have Windows 8, 7, or Vista, DO NOT GET THIS GAME (until Rockstar makes a patch).  I've tried other solutions online but nothing has helped yet... If anybody knows of any please let me know"
595	1	Love that I was able to get this with my Amazon credit. Instant delivery. PS+ is better than Xbox Live Gold since you at least get free games.
596	-1	Screens are very dark, some are very hard to see. It is an old game, is not really for windows 8 or 8.1, or even for 7.
597	-1	"Stay away...and I mean stay FAR away from anything with EA Origin (the steam rip off program that this uses). It is a mess. The PC version of this is poorly optimized and you will spend more time trying to find a lag free game on their \\""dedicated\\"" servers, then you will actually playing the game. This is a great game if you get into a good game, you will have more luck with that on 360 or ps3. Stick with those versions."
598	0	This game was just okay. I enjoyed the first House of 1000 Doors much better it was far more challenging.
599	-1	1/5 Too much water - IGN
600	0	After a headache of trying to get your promote code to work i was very upset. Look into it because a lot are invaild.
601	0	Had a really rough start at launch and it's not worth the monthly subscription in my opinion. Decent game otherwise.
602	0	Just a few extra story lines, worth it when on sale.
603	0	It's alright
604	0	I like to play interactive games, so this game was alittle boring to me. Although I feel the game is perfect for the younger game players. Ages 8-12 would love going through the different levels of scare tactics. Your able to pick your ghost and rooms to use different scare tactics to send all dorms quest running away in order to take over the level.
605	-1	Perhaps Hercules used steroids, because this game did not age well.  What was a favorite of mine as a kid quickly became a disappointment.  Hercules tries to offer some interesting game mechanics in its gameplay - the three plane battlefield, for instance - but fails in execution in comparison to the more polished games of today.  The stale combat, unresponsive controls, and repetitive level designs can also make the game a bore, which is somewhat of an accomplishment given that you can beat this in less than an hour.  So, although this game isn't even six dollars, save your money or spend it on a title that further deserves your hard-earned cash.
606	1	Definitely worth the $10'ish I paid for the download version from Amazon. I've only  finished the main game and a couple short expansions, currently working the longer one.
607	-1	Would've been nice if I could play my game when I got it. Heed the other reviews and don't buy this.
608	-1	Got burned buying this crap game. Should have read reviews and gamer forums before wasting my money. ubisoft has abandoned support for FC3 and the community it suckered.
609	-1	The concept is interesting, but the controls are uncomfortable to say the least. my movement controls and my ability controls aren't anywhere near each other so whenever I want to do anything other than move i have to move my entire hand to a different spot on the keyboard. The mouse doesn't really help, since it's sensitivity is insanely high. when aiming with throwing knives I have to use millimeter precision to make sure I get the throwing knife to fly onto the desired side of the screen. Not even the desired object, the desired half of my screen. The combat is also a major problem. Unless you are assassinating someone, you have to stand the exact (x) amount of pixels away from the enemy or else your sword will fly right through them without doing any damage. Same goes with blocking (by the way the blocking control is incredibly uncomfortable as you have to move your whole hand to block). I have gotten to a point in the game when I just want to have a nice assassins creed brawl, and I can't do it because of the above described issues, I only deal damage once in every 20-30 hits. Graphics are nice though, not the best, but they appeal to me and I enjoy just watching my assassin run left and right, cause that's about the only thing she can do without bugging, while the background and graphics swirl prettily around her.
610	1	If you shop around you will find this is a very good deal. However, we did have some difficulty with the code. When we entered it the first time, it said the code had already been used. That was a little upsetting. We tried a couple more times, and I was about ready to call customer service when the service just started working. Despite setup problems, my X-Boxer is happy.
611	-1	this game is absolutely terrible.  You are 100% dependent on your team to even be able to win, and being a free game you get absolutely terrible teams 90% of the time.  I highly suggest you download it for free and play until tier 5+ without spending a dime and that's about when you will get fed up with the game.  You will be even more angry if you already bought gold or premium tanks because you really get no benefit.  The price for enough gold to last a month is easily the price for 1-2 console or PC games. When you do get tier 8-10 most of the time you actually have to pay credits even if you win the battles because they are so expensive to fix and the ammo is ridiculously expensive, so again you have to resort to buying credits/gold/experience with real money.  If you want to expand your garage to more than a few tanks, or put camouflage, customize in any way at all you have to spend gold which you cannot earn in the game.  It gets very expensive and just isn't worth the time or money.  By far the worst part though is that you cannot choose not to play with certain people and WOT does not punish bad behavior, which means you may have a team mate that decides he wants to kill you and other team mates which happens very often. You will also have team mates that decide to suicide into the other team because they have no reason not to.  You will have teams that sit at base and do nothing for 15 minute battles and if you try to you die in half a second because its a team based game.  This &#34;expert pack&#34;  will basically get you about 25 bullets for a medium tier tank and some camouflage, along with some garage slots.
612	-1	Good Luck getting the battlelog to work.  I don't understand how every &#34;quick match&#34; ends with could not connect to server.  Even more annoying the load outs for each class are done online.  Go in game and watch as the load outs for the classes you just made are missing or incomplete.<br /><br />The graphics in this game are great and the vehicle combat is superb.  However this game has been out long enough that this massive bugs should have been fixed a long time ago.  As it stands I would not recommend this game to anyone who is looking to play a game<br /><br />If I could return this game I would.
613	1	The graphics on this game are amazing! The kiddos love playing the seek and find games and the mini games with in it are pretty great too!
614	-1	This worked very temporarily on my MacBook Pro.  Installed, uninstalled, reinstalled; nothing solves the problem.  Can't recommend it at all -- waste of money.
615	1	working as advertised
616	-1	this game will not install properly from ANY site i have tried-had to get a refund from amazon for it-which they readily gave-leaves behind technical issues from download-leave it alone-risky
617	1	Only a good deal when the price hits 40 bucks. Otherwise wait.
618	-1	At first this game has promising preposition but the game is sluggish. Once it picks up a bit when confronting the alien it only becomes infuriating with the constant &#34;it catches you, you die, try again&#34;.
619	1	you get the code instantly after purchase, it doesn't get any better than that! unless spiderman comes and knocks at your door that is.
620	-1	Very deceptive. In the description, it says &#34;Co-op Design - Borderlands is built from the ground up to be an exciting, intuitive cooperative experience for up to four players simultaneously that rewards players who work together and invest in co-op skills. Split screen is also supported.&#34;<br /><br />I was assuming this meant for all platforms. I bought this game purposely to play with someone on my pc. It only allows single player on pc. Found out the hard way. This sucks. Wasted my money for nothing.
621	-1	Couldn't get into it. Wish it had a free trial. That's what I get for buying an early release. Maybe it'll be worth it in a couple years.
622	1	one of the best shoot and loot games on the market.  What is better then shooting people in the head or sending a mech out to do the dirty work?  Nothing!<br /><br />The only grip I have is the broken drop rates
623	-1	Was misinformed about the game.  Expected 5 games as listed.  Got 3 games that were correct but Sacra Terra: Kiss of Death was Sacra Terra: Angelic Night and Eternal Journey: New Atlantis was Atlantis: Mystery of Ancient Inventors which did not even load on to my computer. Do not purchase this game. You  will not get what you are paying for.
624	1	Not much more I can say that the other reviewers haven't already said. Simply put, this is the best baseball management game out there! You can do as much or as little as you want, from managing each game from the dugout, to figuring out who to promote from your rookie level affiliate to your AA team to fill in for that injured prospect.<br />Ever wanted to create your own fictional world with your own teams and players? This game is for you. I used to play with modern MLB rosters, but soon found my calling when I set up a fictional league based in the US with only 10 teams. I was able to use custom logos, home and away uniforms for my players, and stadiums for my teams.(There is a plethora of user made content on the OOTP forums that can be downloaded and put directly into your game!)<br />You can watch in amazement as your fictional league comes to life and you will find your league will seem less and less fictional as you play.<br /><br />The team at OOTP developments work tirelessly to make this game as customizable as possible to allow every user to play it the way they want to. The $40 you pay for this game is returned back to you in only your first few hours of playing thanks to the level of immersion it provides.<br /><br />It is a must buy for any sports management fan!
625	1	fun fun fun.
626	0	I bought it thinking I would recieve Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho. They are not included in the season pass. Sad the day.
627	1	Couple of things to note. make sure you are buying the correct platform. One reviewer said they were downloading onto two apple computers.....this is the windows version.<br /><br />Also, chances are you already have the curse client. When you buy it, you can either download the client or just click &#34;Only need product keys?&#34; It redirects you to a order summary with a product code hidden under a button. Ctrl-c, Ctrl-v onto your curse client premium subscription page under coupon, click claim. Done and done. The only possible reason to not give this 5 stars is because you are not following the instructions.<br /><br />To avoid any and all confusion, log into curse, download the client form them. Open the curse premium page. Buy product code from amazon. Insert product code. Your client will auto update server side.
628	1	"Did a little research, but not fast enough.  Visited Best Buy to see how it measured up.  This piece of art won awards in 2009 for its in-depth portrayal of tactics and strategy, all while keeping the game fun!  This is a rare one...if you see it at a reduced cost like $12.50 as I did over the holiday break, snag it!  You'll be happy you did.  If not, the going rate of $49.99 is worth every penny.  I didn't order in time due to other financial responsibilities toward the end of the month and it jumped back up to $49.99 from $12.50.  I cussed like a sailor for five minutes and my wife thought I broke a toe or something...she said something about \\""little boys and the price of their toys.\\""  If you still need further convincing, Google \\""ArmA II demos\\"" - the two games that comprise this package deal both offer unique demos to demonstrate the games' firepower...and that ain't a pun.  Semper Fi!"
629	0	Its the launch and the demand is much higher than I think they anticipated. I don't know if I'm giving them more credit than they deserve. When I get a game going its great and I have a great time.<br /><br />I have though, played the game without the idea that I will ever play with the same city twice. I will lose the city and I will get kicked off the server at any random point but its still a fun game when I get the chance to play it. Its so good that I can tolerate these early growing pains.<br /><br />As for anybody looking to buy it I'd say wait, wait until they get this all worked out hopefully they will price cut it or refund some of the money back for this whole debacle but I don't think they will.
630	0	"I played the demo of this game. It was very cute so I wanted to buy the full version. The full version got really boring and stupid, you have to do exactly the right thing, otherwise your villagers starve to death. Also, you have to micromanage them, otherwise they stand around in the middle of their village \\""worrying about food\\"". However it takes eight hours for them to get even vaguely food self-sufficient."
631	0	"I remember when I first played the game in 2005/2006, when it appeared somewhere on Tv. I don't remember correctly anymore. Back then, I played this game a lot and really liked it. I stopped playing it around december 2006, cause of personal problems. Now, I've found the game again, through the \\""Steam Greenlight\\"". I've decided to buy the game and played it. I was amazed. The menu, the server list, everything was new. It also had Shadows & Shader support. I've also discovered, that Terrains & Interiors had been deleted. Because of the activity of the community, I won't take this into review.<br /><br />So, here are the Pro's of the game:<br />- You can write your own Add-ons, in an easy-to-learn scripting language called: TorqueScript.<br />- The game features Shadows and Shaders, which makes the game experience even better than before. Also, it's not hard to find the settings and editing them, like it's the case in many other games.<br />- It costs for lifetime just 20$, which is a really good deal, everyone would pay for. While other games are offering expensive prices for their games, which aren't even lifetime, Blockland just offers a little amount of money for lifetime membership.<br />- It's a really safe game. Since Badspot decided to compile the game scripts, the game is absolutley safe against hacking/exploiting attacks.<br />- You have complete control over your server, allowing you to do what you want on your server.<br />- A Trust system. This system prevents people, that are griefing your buildings. You can give \\""Build Trust\\"" to your friends or others, so they can just build on your bricks, but not delete anything. To people, you highly trust, you can give \\""Full Trust\\"", allowing the person, who've got Full Treust, to completly configure the bricks from you.<br />- Blockland has been build like that, it doesn't harm your computer. For example, when the server lags, most games harm the computers CPU. This isn't the case in Blockland. When the server lags,the game stops, and a yellow \\""Lag\\"" Sign appears on the upper right side on the Blockland window, until the server reacts again with another ping.<br />- The characters in Blockland are well-made, making them also moddable for hats, shirts, etc.<br />- Blockland isn't only compatible to Windows users. It also works on Mac's and can be used through Wine also on a Linux OS.<br /><br />This was a short summary of Pro's of this game. I'm really amazed how good it became over the years.<br /><br />Here the Con's of the game:<br />- The community, yes the community, is not one of the socialest and friendliest people at all. However, if you're trying to be \\""one of them\\"", you may gain some respect. But if you think, you could just step in and think those people are serious at all, you're wrong. Many jokes by them have been taking too seriously, causing a lot of arguments. So, but sometimes a lot of them are overreacting or doing too much of these jokes, making it impossible to difference \\""Reality\\"" and \\""Illusion\\"" (Between Serious and Unserious). Through this, many people are pretending to be someone and try to steal your key/form account. So, you should look out for this, before doing something.<br />- Blockland's Shader & Shadows feature isn't supported on all Chipsets, unfortunatley. This is a huge negative reputation, which could be prevented, of course if Badspot fixes this problem.<br />- The control over servers. It's a good thing, but also a bad thing. It's possible, that people, which are aged 7-9, will confront with inappropriate stuff. This makes also Blockland for people, which are atleast 14 or older.<br /><br />This was mainly everything to say about Blockland. I give it one star for the open-world possibility, ability to script own add-ons. The second star is for the Shadows & Shaders update and the third star is for Mac, Linux compatbility and for the nice workaround to things, that Blockland harm your computer in any way. If Badspot can solve these cons or atleast prevent one of them, this game would get another one star from me. Why it doesn't has 5 stars is very easy to answer: Blockland is actually just another LEGO building game. This isn't an offense, not in any way, but it's true. There have been in the last years a lot of LEGO games, which makes Blockland pretty uninteressting, cause of the reason I've said a secound ago. This isn't a Con in this case, because changing this, would actually completly destroy the behavior of Blockland and it's community, making it completly useless. So, I think the review is done now as it is."
632	0	This game is good graphically, yet portrays surgery OK. There is the basic cutting and closing, but no pinching off bleeding vessels or CPR. No X-Rays, CT scans, or anything else pre-op or post-op. Just the surgery. The big thing with me is that most of what you are supposed to do is already portrayed visually, and you just do the function. For example, when they tell you to spray an area with disinfectant, the area is already turned orange and you just aimlessly move the bottle around to fill the task bar, instead of the area turning orange as you go. Same with incisions and parts of the operation. And there are only 7 or 8 surgeries to choose from.
633	1	A really good remake of a classic game.  The graphics look really good, controls are easy to learn, and it has cast members from the Ducktales show, which is a great addition to this game.  The game isn't insanely hard, but it sure does have a good amount of challenge in it's platforming.  While the story isn't anything too special, it does have some funny moments in it.  If there is one thing I'll say about this game, it's that it is not best played on a keyboard, so I recommend anybody to use a 360 controller or a PS3 controller with MotioninJoy, whichever option is more accessible.  Even though I never played the NES game, was born around the early 90s, I was a fan of the show, and this game feels like a love letter to Ducktales, whether it be the show or the game.  100% recommended!
634	-1	Have this on the Wii, so was expecting the same fun. Couldn't get through one level before nothing worked.  Full of bugs, so don't bother
635	0	While I like the new CAS for Sims 4. It isn't enough to make me want to buy the game. That being said, I love the way the characters look.  I like the wide variety of voice tones offered.  I like that hats are separate from hair and that pants automatically know if they should be inside or outside the shoes. If the game just had toddlers I could overlook everything else that is missing and would give it a go.
636	1	Apparently there aren't any reviews here but all over the internet there are middle of the road type of reviews.  So here is mine real simple...its not diablo III and its not 60 bucks for a reason.  Its a fun 15 dollar game that reminds me a lot of a few old school &#34;dungeon crawler&#34; type games.  There isn't a mini map (not a big deal imo) and its only local co op.  I bought this game for my husband and I to play when we just wanted to run through something and kill stuff.  And that is exactly what we got.  If you except to play a 15 dollar game and plan on comparing it to a game with a much higher budget then don't buy this game.  If you want an old school game that is pretty fun to play and you don't want to go broke paying for it get this game. (oh and the complaints about spiders...really? kill the egg nests and no more spiders)
637	-1	The 20gb download is going to take about a day to download at 250kB/second, then there may be patching, etc.  I googled it, and others are having similar problems.  I have a decent internet connection, it is on their end so I suggest buying the disk IF you really want it.  To add insult to injury, the $15/month subscription is counting down as this downloads slowly.  Forget the &#34;imperial horse&#34;, we want decent download speeds Bethesda, 1 star for your efforts considering how much you are charging.
638	-1	"I got it for the ps4 and ps+ has been total s*** on ps4. Microsoft and sony have found a good middle-ground for their \\""premium\\"" services that pretty much screws everyone equal. Ps+ started out so good. But they've become cheap and that doesn't warrant a smiley face or a pat on the back"
639	-1	I've been trying to play this game since I've purchased it and haven't been able to get it to work for longer than 10 minutes. I literally have to save the game obsessively due to insanely frequent crashes. Even after the game update, the game still crashes ALL THE TIME and I mean ALL THE TIME!!! I've clocked it and I usually get about 8 minutes of running time prior to a crash. It's worth the extra wait to just order the game through the mail. At least that way it will work!
640	-1	Purchased for my son as a reward for getting on the honor roll, and he was so disappointed.  His excitement turned to frustration after the game constantly froze and had to be restarted.  He has a new computer with plenty of memory and is super fast, but in spite of all that the game was useless.  I had to buy him the Xbox version, so I literally bought this twice.
641	-1	Doesnt provide steam code makes you download through amazons horrible service
642	-1	Boring, repetitive, too easy, boring, repetitive, boring . It never changed, did not progress over levels and you end up with the same easy gameplay you started with.
643	0	It's OK.  Not your typical hidden object game.  This one is more repititious.  Each time you exit, you literally exit not leave off.  Every time you enter the game, you begin at the very beginning instead of where you left off.  The hidden object scenes are fine, the puzzles are really awful.
644	-1	The controls make this Vita game a bad port of a very nice game I loved on PC many years ago.  It is hard to get your creature to 'flow' in the right direction.  I missed so many objects I was aiming for simply because the creature would not move in the direction I was pointing.  There is a sense of speed in the PC version that just is not evident in this Vita version due to the wonky controls.<br /><br />Final verdict: Don't bother playing this even if it's free.  Just play the old Flash-powered version.
645	1	Very great. Meets all my expectations. I really liked the new story and other extras. I play a lot in coop mode and thanks to this season pass I added hours of entertainment.
646	1	Very fun
647	-1	After downloading Origin, all three games refuse to download. Have send multiple emails to EA asking for assistance to no avail. I can't tell you anything about how good the game itself actually is, but the online game code for this is apparently worthless.
648	0	weird game... not really into it.
649	-1	I have been unable to load the executable file necessary to start the game onto my desktop computer, which I use to play my action games. Although I was able to load the game onto my laptop, that is not sufficient, because I cannot attach the joysticks to it.
650	0	I like it but when you should get to the next level there doesnt seem to be one.After you rent all the rooms and click on all the silver keys, you just keep clicking on silver keys. Is there something I am missing??<br /><br />  Carolyn C. Donathan
651	0	Got bored of it too quick. I say wait for sale when it goes under 10 dollars. Not really worth 20 dollars.
652	1	This is and will forever be my favorite childhood game. I adore all rpg freeplay games. Rockstar seems to always have the best ones.
653	0	A mediocre game. Not really worth it, and runs poorly on most graphics cards. Basically, you talk to a guy then run thru a bunch of zombies to do a fetch quest for him. Repeat 300 times.
654	-1	The window that this game appears in will ONLY allow 2 sizes, full screen and some ridiculous large(although less than full screen) screen.  So if you want to say, watch a movie while you play a game of solitaire, you CAN'T split the screen evenly because THIS program does not allow for size adjustment as mentioned above.  Stay away from this program.  Ya think maybe that would be an important fact to know BEFORE you purchase??  Again, stay clear of this program and possibly all the programs/games created by pozirk games?!?!?!?!
655	0	Borderlands 1 and 2 are my favorite games. At first sight, this does seems like a good deal.<br />However, the Borderlands 2 is just the standard edition. Which doesn't include any DLCs.<br /><br />According to the price on Steam, if you want to purchase all the DLCs for Borderlands 2, it will cost you $142.58.<br />Think about it, The price of GOTY for 1 and 2 are $22.99 and $59.96 on Amazon, which includes all the DLCs except the 2nd level cap increase for Borderlands 2 ($4.99). Which sums up to $87.95.<br /><br />So, if you don't need the dlcs, go for it. (But do know that the 4 story dlcs for 2 is awsome)
656	0	Not near at as good as the regular Big Kahuna, but fun for a little while. Need Big Kahuna 4!
657	0	meh, entertaining for a little while
658	-1	does not work. installed it the same way i have always done it with the other several amazon downloads and nothing. furious.
659	-1	The worst support game team I have ever known. Because of deceit and trickery based on the developers and their company. charging people full price for a series of convoluted games which should of only been one price for this whole series.
660	1	Best purchase I've made in a long time! I spent some time looking for the Stronghold games at a good price, and this is by far the best deal I found. All four games are great, and there has been no problems starting or playing any of them what so ever.
661	0	Great game. Has a few issues here and there however square-enix customer support needs a HUUGE revamp. I've been banned from the game for an entire week because if their lack of competence. The gold sellers are a huge problem compromising tons of accounts including mine (and no I don't visit shady sites and/or buy gold from anyone and neither did I have malware in my PC) . They need to step up their game or people are not going to pay subscription fees for terrible service.
662	-1	spent 2 hours downloading from the amazon website....installed and then had to wait another 2 hours to download it again through steam...I didn't want a steam game and it shouldn't have downloaded from amazon if it was one.
663	-1	Flush your money down the toilet instead, atleast your toilet doesn't have to connect to the Internet. Seriously terrible, 60 dollars and the game won't even start... What a joke
664	-1	When the game opens, it goes into full screen mode which is too big for my screen. I see a quarter of what is shown on the screen.<br /> I have no way of minimizing the game so I can play it. I have NOT been able to play a single game!
665	0	I like the story line and the progress through the game. I do not like that it is very hard to controle with the mouse and the keyboard. Not the best game for PC. I'm just sorry i spent $50.00 on thiw game.
666	0	The game is great, awesome graphics, sound, you know the stuff an awesome game has. My problem arises with origin and battlelog however. To play campaign(single player, no internet connection needed) you actually need to press play from origin, which will then launch the battlelog site, where you then have to click play. So basically, you need to be online to start playing campaign. So, if you're on a laptop with no internet connection, you can't play campaign. Battlelog also gives me an error online whenever I press 'quick match' from their site, so the only way to play multiplayer is by manually selecting servers.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />As of a few days ago Origin updated and allowed for offline play by selecting 'go offline' from within origin. Rating increased by one star. Also, it does come with a 'multiplayer head start' kit,  labelled 'welcome pack' in the Origin addons. I didn't decrease any stars for that(I thought I didn't get a head start kit) so no increase here. The fact still remains that there is no in-game way to select servers and the game must be launched for each individual server you join, thanks to battlelog.
667	1	Great, fast and safe way to get money on your psn wallet.
668	0	some quick sections almost impossible.
669	1	Only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because it was a pain to get Max Payne 3 to launch on steam. I had to reinstall some file twice before it would start working took me 2 days of research and a lot of try this and restart computer. Finally got it to work, both great games.
670	1	[[VIDEOID:3c55a267a94d624fe977d39e0ff5fc36]] A bunch of cars, a ball, and two goals.  It's a recipe for chaos and it's also Rocket League.  It's a multiplayer arcade style soccer game that is a surprising hit among gamers.  It's a pretty simple game, so let's take a quick look at Rocket League in this game review.<br /><br />You compete in a stadium with up to 4 on 4 teams where you try to push a ball in to the opposing goal.  Cars have a lot of maneuverability with powersliding for control, boosting for catching up speed, jumping to reach the ball and even dodge rolling.  You use all of these moves to take control of the ball and score when you get the right chance.  There's small boost pads around the map which give you a 10% boost and then a big boost ball to max out your speed.<br /><br />There's a tutorial mode, but it's not even really necessary to run.  The game is designed to be a pick up and play fun multiplayer battle and that's exactly what it is.  It doesn't take very long to learn the controls and start bashing with other cars online.  There's also couch co-op with up to four players if you want to play locally.<br /><br />There's also an in depth season mode that's fully customizable for the single player experience.  You can setup your team with your own logo, style, and name.  Then take them into a long multi week season.<br /><br />Unlike most multiplayer games these days, there are no perks and no stat changes.  All cars and all players are evenly matched.  There are tons of unlockables, but they're all cosmetic.  The dev's intention was to keep the game balanced and this was a smart choice because the game would be way too chaotic with an excessive amount of power ups.<br /><br />Rocket League runs on Unreal Engine 3 and it really shows the diversity of the engine.  The graphics are very attractive with detailed stadiums.  Each stadium has it's own unique location and sometimes even a different time of day which keeps the variety up.  The various glow and boost effects from movement add a nice highlight to the gameplay.  The best part of the atmosphere is probably the boost sounds.  It's very thrilling to max out your speed.<br /><br />The devs spent a lot of time on the physics engine of both the cars and the ball to make the handling very accurate.  Once you learn to combine boosting, powersliding, and jumping you can gain a lot of control over your vehicle.  Sometimes it gets a little chaotic with all players constantly bashing the ball and it can be a bit difficult to take your shot the way you want it.  But that's kind of the point of the game.<br /><br />Rocket League is on Steam for $20 and it's a console exclusive to the PS4 at the same price.  It's actually cross platform between PC and PS4 which is great for increasing the player base and giving you an opportunity to play with friends on another platform.  PS Plus members can actually pick up the game for free right now, so there's no harm in trying it.  I can recommend you check the game out if you want to blow off some steam with friends online.  It's not the most amazing game and I'm not sure how much longevity the multiplayer will have, but it's definitely good for fun in small doses.

PS Plus members can actually pick up the game for free right now, so there's no harm in trying it.  I can recommend you check the game out if you want to blow off some steam with friends online.  It's not the most amazing game and I'm not sure how much longevity the multiplayer will have, but it's definitely good for fun in small doses.

672	0	"Age of Empires was a once successful franchise that began its downfall shortly after reaching its zenith in the AOE II series. The gameplay was beautifully constructed, the 2-dimensional battles of monumental proportions made one excited to hop on and fight against the computer, or better yet, actual opponents. Today still, people deal with modern-pc incompatibilities in order to experience this game play.<br /><br />Age of Empires III takes you forward in time to the colonial period, involving lots of rifles and Native American settlements. You also receive by default (in skirmishes) hero characters with special abilities. Scattered across the maps are ruins that one can harvest for in-game perks. One is now able to gain experience, which allows you to call for supplies from your home country as you \\""gain levels\\"".<br /><br />I am quite honestly disappointed in the game play. It feels too pandering, even on difficult settings.<br /><br />* You now only need three resources. Stone has been dropped from the game; instead you search for silver mines which harvest your gold (???). You are also able to build plantations, which provide you an unlimited source of money that can be harvested by 10 settlers for only a few hundred wood. Seriously? Why bother searching for any mines then?<br />* Food is now basically unlimited as well. While in AOE II you were forced to grow crops, you now just have mills that yes, ten settlers can indefinitely harvest food. You can see here now, that all you need to do is have your settlers start out chopping wood like mad (with a few harvesting food to make more villagers) and once you get your mill and plantation up in the third age, you're home free.<br />* Villagers no longer need to return supplies back to certain buildings. This means you can send someone across the map to chop wood, and it will immediately begin to trickle into your inventory. The same goes with the rest of the resources- no longer can you surprise your enemy's resource camps and kill them before they can return with their goods. Everything is automatically deposited.<br />* There are now 'cards' and 'experience' you can use. By doing pretty much anything in the game, you gain experience, which in turn allows you to send supplies and resources from your motherland. Need outposts? Even a fortress? Sure thing! Leveling up your home city also lets you unlock decorations to make it look prettier. It does not actually affect game play, so I consider this a horrible waste of time.<br />* Building limitations. You're limited to very few buildings in the skirmish mode, some of which you only get one. I say, if you have the resources, go ahead and build whatever you want! (On this note, fortresses also will train ANY unit you want, not only specials. I didn't like this feature either).<br />* Resource trade depots. Now on the maps, there are trade routes (that build from a simple cart up to a railroad, which looks buggy as hell when it reaches the end of the line and freezes before spontaneously disappearing) that if you claim one of the spots with your explorer hero, you are able to claim tribute each time someone passes by. This can be in experience, or any resource you want. As time passes the tribute increases. Soon you will be able to receive several hundred (to even a thousand) units of tribute from just one pass, if you're able to hold the depots. (Which isn't hard when playing against AI, they take their time getting to the depots, and ignore yours once you've built it).<br />* Native American Settlements. There are now settlements that you can 'claim' by building another trade depot. Doing this allows you to build additional warrior units from their tribes that does not affect your own personal population limits. They train quickly and cheaply, so if you're quick to grab these areas, you can easily raise 20+ ridiculously strong units in a very short amount of time.<br />*Science is easy. It shouldn't be. I'm able to upgrade the majority of my research by the time I'm nearing the end of my Third Age. I have accumulated so many resources that it's just a moment's work to sift through available research opportunities, and I'm able to research everything within a few minutes. This shouldn't happen so easily, should it?<br /><br />The list goes on, but after several skirmishes on varied land, these changes from AOE II frustrate me. The game is now just too simple, too easy. Games that would normally last me a happy 5-6 hours now finish within 2-3. It's watered down, and even if I don't bother with using boosts from the home countries, I feel like there's no point.<br /><br />On top of this, you still have some problems dealing with running the game on Windows 7/8 platforms. As a digital download that's even available on Steam, I feel as though Microsoft should have focused less on decorative banners and more on the compatibility of a game /DESIGNED BY THEIR OWN COMPANY FOR THEIR OWN OPERATING SYSTEM/.<br /><br />But there are some good things about this game as well.<br /><br />- The music in battle is great. They didn't spare much expense for this (instead of the warning trumpet in the last few games), and when you go into combat, a harrowing orchestra spins up from the depths of your computer's sound card, drawing you towards battle, as short as it is. You also hear the distant booms of cannons in the distance, signaling artillery attacks. These are nice additions to otherwise placid game play.<br />- The graphics are definitely an improvement. Buildings slowly take visible damage and have animated collapses. The three dimensional figures look great. (Though I would still enjoy AOE II's two dimensional figures if the game play had been up to par).<br />- You can actually download the game online! Very few of the AOE games are available for download, which is why I had to get AOE III to get my RTS fix... fixed. AOE II also takes forever to configure LAN/online games and requires lots of third party intervention, so I figured I might as well snag AOE III, because it couldn't be that bad compared to AOE Online, right? I wasn't wrong, but I wasn't very far from being wrong anyways.<br />- Bulk training. You can now train in groups of 5 military units. This means if you're in a rut and are being attacked, you are able to pump out five units to come out of your building at once rather than just one to face any enemies in the surrounding areas. This is one of the few changes in game play that I appreciate.<br /><br />TL;DR - If you've never experienced AOE/AOEII game play, you should still be able to enjoy this game quite well. If you're hoping that AOE III will build upon the experience of the beautiful, medieval feel of AOE II, please don't expect much. The game play when compared is truly a let down, and for many people, you will find it just too simple and too placid.<br />For a scant amount of money that I paid for this game, it was worth a shot, as I love the AOE series the best. But I doubt I will play this game much longer, before returning back to AOE II. I feel too guided in the game, too limited and pandered. I'm not a child who is experiencing their first RTS.

673	-1	This game is more like WoW than Skyrim. Cancelled my subscription on day 3. Servers are still lagging.<br /><br />Update 8-14-2016<br />I bought this game AGAIN but this time for Xbox one. I got a little further and actually succeeded in playing for almost 7 hours without being bumped off the North American server... AND IM PLAYING FROM EUROPE!<br /><br />Well today I gave The Elder Scrolls Online​ a second chance. Remember Skyrim? I was level 81.5 (the maximum) and had mastered every type of play. It was always fun, always kept me engaged, and had few boring moments. ESO takes SOOOO LONG to get anything done. there is no clear tutorial or explanation about how to do simple things like crafting or learn your fighting buttons. This is NOT an Elder Scrolls game, its a Warcraft game by Bethesda Soft.<br /><br />This game is dark. and I don't mean gritty or gory. I mean its pitch black in some interior spaces. Even with a 5 bar connection to the North American server the controls are lagging. Almost all of the items I picked up in the first few missions were worth ZERO at the vendors. Combat is lame. Push Buttons, swing sword. Power attack = Counter opening. Lame. All of the cool stuff costs &#34;crowns&#34; like any game nowadays with tons of dlc add ons. Bethesda has sold out and lets hope Fallout 4 is the comeback.<br /><br />What makes me mad the most is the lack of transferable account. When I upgraded from Xbox 360 to Xbox One I received COD Ghosts season pass FOR FREE ($42 value). When I logged into ESO with my old account from the launch PC version, I GOT NOTHING. I didnt get back my Imperial edition. Is it so hard for Bethesda to transfer this information over? Its not like Xbox and Microsoft's Games for Windows are from different companies.<br /><br />This is getting traded in tomorrow. Feel free to comment but nobody is changing my mind.
674	-1	didnt work for me
675	-1	Just nothing like the original, and the voice acting is so mind-bogglingly, blood-boilingly cheesy and unlikable that I couldn't even get through more than 3/4 of the game. Ugh..
676	0	This game is pretty fun and provides a lot of re-playability, one of the better low cost games I have played.
677	1	Simply one of the very best I've ever played. It loaded easily on Windows 7 with 6 megs of ram, and I played it at 1600 X 1200 resolution so the graphics were stunning they were so good.<br />Music was good, story was fine and action was nicely paced. I even liked the cut-a-way videos and the puzzles were brilliant as well. They were not so difficult you have to cheat to solve them, but graphically were the best I've ever seen and I had fun solving them. I liked both 1000 door games so well, I'm going to buy the 3-D version also now because the first two were big hits for me. I loved it and would recommend it to most people.If you can play it on the highest resolution it's a real graphics treat I think.<br />Wonderful game!!
678	-1	It runs incredibly slow. Unable to play it. Had to add extra RAM to the computer just to get it to load.  Awfully disappointed.
679	0	It was fine. Received digital code instantly and had no problems using code on PS Store.
680	0	A classic, but the graphics absolutely suck. Last time I buy 5+ year old games.
681	0	i can't get the code so far is not accepting my payment
682	0	This game could be a five star game if only the makers took a bit more care in the product they created.<br /><br /> Here`s the good:<br /><br /> -Building characters. You can customize your character in appearance and skill in a number of ways.<br /> -Additional characters. Along the way you meet main characters that become yours in taverns where you can add armor and skill points as they level up.<br /> -Armies. Depending on where you go you can build armies that specialize in different areas. Nords and Rhodoks are great for close combat and ranged weapons, where as Khegnate(SP?) and Sarranids are perfect, and almost unstoppable, with horses.<br /> -Leveling armies. With EXP each division in your army levels up gaining new armor and weapons as they go. You can`t choose the armor or weapons but the stuff that they get as they level is good enough without customizing.<br /> -Forging alliances. You can become a Vassal to a King and take on duties and a fief (Town, Kingdom) by completing quests and gaining honor.<br /> -Marriage. You can Court one or a few of the maidens you meet at Feasts meeting with them in secret and either proving yourself and marrying or having them elope with you.<br /> -Recruits. The more you help a town the more the towns` people are willing to follow you or fight alongside of you.<br /> -Espionage. You can gain knowledge about Kingdoms or certain people with the additional characters in your army, wife, or through close alliances with individual army leaders to help you later on.<br /> -Prisoners. You can take on and wipe out groups of Looters, Bandits, Searaiders, and Deserters imprisoning them for sale with a Slave Trader later on or simply to plunder their loot and claim it as your own.<br /> -Leadership. Depending on the decisions you make your additional main characters will either find you noble and wise and continue to follow you strengthening your alliance, or they will find you unfair and unwise and decide to leave your side taking with them the skills that benefit the party.<br /><br /> I could go on and on about the good but I`ll leave the rest for you to discover and experience.<br /><br /> The bad:<br /><br /> Sadly, the bad takes a lot of the wind out of this games sails and here`s why.<br /><br /> -You can`t kill a King or his generals. The only thing you can do is take them down to almost 0% imprison them for ransom or have them disappear when their faction is wiped out. This was a major mistake on the developers part.<br /> -Glitches. There are many glitches that appear throughout the game during play where it will either freeze up on you for a second or it gets choppy. Doesn`t take all that much away from the enjoyment of the game but it does annoy.<br /> -Building/adding to towns. You can manage a Fief/Town that you own and build certain things in them but depending on where the location is the town will always be poor regardless of it being looted or Bandits raiding it.<br /> -Impossible quests. Depending on whats going on in the game and the tasks you`ve chosen to undertake some quests are impossible to complete thanks to the timing or way the game has been programmed. Some quests are given out only during the worst of times where you`re constantly screwed and have no way to complete them. While others are glitched thanks to the developers not thinking things through more carefully.<br /> -Invisible walls. Depending on what you`re doing you will encounter invisible walls throughout the game. Not horribly annoying but annoying none-the-less.<br /> -Not open world. The large map you`re on when not in contact with someone or battle is a giant continent that you can explore. Not all that bad since its so vast but nothing beats open world.<br /> -Continuous enemies. Bandits and the like are constantly popping up out of the thin blue air in large numbers as if a magic wand had been passed over the area they appeared out of. The numbers get out of control and the groups become like cockroaches since there are so many.<br /> -Gaining honor. You can go to War under Vassalage and wipe out 3 or 4 generals and only get 1 point of honor for your efforts. This makes gaining enough honor almost impossible to get the King to give you another Fief or for that matter a Kingdom. By the time you have enough you`d be bored with the game and on to something else.<br /> -Limited choices available. Once you take a castle or Kingdom the King you`re under Vassalage to may or may not give it to you even if you beseiged it by yourself; and worse yet, there are no options for you to choose from in order for you to ask one of the Kings generals to come help you protect it from the armies that are on the way to take it back from you.<br /><br /> Again, I can go on and on about whats bad but if you do decide to give this game a shot I`ll leave the rest to your experience as each player will have a difference of opinion when they play.<br /><br /> Final thought:<br /><br /> This can easily be a great game if they just cleaned up the game play a bit and added more realistic content to the game they created (Offing Kings/generals). I was hooked for over a month managing, fighting, and rising in the ranks of Mount and Blade: Warband. But having no way to really eliminate the enemy, having the Kings your working for take away your prisoners once peace has been established and allowing them to keep coming back to irritate you, and the neverending monotony of the game play that makes up the whole of the game thanks to the two former complaints written, M&B:Warband falls short of being a game with amazing replay value and instead finds itself simply as a game that is fun but misses the mark in terms of being five stars. Worth checking out for the low price but be prepared for the monotony/irritation factor.<br /><br /> Thanks.d only get 1 point of honor for your efforts.

683	0	The Good: Shocking choices to be made, fun sand elements when they are there, lots of real world weapons, some epic set pieces, interesting characters<br /><br />The Bad: Sand elements are rarely used, monotonous shooting, boring environments, story doesn't really ever make sense, boring and average multiplayer<br /><br />I have to admit that I expected this game to be an absolute abomination like most of the past games in the series. I'm surprised that the game looks good, feels good, and has some shocking moments with an actual interesting story. This is something you wouldn't expect from a military shooter set in Dubai, but it's here to prove you wrong. The game has you following a team of three through Dubai trying to track down a man named Konrad who has led the 33rd battalion to go rogue. The story doesn't really ever make a lot of sense, but the shocking moments throughout are entertaining and memorable.<br /><br />The game has a lot of real world weapons to shoot and they feel good, but not as good as other shooters you have grown to love. Some weapons have some sort of alternate mode like burst fire, laser sight, grenade launcher, or a scope, but other than that the weapons are standard affair. The game tries to use environment as a weapon, but doesn't really pull through. You can shoot glass out glass that has a bunch of trapped sand behind it to bury enemies, but there's only a few spots in the whole to do this. There are some epic set pieces throughout the game like hanging onto a gas truck while firing a grenade launcher, using a mini-gun in a helicopter, and a few moral choice points in the game.<br /><br />These moral choices are pretty disturbing like seeing two men hanging from a freeway sign. You have to choose one or the other to survive. Another section has you firing white phosphorous down on soldiers, but you end up killing tons of civilians in the process. The cut scenes that lead up to, and after these moments are pretty shocking and gruesome. This is something I would not expect from a military shooter, and I hope others follow suit. In between these moments is just monotonous shooting and boring brown deserts to look at which really bring the great moments down. The characters are at least interesting as their mental state deteriorates as the game progresses and you start to feel for them which is also rare in military shooters full of cookie cutter one-man-armies.<br /><br />I constantly wanted more of those shocking moments, but they were far and few between. It was just bad guy after bad guy and they all look the same after a while. You can wander around and pick up intelligence items, but how many of us are tired of doing this in shooters? The cover system at least works pretty well and is similar to Gears of War, but not as fluid. Then there's the multiplayer that is standard affair and won't keep you coming back for very long.<br /><br />Overall, Spec Ops has some shocking story moments that give you choice and question your moral standards. In between these moments are monotonous shooting segments through boring and brown environments. Even the sand elements are not put to good use and are almost forgotten half-way through the game. This is a fun weekend rental, but don't expect any miracles.. This is something I would not expect from a military shooter, and I hope others follow suit.

684	-1	Okay, I got this game because I had a friend playing and we game alot of the same online stuff...well I installed it, and the game kept freezing.  I did all that Tech support asked me to do include unistall and reinstall and now the game won't even install, and Tech support can't get me past the errors. Greatly disappointed, and I can't even return it.
685	-1	I'm playing only RPG and was expecting more from this game (considering all the positive reviews). But there are too many bugs and glitches.<br /><br />First the game is limiting the texture resolution so it doesn't matter which screen resolution you choose - it will always look ugly/pixelated. There are community patches that remove this restriction but they are unofficial and cause other issues (at least to me).<br /><br />Keyboard handling is impossible. I've even tried using my Saitek gamepad but still it extremely difficult to control the player.<br /><br />As for the game (for 5h gameplay) - I was prepared for difficult game (from other reviews) but to me it is extremely stupid gameplay. You will die at least a hundreds time even before reaching boss number 2. To kill the boss you will have to perform repeating stupid moves (like climbing on a ladder then wait for the boss to be near and jump down on his head holding 2 keys).<br /><br />Well I like difficult games where you have to use tactics and different abilities but this game just not like that. The only way to kill bosses is to follow some manuals on the internet or find by chance. And dying is so often (because of the impossible handing) that you will probably regret that you started this game.<br /><br />Don’t bother with this one.
686	-1	I have been having issues downloading this game to my PS3 system.  I tried updating my system a few times but still no luck, I will try it again.
687	-1	Most games don't work on all computers regardless of whether your computer is 64 or 32 bit.<br />Red Alert 2 is a big example.
688	1	Excellent product and way to shop in Playstation Networks. It´s better ´cause you receive code directly by email as soon has you finish your buy.
689	0	https://www.origin.com/en-us/store/buy/simcity-2013-/mac-pc-download/base-game/standard-edition?utm_campaign=origin-search-us-pbm-g-sim13-e&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_term=simcity%20origin&sourceid=origin-search-us-pbm-g-sim13-e&boostid=4724473&gclid=CPqx04a228UCFQqGaQodEGcAkw<br /><br />This game is only 199.99 at origin which is the site you have to use to download it.  Amazon charged me 29.99
690	-1	I bought this because it was the same price on steam for 1 and 2 but not 3, so this was a better deal because you got all 3. However the crappy part is, you download the games, click on them, and nothing happens! I cant play ANY of them!! And it REALLY pisses me off!!!!
691	1	fast and easy!!
692	0	I haven't tried all the games, just wanted to play Tiberium Wars again for now.  Had all kinds of trouble getting it to work in Windows 8.1, would crash whenever I tried to change resolution.  So eventually got bright idea to run it in my copy of Windows Vista under Vmware Workstation 9 and it works perfectly with all 3D effects turned up to full!
693	1	Tropico 3 is a very fun game.  I downloaded it directly to my PC and had no problems with the download or getting the game working.  I do wish the game was slightly more difficult as many of the scenarios were completed fairly easily.
694	1	easy and fast
695	0	nothing like the original and the origin app sometimes works sometimes not.
696	0	well it was a quick easy download and install so 3 stars  though i cant play it as my computer is s*** and cant run this game
697	-1	This game should not even be allowed on the market. There is ZERO information on how to play it. There is a video 'tutorial' at the beginning that is just video. No explanation whatsoever as to what is going on.  I paid $3.99 for something that I wouldn't even call pre-alpha. A total waste of money and I'm really not even sure why it is even allowed to be sold here.
698	0	Bought it for a buck, you cant go wrong. But the main servers are going down now, so you will have to rely on the generosity of strangers.
699	1	win
700	-1	You receive a code, with no accompanying instructions. After some searching I located the &#34;Amazon Software Downloader&#34; and installed it.  Great!  I click the link and it will download my software. Right? Wrong. AmazonGSDownloaderService Error: Execution of command 'C:\Users.....\Amazon Games & Software\SteamCodeActivationInstructions.html' failed (error193:unknown error c1) After a little digging on my own, I located the missing file (LAZY CODING) which takes you to Steam. You must install Steam, (so why bother installing an Amazon downloader???!) and use your code.  The instructions are even a bit out of date. Just lazy and poorly explained.
701	-1	When will this be available on steam? I do not want any junk-ware on my pc... A good game shrouded in misery from ea game's origin.
702	1	Coolest and raddest literary dating sim in the world.<br /><br />But be warned—Mr. Darcy is hella hard to get unless you have a tonne of willpower. Be ware of tenacious Mr. Collins.
703	-1	I've downloaded the amazon App. and installed it on my hard drive but it keeps trying to install in a non existent drive. I have never had a problem with any-other program from amazon then this one. *After downloading Stronghold and seeing it work fine i know its not my p.c. Had to go to command prompt to delete the Battle Inc. Setup program.
704	1	Excellent product. The digital code is instantly delivered by Amazon to my e-mail and it can be redeemed in several storefronts (PS3, PS4, PS Vita or Sony webstore).<br /><br />It's a great option for those who don't own or don't want to use a credit card directly on the consoles, also very fast and reliable with no need to get out of home to go to a store.<br /><br />I've purchased this item several times from Amazon and never once had an issue. Amazing!
705	1	Do not be fooled, many people seem to think these are HD remakes of the original games. This is not the case. These are original PS1 games in all of their old school graphics glory, but they are playable on the PS3. Others still think this is a shameless way for Sony to make more money. They may be right, but I can fork over a little money to relive the games of my childhood. I certainly think this is worth the buy.
706	0	About what I expected. Melee works well but combat can get stale after awhile.  Quest variety is a bit low and you'll soon follow map to point without even knowing what the objective is.  Would be angry if I paid full but its only 5 bucks so I consider it value at that price.
707	0	It actually has almost nothing to do with the 'clockwork man', the girl's useless robot.  However, the varied scenes, good artwork, somewhat unique layout, storyline, and playability are all a bit above normal.
708	0	Okay. I know this is going to be controversial. I've taken my time to write this up so that the dust from the launch would clear.<br /><br />I like this game. I know it is not nearly as deep as SimCity 4, and SimCity 2000 will forever be my favorite game. That said, it is a great way to unwind after a day at work. The music is incredibly relaxing, and the visuals are beautiful. The mechanics of the game are not as complex as previous iterations, but it is still a fun way to pass the time.<br /><br />If you are looking for a complex and deep city builder I would recommend going back to SimCity 4, trying out Banished, or any number of old Impressions Games historical city building games.<br /><br />I do stand by my statement that it is a great way to kill time. Also, with the introduction of an offline mode (impossible my eye) it is now something that can be played easily on the plane.<br /><br />Would I pay $60 at launch for it again? Not likely. I would probably pay no more than $25. The numerous patches that have been rollled out really helped it, but it does not capture that same degree of strategy as the games I listed above.
709	1	Can't help myself keep adding the points lately.Still fast,simple and easy.Commander Shepard will be Pleased!!LOL<br />Keep rolling in the multiplayer games.Thanks a lot.Amazon!
710	1	This doesn't really require a review lol but I find online codes more convient than having to go to GameStop to purchase a card.
711	0	the game is a lot of fun but you must finish your term with 1 sim before you can even go back to aplay any other sim I feel that is a big mistake and don't know why the makers did that.
712	1	This is one of my favorite games from the past.  Worked with no problems on my 13&#34; macbook pro w retina.  Just make sure you right-click and choose &#34;open in a window&#34; for the first time.
713	1	"Shadow Empire is an outstanding game with astronomical production values. It takes gameplay from the likes of the old school Metroid series in terms of scope, explorability, and game balance and then meshes it into a setting reminiscent of Metal Gear (minus Metal Gear's crazy plot issues).<br /><br />As the game progresses your character becomes more and more capable and gains the ability to access hidden nooks and crannies in previously visited areas and blow past them with ease. The entire game feels like a beautiful treasure hunt - with guns and power armor.<br /><br />Even though your player's capabilities progressively increase towards near-godlike powers, the game keeps pace in the new areas you are allowed access to through these powers. The game throws larger encounters, tougher versions of enemies: elite troopers, big brutes with miniguns / rocket launchers, all the way up to tanks, mechs, and beyond.<br /><br />This is a game where you don't need to find everything to win, but spending the effort is very rewarding from a discovery point of view and also from benefits to your player.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Everything listed above. Superb game.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Would have liked one or two more guns<br />- Aiming at enemies that are \\""deeper\\"" than the horizontal plane you're on can be disorienting<br />- It can be frustrating in a few situations that your character refuses to walk a little deeper into the world (e.g. Do I really need to leap from one side of the stairs to another? Can't I walk a meter into the screen and follow the stairwell?)<br /><br />Minor gripes aside, awesome game. Gameplay really did come first in this one, but the graphics were beautiful."
714	-1	I cant change it in mi argentinian account u.u
715	0	Game play is at times neat and the concept of bio-engineering a body is indeed clever. However I didn't care a lot about  the game play. Just wasn't my cup of tea for a First Person shooter.
716	1	"This game is lots of fun for puzzle lovers with a bit of educational twist regarding the life of Francis Von Amadeus. . . puzzles range from simple to rather intriguing (as they do not come with a lot of instruction) so one has to \\""think\\"" to figure and work through some of them. I passed around my laptop while at a recent family gathering . . . several spent a good bit of time working together on the riddles. We really liked the options of \\""flipping\\"" from one view to another (of the same scene - in most of the riddles scenes).  I especially enjoy that the \\""time clock\\"" isn't too \\""pressing\\"", that is to say that you've got plenty of time to figure the riddles out.   I also like to \\""work\\"" on the puzzles during my lunch and save my progress when it's time to go back to work.  The puzzles/riddles are not unusually perplexing, and therefore, rather enjoyably relaxing.  The price is hard to beat for the amount of hours of pleasurable fun. . . ENJOY!"
717	0	Could have been a lot better imo. Same models over and over, no jump (wtf is that about lol?) The missions were kinda boring and enemies knew where I was at all times and would shot huge distances with simple weapons and hit me. Cool idea, poorly done.
718	1	I have 7-8 ND games and this one is alittle harder for some reason, I haven't finished it yet. Thank god for walk throughs. In this game Nancy is more like a spy than detective. Their are many, many things to do. It's one of the better ND games. Go to gameboomers and check out the walk throughs for all of her games. This is not for the beginners unless you love a challenge. Try it.
719	1	Fifa 13 is a football simulator which means EA tried to make it as real as possible. People are complaining that this game is hard or not that great, this is probably because they dont watch soccer on tv so they dont know that the only way to effectivly play this game is if you use your soccer iq and think of a strategy before each game you play. This game requires lots of practice just like real soccer, you cant just play it for 15 minutes and think you're good at it, i play on world class now and i started off on amatuer not too long ago. :-) Graphics are nicer than fifa 12 for pc, AI is super intelligent so you have to be aware of what you are doing at all times. The game feels much faster and more precise, every pass has to be carefully measured, and shots have to be very accurate some people dont like this but thats exactly how soccer is in Real Life. This game is overall very entertaing if you're a big soccer fan, and follow the game in real life if you're just starting out then you're gonna need to spend lots of time on the training ground.
720	0	"It wasn't the worst game I've ever played, but it certainly wasn't the best, either.<br /><br />Natalie Brooks: Secrets of Treasure House is a relatively short (about 3 to 4 hours of gameplay), simple, but thinly, plotted game.<br /><br />Natalie arrives home after many years of being away--her grandmother has passed and has left Natalie her estate, including an old hidden treasure located somewhere inside the house-- to a stranger cloaked in black lurking around.<br /><br />It is your basic Hidden Object Game (H.O.G), you find and click from a list of random items (i.e. a screw driver, a flute, a fire extinguisher) to collect \\""Hint coins\\"". Once you've received your \\""Hint coins\\"", you then read a letter left by Granny's attorney instructing you to call and see him. A Harry Potter Marauders' style map will instruct you on your journey (8 locations in total). Then you find clues (assorted objects/tools) that will direct you on your way to the (in my opinion, (not so) hidden treasure and the final task afterward.<br /><br />There are a few games/puzzles to be solved.<br /><br />One of them is timed and takes a lot of patience to complete, as it does get frustrating at times.<br /><br />Another is a Sling Shot wheel where you need to aim a sling shot at a spinning wheel of buttons. This one, too, can be extremely frustrating as it never stops spinning, but the simplest way to win it is to just tap each individual button until the ball taps it and changes from red to green.<br /><br />With cut scenes (while nicely done) looking like they were copied out of an old comic book or a Bazooka Joe gum wrapper and fast flashed speech bubbles, the ending of the game was really not what I was expecting ...and as that is solely my opinion, I will not say whether or not that is a good thing."
721	1	got the code and it's working, GREAT Reeview ?
722	1	This game had so many twists & turns it kept me addicted for hours!! LOVE this one! More than a 'follow the prompts' game -- it actually makes you think. Highly recommend this game!
723	1	It was awesome love Nancy drew games no problems with download
724	0	Just didnt operate as smoothly as I thought it should--not enough options--boreing  --would not recommend this game
725	-1	this game will not open. I have repaired it several times as well as reinstalling...still won't open. NOT COOL AT ALL
726	1	Excellent
727	0	the lag of this game is a serious issue
728	1	Excelent
729	-1	I Just bought this and When I try to redeem it it says.. Wrong code.<br />Waiting for An answer
730	-1	Would not load properly.  Just put me in a loop where I had to go to the Game Center and sign up for more games.  No Thanks
731	-1	So I brought this game and when I try to install it I get a message saying Object Already Exists. I have tried redownloading and changing setting on the pc but nothing works.
732	-1	We need our money back.<br />Because we don´t have de correct plataform
733	1	This game was so worth the money..couldn't wait to solve the puzzles to see what the next graphics would be like as each screen was so artfully and creatively done..lots of fun!
734	0	Bought it for Day Z modd, but the stand alone came out later. I must say the engine this game runs on is really sloppy.
735	0	Game won't advance after the normal level - can't unlock other levels.  I really loved playing it but that was a deal breaker.
736	-1	"There should be more to choose from as in countries. It's hard to attack the us because you can't make boats. Or vise versa. Other countries are easy. When I played as the ussr I attacked Germany, west. And Romania and won. But then the us sent 50 nukes repetitively over time and I had 1 nuke. China wouldn't interfere or canada or Britain. All countries are like \\""Yo if you attack me ill just chill and watch my own death.\\"""
737	-1	This game was not challenging and way too short. I was very disappointed and wish I had not bought it.
738	-1	After Fishdom, this is a match-3 that is boring.  It is slow, the graphics are childish and there just isn't anything to it.
739	0	Good game, short &#34;arcade version&#34;, which is what I expected from other versions of COD I have downloaded.  Unlike the previous versions, this one has problems from the beginning, which required me to hunt down the &#34;COD BO cheats&#34; (use that string in Google).  I had to get in a change settings to allow me to SAVE a game, then to change to different chapters in the game.  HELP is nearly useless and of course, there are no instructions.  But, most damning, I think, are the irritatingly LONG loading sequences before each game chapter begins.  And, there were some things in this game that were just dumb or counter intuitive.  There is a car getaway, an attack helicopter, and some other &#34;rides&#34; that are very arcade like in presentation and handling.  You do have to be able to quickly adapt.  But, old functions or moves were not like previous COD games, which I found much more interesting and faster paced  (COD 1-4 are worth the money, not so sure this one was, which is one reason I downloaded it rather that buy the disc)
740	1	sold for $ 100 in my country this game much more affordable price I got through amazon. I liked the game so criticized. That's why I'm giving it five stars. at this price, this new generation of game that allows me to purchase thank amazon. Yes google translate. :(
741	0	This is not a game but virtual world that people creat and sell things. It is interesting but that is about it.
742	1	The extra careers this expansion pack offers is enough for me to say that I won't play The Sims 3 unless I have Late Night to go with it. This is perhaps my favorite expansion pack. It's fun and expands the game in all the ways an expansion pack should -- hair, clothes, careers, and even vampires.
743	-1	can't even download. do not buy this item its a scam
744	-1	Allows me to pay for the games I need<br />Lousy way of collecting money when there is Paypal etc<br />Stay with the times, Sony!
745	-1	I can not install in any computer.  I can not install in any computer.  I can not install in any computer.  I can not install in any computer.
746	0	I got this game for free somehow; however, make that emphasis on FREE as don't pay for it if they're selling it.    The scenarios are dark, and this is harder on the eyes.  The levels are also a little more difficult and less fun than Ricochet Lost Worlds Recharged.
747	0	I like find object games with just a little puzzle action included. So this looked like just the ticket.  Death on the Nile was fun except for the tiny objects got pretty obscure to find at times, but I soldiered through.  Finished the first one in the 3 in 1 bundle only to discover I could not access the next two games.  Disappointing.
748	0	Overall probably the toughest combat in the series, very rewarding to beat certain sections.  However, they really cut down on the rpg elements of the game, resulting in less character conversation options and an overall lack of immersion.  The fleet collection missions which i had hoped would give me a cooler ending still only showed human ships at this &#34;final climactic battle for the galaxy&#34; despite my &#34;fleet&#34; having every race in the galaxy in it.  This shows on the ground of the final fight as well where only the core races are represented.  Overall, it felt like a serious step down from the first and second games, and were it not backed by such amazing previous games i wouldnt recommend it to anyone.  In the end its really just a dissappointment
749	-1	Not even worth the money if more than a dollar. The graphics are poor and out dated. Maybe for kids under 8 it would be good.
750	-1	"What is there?<br />great visuals? YES<br />great audio? YES<br />great anything else? NO<br />lots of glitchy crap? yes<br /><br />1. First thing that teed me off was the requirement to open a web page to start the game every time. very ridiculous.<br />2. How a pc game this day in age cant detect a pc 360 controller is beyond me. OH the controller works, but when an in-game hazard approaches like say oh i dont know- lets say a rat in a sewer- and he starts biting my finger.. onscreen flashes \\""click this mouse button\\"" to stop the rat from biting my finger. I fumble to put down the 360 controller and find th mouse to push the \\""anti-rat\\"" button. takes too long. RAT KILLS ME. (This is in the game btw) just dumb.<br />3. Another thing.. (ive only played the game for less than an hour btw).. Why in the year 2012 are enemies still shooting me through walls? and also why, when Im in-cover scoping down bad guys from 100 yds away, they turn 90 degrees and instantly shoot me from the hip without previously knowing i was there?"
751	0	The hidden object part of the game was pretty good, the yard sale part was not something I enjoyed, and the decorating the house part was, to me, a waste of time, and it didn't have much I liked for decorating anyway.  If I do replay the game, I will just stick with the hidden object part and skip the rest if I can.
752	0	Very similar to Bejeweled, only not as fun.  It runs a lot slower and just lacks the addicting element that the original has.  There are some original twists to this version, such as dropping the puzzle pieces to complete the level and completing puzzles to move on.  Also the board shapes vary as opposed to just being square.  Overall though it really didn't hold me.  I made it about ten minutes into the free trial before I closed it out.
753	-1	CANT USE TO BUY LIVE!  So you can no longer buy a 10$ live subscription codes?  BUT you CAN buy 10$ Xbox gift cards.  So what do you do?  Buy the gift card right and use it to buy the live?  WRONG!  You can NOT use this credit to buy a live subscription.  What a scam!  I just bought an Xbox One and I only have enough money left in the bank for 1 month.  But, now I have no money.  And 10$ in useless credit with Xbox.  How do they not accept their own currency?
754	1	Great price for this xbox 360 gold membership
755	0	This was nice addition to Tropico 3 and very inexpensive. I haven't played that much with it, but the expansion pack seems to have toughened up play a little, added several new buildings, etc. Everyone should be aware that there seems to be a problem with the installation of this addon. Several files are not changed out during the process. (See game forum for fixes) Some parts of the game work, others don't. If you see spinning white boxes and some other odd happenings, then you have the problem.
756	-1	Total scam!!!
757	1	I've been a plus member for two years now, and I've never looked back. Not only is all of your save data uploading to a cloud server for safe storage, but the selection of free games across the platforms is incredible! Over the years I've gotten some big name hits, like LBP 2, Borderlands 2, and even Arkham Asylum!
758	0	The reason I put that it was okay is that I could not get the game to finish downloading. I checked my computer..plenty of everything needed, I tried to get Amazon help..which was a washout. Went online to several sites and saw that others had the same problem with the downloading of the game. I gave up, I was disappointed as the first game was good.
759	1	As always a must for any Playstation user. Code got emailed instantly and worked as advertised.
760	0	I love games that have good graphics and a good story line. This has an audio story which I find annoying and the graphics on the women are poor. Ok to pass the time but I won't play it again.
761	-1	Does not Work for windows 7!
762	-1	then decided to start crashing. I have ininstalled, reinstalled, rebooted, and done every other trick in the book, in every sequence possible. Just keeps crashing now.
763	1	Great game. Weird dream-like trip full of surprises and puzzles. Like Twilight Zone.
764	1	This went on sale during the holidays and the price couldn't be beat.  It was quick and easy to install and offers hours of game play.
765	1	God
766	-1	I have a very high tech computer 8+GB Ram 2GB Video Card, quad core processor, 4 monitors.. you get the point and it just blanks out when I try to play it. I can normaly get games that dont work to work by changing the settings around but its a no go with this game. I also am using Win 7. Im sure its a great game really liked the first one but cant play it.
767	1	This is amazing quick and easy i love this so much you dont have to wait for it to get shipped to you thank you so much. :)
768	-1	I couldn't get the game to work and there is no way to ask for refund.
769	1	This Game was great ! and it worked perfectly, no problems at all. Thanks! I enjoyed it very much ha.
770	-1	Doesn't have enough facial feature control. I'll wait to actual purchase the product
771	0	"I had high hopes when Focus Home Entertainment announced CXL '12 but then quickly got mad and depressed because it was more of a expansion. It was depressing as Simcity Societies left a bad taste in my mouth and CXL '09 was a great attempt. CXL '11 added subways, elevated rails and buses along with some modest changes. The puzzling fact about CXL '11 was that it was 90% the same as Cities XL '09 all the way down to the bugs. CXL '09 was buggy but it was hit or miss. Some people reported that they were getting error messages, wrong serial numbers, and constant crashing. Luckily I didn't encounter any of the above mentioned bugs and crashes. I'm a realism nut and I love city building games. I played the very first Simcity all the way to Simcity Societies. I've also played City Life (this was how I knew Monte Cristo who also developed Cities XL '09) Monte Cristo had grand plans for CXL but unfortunately they made a very bad bet on online city play. I will give Monte Cristo props for trying something new and from what they were promising, it looked like CXL would be the great successor of the SimCity Franchise. Monte Cristo was good at making announcements as well as answering emails quickly. Sadly, Monte Cristo was not a EA company and by far, didn't have EA's funds. MC went bankrupt and Focus Home Entertainment took over.<br /><br />One of the bugs that drove me insane was how weird traffic moved. In a 2 lane avenue (or higher), cars in the left lane would make a right and cars in the right lane would make a left. Very unnatural. Since I'm a realism nut, this drove me insane. The traffic lights were static and had no animation. The cities lacked the hustle and bustle of the streets we are normally accustomed to in real life. I would of loved to be able to create parking lots and see animation that showed cars parking the street. All the bugs and realism bugs (traffic) mentioned above, carried over in CXL '12.<br /><br />The graphics really carry this game. If the graphics were not good, this would easily be a 1 star game in my mind. What I loved about the CXL series was it's menus which to me were not confusing, easy to use, and the same goes for the charts. The curved roads made cities very realistic and the fact that you can rotate the zones according to the curvature of the road. I loved how bus stops didn't take up tiles (aka valuable real estate) like in Simcity). I was so in love with making the bus and subway lines. You could set different tax rates for the different zones and business types. You really had to plan when creating a city in CXL. You could go bankrupt very easily. Simcity was more of plop and wait plop and wait. Making specialized cities was a joy but I do miss how I can connect cities in Simcity. Also, the expressway tiles stink but I do like how you can elevate roads (which can be frustrating as is terraforming).<br /><br />Cities XL 2012 only adds several maps to choose from, 300 buildings, and modding for the first time. What was unbelievable was the absolute devoid of information by Focus for the whole life of this franchise. Trying to get information was worse than pulling teeth. When they did make announcements it was very brief. When I found a lot of bugs, I emailed Focus as well as post them on their forums and not surprising, I got no answer. There was a patch but most bugs still persisted.<br /><br />Basically, if you want a review on CXL '12, please see my review on CXL '11. If you have CXL '11 and like modding, then the $14 ($10 now as I type) is a good deal. If you like realism, you will be as frustrated as I am. Every year a CXL comes out and it seems like it's almost the same thing and what to be is the most obnoxious thing about this, the bugs, crashes, and complaints carry over. Please be advised, dual-core processors are not optimized for CXL '12 (neither was '11).<br /><br />City Building fans will be so happy though. I just heard yesterday, Sim City IS COMING BACK in 2013. Seems like theMaxis developers (some from the past Simcity's) are working on a reboot of Simcity and is expected to be ready in 2013. Yeah, I was hoping since it was announced that it was going to be released soon. They were accepting preorders already but much to my dismay, I saw, \\""Coming in 2013). I hope the Maxi developers looked at CXL and saw what worked and what failed. The graphics look great and it looks promising. I have high hopes, but then again, when I saw the announcement for Cities XL in 2009, I was ecstatic. After a while, I it started to get stale. Then CXL '11 made me feel like I was tricked. I enjoyed it and felt, hey, the next one could finally be THE ONE. CXL '12 made me angry and I rarely play it anymore. The only reason I bought it even though on the CXL forums, I announced that I was no longer buying any CXL games until they stop rehashing it (CXL '11 and '12) was because I had enough Amazon points to not even pay a dime and my points were just sitting there. Sadly, CXL '12 is more of the same from the past CXL's. Focus rarely will email you back and if they do, it's days later.<br /><br />*See my CXL '11 review for full coverage of this game*Maxis developers (some from the past Simcity's) are working on a reboot of Simcity and is expected to be ready in 2013.

772	0	I liked the game okay but it was just okay. I had trouble with graphics though. They kept jumping and at times part of the picture was whited out. Very annoying. My PC is less than a week old with Windows 7. Glitch-y program I guess.
773	0	1) The game mixes BO2 with a bit of Cod 4 and speeds up the gameplay you will die, and die again.<br />This is Call of Duty, just a few new game modes (some are missing like Headquarters).<br /><br />Their create a soldier is a step forward for the series, but I question their judgement on a few of the perk choices (some should be combined into one perk (example marathon/ready up) while others should be brought down in point cost.<br /><br />The killstreaks are lack-luster as well, besides the Helo-Scout (snipe from a helicopter), they are pretty disappointing.<br /><br />The gun on gun gameplay is very fun, I like their gun choices (my favorite edition being the marksman class rifles).<br /><br />If you are a CoD fan, then you will enjoy this, it might take you to rank 25, but once you learn the maps you will feel right at home.
774	0	great
775	-1	I didn't play Tropico games before, but I like strategies in general.<br />This game doesn't look like a good one. There are lots of issues. Here are just few of them:<br /> - if you want to build a few structures, the workers build only a first one and then stop working;<br /> - no help or user manual at all; no learning campaign or hints;<br /> - other issues that make learning/playing really hard.<br />Overall, I dissatisfied with this item.
776	-1	I really wanted to like this game. After its catastrophic launch with no one being able to play I was hoping they would work out the kinks and get it fixed. But alas, all they did was throw more kinks into it. I've gone through three rounds now of the game being updated and becoming unplayable. EA has thrown so much nonsense between their players and their game that it boggles my mind. It's like buying software from the DMV. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or your money.
777	1	This was what I needed. I had no complications with the code and it was $20 cheap than anywhere else!
778	-1	Even though the graphics are pretty good the gameplay is monotonous and you'd be lucky to get more than an hours play time out of this. A big negative is theres's no online play to enjoy with your friends. Online play was the real game maker of the original and leaving that out just killed this game.
779	0	cant get it to work with custom maps
780	-1	only reason it got 2 stars from me is becuase the price was so low. If I had paid full retail, I would be PISSED.<br /><br />very linear, predictable, with subpar graphics on PS3.  Storyline also does not do it for me.  Im not the biggest warhammer fan, but gerneric is the only word i could use for it. It was relseaed less than a year ago, and yet looks and plays like something from 5 years earlier.<br /><br />Good way to kill an afternoon or two, but if youre looking for anything more than a budget game you will be very dissapointed.
781	-1	Ultimately this is a very poorly designed platform jumper.. designed solely to frustrate.<br /><br />The jumping difficulty has been overdone... and gets somewhat mundane after a while.<br /><br />Not worth the money.
782	1	The maps could be better, but overall the game is very good.  I am looking forward to the upcoming patch.  I am little concerned about the survivability of the game.  It seems less and less have been online and the game is only about a month old.  I play multiplayer online almost exclusively, so I can't offer much about the single player game or zombies.  This is a better COD game than Black Ops 1.
783	1	good
784	1	This was a great 3 pack deal. I have enjoyed playing these games very much. The graphics are very good. All the games work well on Windows 7. If you are a 1st person shooter type, you will like these games.
785	1	One Star until I can get this code to work.  It just keep going straight to home screen after I hit continue. Will update once it takes the code.<br /><br />Update:  Was finally able to get the code to work fine once the Sony Servers where back up and running.  Redeemed my 12 month subscription.
786	-1	its ok for the price, a good time waster but not much to do.
787	-1	How many years is the price of this game going to stay as high as a new game? Maybe when Black Ops III comes out, this will be around $20.
788	0	This game is fun for a while, then it gets boring. And then I'll be bored one day and play it again...Great for boredom.
789	-1	The game hasn't changed very much but forcing one to use Origin to play it ruins the game. I have purchased this game in the past and never had this problem. I wasn't aware of the Origin link or didn't understand it when purchasing the game. Maybe there are better places to buy games. I am very disappointed with Amazon for allowing this.
790	0	it was great at first but as soon as i was getting the umbrella it wouldn't let me use it, which was a bummer. I eventually bought it for my ps3 and its a wonderful game.
791	1	You'll get plenty of hours of fun out of this game.  However, once you know what you're doing, you won't be playing this game after you finish it once or twice.
792	1	Renegade Ops is good game i very like it.Hope can have better sega game Introduce more more DLC .have a nice day
793	0	Maybe not worth your money as it does not add any elements I use consistently (except for futurized parks, but really $20.00?) would be better if it cost maybe $5-10 since the actual game cost $20 and it is not as good as a brand new game, it doesn't even feel like one usually.
794	1	Saves you the hassle of buying a PSN game card load from your local game store.<br />But for those people who have a PSN account outside the US, this digital code does not work for you. even if you are using a Canadian PSN account, this will not work. I have tried it once, bought a $50 PSN gift card and it did not work, after weeks of researching over the internet, made a US account, tried my code and DONE, got it.
795	-1	Based on the reviews, I thought this was going to be a much more challenging game.  Instead, it's quite predictable and borderline boring.  Once I reached the end, it was &#34;Congratulations&#34;, and basically, start over again.  I'm pretty disappointed.
796	1	I love this game, and since it came with premium, that just makes it even better! :) So I Would recommend this to a friend! :D
797	-1	Amazon's shipping are worst than s***. If you choose free shipping. They gonna wait days then start send it. Cuz then want you pay or pay more on shipping. And also they can sell you Prime for money! Money! They just don't deal with free shipping order. So I'm just not going to give to you!! S*** Amazon, S*** money!
798	0	Fun game but playing online is kind of a bust because if the host of your game loses and he leaves the game it boots everyone. Also the game bugs out and randomly stops the selling/buying of houses witch kills the game. If they can get theses bugs fixed it could be fun.
799	0	Games for windows live sucks but the game isn't half bad. Its nothing to go crazy over and for 5 bucks its worth it.
800	1	I really enjoyed this stuff pack - between the new furnishings and clothing. It's really added to my game. I don't regret purchasing it.
801	-1	Downloaded like a champ, but cannot keep ANY found items. :( Would really just like to have my money back.
802	1	I couldn't play the first FEAR (video card wasn't new enough) when it first came out. Now, I've played all of them on campaign. I'll be playing multiplayer soon. Excellent game series, especially FEAR 3. Well worth the money.
803	1	Very simple for a board game thats played on the PC.  Its fun and easy to learn.  I love the fact that they support online play.
804	1	Item worked as advertised and was simple to redeem. Will use this site again for the purpose of reloading the funds on ps4
805	1	I love these games, boarder lands is awesome it's very fun to play and has a huge open world and great missions.
806	0	Games awesome but i have high speed internet and it still took 2+ hours to download. Also after installed another hour in patches.
807	0	A little glitchy and a pain to get running properly on windows 8.1, but lots of fun. Certainly not a game for the light hearted, if you don't care for graphic violence do not play these games!
808	0	Not all the best games are included. I had the Sega Genesis growing up. So I bought the game on a Black Friday price special. The main games I wanted Columns, Sonic sequels, and Shining Force games. The control system of the some guys are not perfect. So playing the games sometimes feels rough. Graphic wise you know what your getting. If you like retro Sega you should get it. If not don't spend the money.
809	0	"I've only played about 20 minutes of the free trial and probably won't be purchasing this unless it goes on a deep discount; it's really not that different from other entries in the series.  (I've played Build-a-Lot on the iPod and then bought #4 in the PC series.)<br /><br />You're building dens and cottages and manors (those are the first 3 unlocked options I made it to) instead of different types of houses, but it's basically the same -- you need a certain amount of materials and workers to build, upgrade or paint your dwellings to increase the amount of rent you make on a regular basis.  There are some cute differences in that some of the property you're given at the start of a level might be a stand of trees which you can cut down for either money or material.  The workers are fairies.  And, instead of your house just suddenly needing repair, occasionally a dragon will show up to start it burning and you need to extinguish the fire (instead of repairing it.)  The area in which you can build is limited, so it's not an open \\""sand box\\"" in which you can play.  There are goals you must meet before you can go to the next level, such as having 3 painted cottages and 4 fairies, or you must demolish 2 houses and reforest 3 areas, that type of thing. If you need a property that is \\""owned\\"" by the game, you have to wait until the game decides to put it up for sale and hope that -- at that particular time -- you have the money to purchase it. And each level is timed, so you really can't sit there and just play until you get something that is pleasing to you. There is a \\""casual\\"" mode that gets unlocked after you successfully complete about 4 levels and it looks like all the options are available for you to play with in that mode, though the area in which you can build is still limited to the same amount as in the timed levels.<br /><br />It downloaded and installed just fine on my Windows 7 netbook.  The graphics are pretty; I keep speakers turned off so I can't speak to anysounds in the game.  You can replay any level you've either successfully completed or unlocked, later levels in the \\""storybook\\"" or what I call 'timed' mode are locked.  Casual mode, after you've unlocked it, seems to allow access to later levels (presumably more expensive domiciles and other structures I hadn't yet unlocked after 20 minutes of play.)<br /><br />I should probably give it a 4 star rating, but frankly I didn't find it different enough from Build-a-Lot 4 to get it past my \\""oh, it's ok\\"" feeling so I'll leave it at 3 stars.  Certainly if you like the fairy tale setting or have not played any of the earlier entries I have no qualms about suggesting you start with this one if only because it's specifically rated to run on Windows 7.  (I'm always leery about buying a game that claims to run on only earlier versions of my operating system; sometimes they run and other times they don't.  If you have a fairly new computer, particularly if you have not purchased earlier entries in this series, I really do believe this one is your best bet.  The gameplay seems to be exactly the same as the previous games, just the pictures/descriptions/tokens used have been changed to fit the fairy tale theme.)  I also find the price -- in the $5 - $10 range -- to be reasonable as it took me 20 minutes to make it past the first 4 of 35 levels, with the option of casual play giving you basically unlimited replay value."
810	0	"This game is pretty much Pharoah/Cleopatra set in Rome.  There are a few differences, but even more similarities.  This, like Pharoah, is an older game, and some people may be turned off by the thought of pixelated graphics.  However, because most PCs are newer, you can max out the graphics without affecting gameplay and it actually looks nice, not boxy or blurry at all.  Sometimes when I start the game (DL version) I get an error message or a window that says the program is not working; I hit cancel and start it again, and it starts on the second time every time. Overall, if you liked Pharoah you should like this.  It's a standard city builder that's enjoyable if you like that game style. You build or repair a city, people show up, and you put them to work. The military campaigns are not that great, so you might want to look elsewhere if you're more into battling than building. Using Pharoah as a comparison since they're so similar, here's a quick run-down of some highs and lows:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. As your houses upgrade, you can actually click on them and select \\""Move House\\"" to put the new upgraded house somewhere else.  Not realistic, I know, but it beats having to tear down entire neighborhoods (having the houses devolve as you go) to make room for all the new stuff improved houses need.  In this game, when a house is ready to upgrade, just pick it up and drop it in a new area--then build your upscale neighborhood around it.<br />2. Needs and demands are more reasonable here than in Pharoah.  One temple or marketplace will serve a fairly large area, and the fancier the house, the farther away things can be and still count.  In Pharoah, you could have a temple crammed on every corner and people would still cry that they didn't have adequate access to religious facilities.<br />3. People will work your jobs no matter where you put them.  Mines, mills, and farms only need to be close the their natural resources, not your housing.  In pharoah, job sites standempty if they aren't very close to where your people live. Not so here. Houses also do not devolve due to unattractive surroundings.  A fancy house can sit right next to a storage yard.<br />4. Far less time and materials are required for large-scale builds like the colisseum; the pyramids or monuments in Pharoah took forever and used up all your storage yards for building materials.<br />5. Map editor lets you create your own custom maps and missions, just like Pharoah/Cleopatra.<br />6. You can play campaigns or simple sandbox.<br />7. You can do research that cuts building costs and makes improvements in your city.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Trade is available but more limited than in other games.  You may only get one or two cities to trade with in each mission, or may be able to only trade one commodity.  Each thing you trade also requires a separate shipping dock or caravan--which gets costly and crowded; i.e. trading wheat, stone, and iron requires three separate shipping docks or caravan stations.<br />2. In the world/map editor, you can't edit trade or modify trade cities/routes.  You have to pick a \\""region\\"" to build your map and whatever cities and commodities come with that region is what you get to use.  You can edit pretty much everything else.<br />3. There are not many missions/campaigns, and you go through them pretty quickly on the easy or normal levels.  You can always replay then on the hard level or customize for basically unlimited playability.<br />4. Military battles are doable, but frustrating.  You get very little time to build an army, and have limited weapons.  Horses/chariots are for arena sports only, you get none for military use--only foot soldiers with choice of either sword or javelin.  Your enemies, however, come mounted--often on elephants.  Fortunately you can choose to play only civilian campaigns if you just like to build, but that cuts the number of available missions you can play.  You can get past the military stuff by changingthe difficulty to Easy if you want to play all the missions.<br />5.  THERE IS NO UNDO BUTTON here.  If you place something and don't like where you put it, or drop the wrong thing on your map, you paid for it.  Your only choice is to delete it and try it again.  You don't get the build cost back, but at least you don't have to pay to demolish structures.  Just be careful when you're placing expensive buildings and get it right the first time.<br /><br />The game definitely has a few pitfalls and could stand a few improvements, but it's still a fun game if you miss the old sandbox/city builders like Pharoah and Caesar.  It's something to do while you wait for a new version of Pharoah or Children of the Nile."
811	1	Great Game
812	1	Works great !
813	0	It is what it is.  Best way to buy points, tax free.  Don't bother with in dashboard purchasing.  This is the way to go.
814	1	Liked the game but it showed up as a safety threat on my computer so I deleted it. I would like to keep it but must protect my computer
815	-1	The fact that it took almost 24 hours to download sucked. It then wouldn't let me play because something was wrong with the download link. But I started my computer and it worked. Basically my first impression about this was it wouldn't work. But I was lucky it did this game is so much fun. C:
816	0	Not user friendly. Not that exciting to play as I remember the first one was. At times challenging figuring out what to do and how to do it.
817	0	I don't often write product reviews, and I particularly don't like to write them if they're not positive. But I do have a point to make, which I hope will help other folks looking for solitaire games. SEVEN SEAS SOLITAIRE has, to my mind, a fatal flaw--when you start play, arrows pop up to show the cards you should choose. As a lifelong poker player, I'm stunned by this. The whole point of cards is to figure out which ones to play and how to play them. Maybe it's intended for very young children, but for adults looking for a decent game of solitaire--at least for me--it's a spoiler. You can get around this by going into free play mode, but then, as near as I can tell, you're outside the main / pirate game. The same thing is true, by the way, with the AVALON (or Legends of Avalon?) solitaire game--you can free play but you're not in the larger game, so you're just playing straight solitaire. By my lights, both games are mediocre in terms of presentation, card design, etc. So what's the point in paying for these, instead of getting an online freebie? The other one I've tried is Emerland, which doesn't prompt you as above, and has much more attractive cards and setup (although the larger framing game is very thin). My beef here is that the cards are often displayed at angles or horizontally, which I guess the designers considered cute but makes them hard to read without contorting your computer and/or head. All that said, any of the three games will help you pleasantly while away some time. I just wish somebody would combine their good elements without the dumb ones.
818	1	I thought that this was a good game. Most of the review said it was really bad or really good, so I wasn't sure about purchasing this. But it was definitely worth the 2.99 I paid for an online download! Worth the purchase :)
819	0	The game has fairly good graphics and the action is in the right place. The gameplay doesn't change much throughout the game though, and while it sometimes gives you powerful weapons to play with, these are during short and specific sections. Otherwise combat tents to devolve in later stages in attempting to do as much damage as possible to a highly armored target or targets while using the hack button to bring down their shields.<br /><br />Enjoyable experience but didn't hold interest long enough to finish.
820	1	i love this product so very much. i recommend this to everyone. i absolutely love love LOVE this product i really do.
821	1	Worked great!  I get my grandson one every year and he lives it!  Online transmission has made him even happier with the gift since he gets to use it sooner.
822	1	It still angers friends of mine that I picked up this combo for as little as I did.  Both games are good in their own way, even if GTA IV's driving engine takes some getting used to.  The stories are still fun and immersive, like prior entries in each series, though I wouldn't go so far as to say the stories are better in any way.  Overall, they serve their purpose, and the combo was a heck of a lot cheaper than the individual game prices at the time.
823	0	im upset my dlc code didnt work for the date night package... enter on origin and it says invalid... all the other ones worked tho thank god, so if you really want the date night ur not gonna get it here, or maybe im just unlucky
824	1	Love this game. Morality/choice system is ahead of many games being released today. Fell in love with the story and characters. Worth replaying at least once, if not many times!
825	-1	can't be played, mouse is stuck going up.
826	-1	Played the game for a little while and gave up because I got frustrated with the PC controls.  Exploring and looting was a pain as well.  Classing system and inventory is not intuitive at all and confusing. Expected way better. The first 2 were much better.  Probably ok on the console, but horrible on the PC
827	-1	disappointed in this game fps wont work..... if they fix the bug then... maybe we'll talk about this game ...
828	0	fun for the price
829	1	Ok.
830	0	Accidentally bought two and I don't know where or who to talk to about it. I recommend buying the disk instead of download .
831	-1	Where is Predator standalone? I just want the character.
832	-1	If you have a slow computer do NOT buy this game, you will not be able to play it without a frame drop every three seconds
833	1	Is fantastic. I don't have words to describe this. I'm very happy with the product. Thanks for the time of answer.
834	1	went to play it and during the game Trojan and ccleaners download and installing by them selves telling me I had problems but when I go on my own cleaners I had no problems.
835	-1	it did not run correctly and made my computer act strange. Would not recommend to anyone this game has something odd in it.
836	-1	servers have not worked since launch. I will never give EA another dollar, they have burned me for the last time. EA deserves to go bankrupt.  I would give them a little more leeway if this were an MMO or if it were 5 years ago.  It is unacceptable in 2013 to have a launch like this.  I'm so glad I didn't schedule vacation time to try to log into a game I've loved my entire life and sit here doing nothing.
837	0	This game is not at all what I expected it to be.  I used to love playing Zoo tycoon and I thought this might be an upgrade from that program.  It is not at all like it.  I did not say it was terrible, because it is a great learning game for kids.  Overall it is an ok game, but wish I would have downloaded Zoo Tycoon instead.
838	-1	I was unable to finish the game due to a glitch.
839	-1	While the story and art work are some of the best I've seen, the game stopped at the beginning and would not work again.  I started the game over and the same spot at the painting would not go on.  There is no escape to help you leave the area.  Very disappointing.
840	-1	I purchased this version over the PC Download version because it advertised additional DLC.  Admittedly I have little experience with Steam, but it was not clear at all that use of the game would be restricted to only one user.  I've requested a refund exchange to the PC Download version from Amazon.  We'll see what they say.  In the meantime, if you have multiple users, this is not the 'droid you're looking for.
841	1	Very good as expected. Loved the donuts! I've never been disappointed with Alawar games.I will continue to buy with confidence.
842	0	Not really being into games and such, this was the first game I have ever purchased.  Even though it does say &#34;Download&#34;, I thought that meant I only had to download it onto my computer when I bought it, and then it would be on my harddrive.  I had played a Mahjong game over the internet back in mid-July, and shortly after I got Malware on my computer.  It may have had nothing to do with the game, but I felt it did, so I did not want to have to play a game ever again that I had to connect to the internet in order to play it.  I was very disappointed when I realized that was what I bought - a game that had to download from the web each time I used it.  The few times I played it I did really like it, but gave it 3 stars since it has to go over the internet each time you want to play it
843	1	game was everything I hoped for, but be aware that your cd-keys probably wont work. You'll need to contact EA/Origin support and have them issue you new cd-keys.
844	-1	Cards too small on display, does not follow traditional solitaire rules for moving stacks from column to column (allows too many cards per move), and a few other similar programming shortcuts. Cheap design. Don't waste your time.
845	0	These games are both pretty good but they are highly repetitive.  Single player is a bit short and filled with missions that all feel identical and have you running between the same spots over and over.
846	-1	I wasted my money on this.  Never use it.  Well, I did download some free games and wall paper, but deleted them afterwards because they were not any good.
847	1	"Stronghold Collections gives you four different releases of Stronghold all in one for $20, which is an excellent deal.  All versions are released by Firefly Studios and all are safe for tweens.  Each version has both an economic campaign and a combat campaign.  All are Real Time Strategy games, based around the concept of a strong medieval castle defense.  In virtually every campaign combat mission you are either defending or besieging a castle, only rarely do you both start with your own castle.<br /><br />The versions are all similar in that you have to gather resources, which you can use to build your defenses and also manufacture armaments to create more combat units.  There is no fog of war, which I found refreshing and a good change from normal RTS fare, but some might find the ability to see everything on the entire map unnerving.<br /><br />I advise avoiding the Steam compilation at any price.<br /><br />There are some minor annoyances that exist in the entire series, such as the minimap being virtually useless, but, overall, the Stronghold series is a very good RTS with hundreds of hours of gameplay across four versions of the game.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some amazing positives that run throughout the series, like a very strong defense that does not need micromanaging while you concentrate on your attack.  I could find no software bugs nor memory leaks in any of the versions, and the game ran perfectly, even on low-end machines and laptops.  Path finding was mostly acceptable.<br /><br />The modes of your soldiers - stand ground, defensive and aggressive, seem to work well.  Most versions of the game seem to support a virtually unlimited number of soldiers, unlike an artificial population cap most games have.  In one game I had over 1,000 troops!  The physics realism are well thought out.  Different units have vastly different capabilities and how you place them, what mode they're in and what you tell them to do is vital to success.  In most RTS games it is nothing more than crank-them-out and send-them-in.  If you do that here, you will suffer huge losses.  This game requires strategy and it is very refreshing to see a Real Time Strategy game that actually requires strategy.  You will feel like you're playing an old strategy board game, but in real time.<br /><br />Stronghold<br /><br />The original game.  Graphics are old by today's standards and controls are simple, but still quite adequate - having zoom and fullscreen functions were real innovations when released.  The AI does not cheat.  There is multiplayer, but only player versus player.<br /><br />The original continues to have the best combat campaign of the series.  It is very well play tested and quite entertaining.  Your King is abroad fighting a war, and four Lords have taken over England whilst he was away, killing your family in the process.  You start with a rag-tag group, receive instructions from two members of royalty still loyal to the King, and slowly take back the nation.  However, due to a patch that increased the firing distance of archers on towers, two of the siege scenarios are unwinnable without cheating - mission 18 and mission 21.  To win them, download the mission saves from the Internet from versions before the patch.  There is a good 80 hours of gameplay or more in this campaign.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the original economic campaign is quite annoying.  Every scenario is very tightly timed and you have absolutely no time except to meet the minimum requirements specified for victory.  Wasting time or resources building, gathering or manufacturing anything except what you need for victory will often yield defeat.  Playing the economics campaign is a rushed, frustrating and frenzied hassle.<br /><br />Stronghold Crusader<br /><br />This update to the original Stronghold is much like the original.  Same graphics and controls, but adds some very interesting features.  Fire being used as a major weapon and mercenaries being the two most significant.  There is nothing like watching an entire enemy castle burn.  Again, the AI plays fair.  The setting of Crusader is, as you might expect, during the first Crusades.  Therefore most scenarios are on a sand-filled map and farms can only be built near oasis.  Firefly also added cooperative multiplayer against the AI to Crusader and it is great fun working with your buddies to keep the enemy at bay, then working together to storm their castle using multiple tactics.<br /><br />The combat campaign in Crusader is much more difficult than the original and not as well tested.  There are some balance issues.  For example, the horseback archer is such a powerful unit that there is usually no reason to create anything else, and since it is a mercenary unit, it is easy to ignore almost all aspects of your economy except making money, and this detracts from the game.  Further, the storyline leaves you completely dry and is forgettable - not compelling at all.<br /><br />The economic campaign in Crusader suffers from all the problems of the original.<br /><br />Stronghold 2<br /><br />This is the first modern and major update to the Stronghold series.  Graphics are up to modern standards as well as controls.  Unfortunately, the makers also introduced the concept of a cheating computer.  The AI cheats - it is given troops, resources and weapons at regular intervals.  It is impossible to damage the AI's economy and win.  It is impossible to wear him down over time because everything you destroyed will be instantly rebuilt when you come back again.  The only way you can win is to completely annihilate him in one single battle.  This, in my opinion, is a severe drawback to this update.<br /><br />But, there are some good points.  If your name is not too unusual, the game will verbally welcome you by name when you start the game.  The number of things you can do and build is amazing, and the attention to detail is nothing less than jaw-dropping.  Both Legends and \\""2\\"" are built around the same engine and even share graphics settings.  Unfortunately, Firefly somewhat weakened defense capabilities and increased offensive capabilities - this means that you have to pay close attention to your castle when under attack, micromanaging solutions.  If you are attacking simultaneously, you often have to let your attack go unmanaged while working your defense, and this is a serious step back from the older versions, making the gameplay very similar to every other RTS out there.<br /><br />This version of Stronghold adds many, many new features.  So many, in fact, that single player scenarios and multiplayer games are virtually unplayable.  There is some type of event every 30 seconds or so, like a criminal, fire, disease, gong, rats, sick cows, famine, etc, etc, etc.  It just becomes a micromanagement nightmare.  But the campaigns overcome this too-much-to-handle problem in interesting ways.<br /><br />One new feature is breaking the playing map up into counties - some of which are territories originally not controlled by either side, but could be captured and used to increase the economy of your estate.  You can build any building of any type in captured counties except defensive structures, basically running each county like your original.  The inability to build new castles in the estates, however, is a serious drawback in the game and is an absolutely annoying artificial restriction.  It forces you to micromanage defenses of your new estates rather than build them up.<br /><br />There are many resources instead of just the usual wood, gold and stone.  Most of the resources are things your citizens build themselves, so instead of just resource extraction your economy includes manufacturing, taxation and managing expansion estates<br /><br />The life-like realism and attention to detail are astounding.  The number of things to do are incredible.  You can build a stage where travelling shows come to town.  You can build a jousting arena where your knights fight for favor.  If you zoom in on the King's chamber, the food server will place the food you created in front of the King and bow several times while backing away from the table, the King will even burp after eating.  The King and \\""Lady in Waiting\\"" will dance, with the Lady wearing new dresses from cloth you create from sheep farms and spinning houses.  If you put too many hunter's houses near a herd of deer or a flock, they will hunt them to extinction, and the hunter has a dog to retrieve geese.  Chickens scurry about trying to stay out from under foot and wheel.  Babies are born, grow up to be children and run around playing.<br /><br />The people can get sick, but you can build an apothecary to cure them.  Rats spread disease, but you keep rats at bay with falcons.  Buildings catch on fire, but... you get the idea.<br /><br />The combat campaign overcomes the cheating flaw by heavily scripting events.  The campaign starts well enough, but there are some scenarios that are virtually impossible to win.  It turns out that the game was tweaked with a patch and changes were made that make playing the campaign nearly impossible to complete without downloading cheat files from before the patch.  The storyline is good and about three-quarters of the way through you do get to select the \\""good\\"" or \\""evil\\"" paths for the last three scenarios.  But gameplay is nowhere near as good as the original.<br /><br />The economics campaign, on the other hand, is a delight and the best of the series.  You play the entire campaign on a single map and everything you build carries over from scenario to scenario.  Basically, you build up and slowly take over the entire map, one county at a time as each scenario is given to you.  Make sure you save before exiting because the game does not save your place between scenarios.  It is quite kewl to have a campaign where everything you did before you get to keep.  In almost every other RTS, you start fresh on each scenario and have to do the same thing over and over again.  One caveat, however, the very last economic scenario suddenly has you needing vast sums of goods for the King's kitchen, so when you take over a couple of county's with lots of free land in the middle of the campaign, build lots of kings kitchen farms and ponds.  There are between 60 and 80 hours in the economic campaign and most scenarios are not timed so you can build a very powerful land!<br /><br />Stronghold Legends<br /><br />Firefly, noting that players could not realistically play Stronghold 2 in multiplayer, released a stripped-down version while simultaneously attempting to create a StarCraft-like game with three different races.  In all prior versions, all sides were the same.  Unfortunately, Firefly failed miserably with this effort as the sides are very unbalanced.  The evil side, with a couple of werewolves, can easily beat both other factions.  The ice side can easily beat the human side.  Further, the AI cheats exactly as badly as it did in Stronghold 2.  Defenses against evil are severely crippled.<br /><br />The one positive addition to Legends is that you can now set automatic buy and sell amounts at the Market.  Some blogs post that the only reason to play Legends at all is so you can get those market controls.<br /><br />The combat campaign is unbalanced.  Several patches were released to fix bugs and that changed campaign play.  Some scenarios are a cakewalk, others impossible.  The hard campaign is relatively easy, while the easy and medium campaigns have stopping blocks.<br /><br />The economics campaign is also uneven, having an unfinished feeling to it.<br /><br />But, overall, the Stronghold series is well worth enjoying!"
848	-1	The only scary thing about this game is that its got such good reviews. Second rate modelling, lots of predictable and equalling annoying jump scares that make you want to uninstall it and forget it ever happened.
849	1	Save yourself time and go outside, don't play this kind of crap mmos are worse than drugs because they're socially acceptable
850	1	"About the Virtual Console Release of Metroid:  Before we get to the review proper, fortunately with the advent of the Wii's Virtual Console, for a mere five bucks you can have this piece of gaming history.  No hunting around for an old Nintendo, or going with a portable release.  Another great thing about the VC release is that if any time you are done with the game, you can simply go back to the Wii menu and suspend the game at whatever point you left it, and return at any time.  Don't have time to beat Kraid, Ridly, and Motherbrain but you don't want to lose your progress as you're quite far in? Just return to the Wii menu and it will automatically suspend!  For all the old NES games that's a great feature but especially for Metroid, where you don't have to deal with those cumbersome passwords anyway.  So, why be inconvenienced  when you want your Metroid fix?  Instead, simply get 500 Wii points, download to a Wii Channel, and wa-la, Metroid in all its original 8-bit Glory! What are you waiting for?  Buy it!    The Review Proper:  Samus's First Adventure is one of the all time greats.  This game, along with THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, defined open-ended exploration and is a true classic  In 1986, METROID forever changed the face of video gaming.  A richly atmospheric title, METROID offered a darker, grainier side to the bright images and sunshine gaming that were at that time populating Nintendo.  (To this day Nintendo still specialises in that `sunshine gaming,' with more titles for little kids than adults, but that's rather beside the point).  SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, the 8-Bit's flagship title, was colourful, woefully short, and a fun jaunt to rescue Princess Toadstool from the evil Bowser.  SUPER MARIO BROTHERS displayed a mastery of excellent level design, but it did not take long to beat.  The rest of the video games at that time, san ZELDA and KID ICARUS, were also of a relative simple nature.    Enter Samus Aran.  This was a game that offered unprecedented depth ofplay, was dark and grisly, and had great, mood setting music, and long, twisting corridors that led you deep into the Space Pirates' lair.  An incredibly large game for the time, comparable only to THE LEGEND OF ZELDA and KID ICARUS of the first generation Nintendo titles, you could wander around for hours, exploring and gaining access to new areas with new items.  I tend to think of KID ICARUS (why didn't this become a franchise???) and METROID as brothers, and ZELDA and METROID as first cousins.  While ZELDA offers a very innovative, opened-ended (for the time) overworld experience with fantasy elements, METROID does the same type of innovation for side-scrollers, with a map just as expansive (though in a different format) as ZELDA. Which brings me to the actual game play of METROID.  Metroid operates as one long map broke off into sections.  There is no level progressions like Mario.  But the game does contain you too certain areas that only opens up after you had receive new items.  These items are cleverly hidden throughout the game's map, and just when you think you've come to a dead end, suddenly you bomb the floor and a whole new area opens before you.  And the game isn't too kind when it set you down in that opening area of Brinstar.  Equipped with only 30 energy units, Samus has to be tough to survive.  Energy is scarce and can be time-consuming to collect. (Compare obtaining life in METROID to SUPER METROID; in SUPER METROID there's all sorts of energy).  The energy being so hard to collect, and the ungodly complex password system, do flaw the game, but we have to remember this is a first gen NES title, so you have to cut it some slack.    Now would be a good time to talk about METROID's glitch.  Much like the negative world in SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, METROID has one of the most famous glitches in the video gaming world.  Called the Secret Worlds, you use a wall jumping technique that enables you to get to \\""new areas\\"" of the game that are otherwise unreachable.  Thought to be a secret, an intentional programming easter egg, these Secret Worlds, while still fun to search for, are not intentional.  They are glitches.  Search the Internet to find out all about these secret areas.  After transversing Brinstar and Norfair, getting new items, then Samus has to fight through the two bosses' hideouts and put them down before the final confrontation: Mother Brain.  My favorite old school enemy, Mother Brain is a proven nemesis, much harder to beat than the laughably pathetic Bowser or even the more challenging Gannon.  On top of that, once you beat her you have to get out of Tourian within a certain time limit (admittedly, it's more than enough time to get out).  Even though Mother Brain's tough, we video gamers led Samus to victory countless times because of the stupendous game play and the compelling story.  Once Mother Brain is dead and we get Samus out of Tourian, then the real payoff is unleashed.  Samus is a WOMAN!  And if you beat the game under certain time limits, you get different endings.  During the days of rescuing damsels in distresses with a Brooklyn plumber or a green-clad boy, Samus's gender is very revolutionary, which brings me to the story aspect of METROID, which is currently under attack by ZERO MISSION.  METROID's best features are successfully combines rich story-telling (for the NES) with innovative gameplay.  This isn't a kid's game like Mario.  This is a classic science fiction story, heavily influenced by Ridley Scott's ALIEN.  Metroid is a story of a Space Federation fighting for its very survival against the fearsome Mother Brain and its two subordinates, Ridley and Kraid, who had stolen the Metroids and had their own devious designs for them.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the boss Ridley was named after Sigourney Weaver's character and Ridley Scott.  Gunpei Yokoi, executive produce of METROID (and also one of the chief developers of the original Game Boy), said that while ALIEN was never specifically discussed during Metroid's development, it cast a heavy shadow over METROID.  That same dark terror, about never knowing what was around the next corner and how you were hoping, against all odds, that Ridley in ALIEN and Samus in the game would come out on top, forever cemented both tales in the imaginations of their prospective audiences.   Because of the gameplay and atmospheric story, Samus Aran has become a classic video game icon.  Thankfully, after many long years the METROID franchise has become alive again with new releases.  But for those who want to relive the Samus's first glory, then this game would hold you enthralled.  This is truly a classic game.  P. S. Unfortunately, do to the relative simplicity of the NES version of events, Nintendo has saw fit to introduce a radical remake of the game on METROID: ZERO MISSION, enlarging it and changing around events.  While I enjoyed ZM, I felt it much to linear and went against what made the original so great to begin with: open-ended exploration.  See my METROID: ZERO MISSION review for more details."
851	-1	It took me 4 hrs to download the game and everything was going well till was time for my first &#34;Fifa 13 match&#34; was so excited and when I clicked &#34;Play match&#34; the game crashed and I thought &#34;hmm, Im sure is my computer&#34; but it turned out that the game it always crashes whenever i try to play any match. What a waste. Dont buy this game, buy an Xbox.
852	0	Addicting and fun while it lasted.  Wasn't too easy, but wished it had more levels to play.  Why do we have to leave a long review anyway?
853	1	Mass Effect 3 left you at the end wanting more for an ending.  They had better make a 4th one but it is hard to say with the ending they had.  You had three choices and all three sucked big time.  The Commander deserved better.  Some stupid AI Boy going to tell me how it ends forget that.  I want to tell him how it will end.  Well I need a fourth Mass Effect to save my disappointed ending.  This can't be the end to an Epic.  There will be none like this again for years to come.  I hope the creators see this and give us better closure.
854	0	It's more expensive than it is on the actual game website, but it's to my conscience I guess.
855	0	Classic games but too old.
856	0	As others have mentioned, this game does not seem to be well optimised to run on a Mac. I have a late 2013 iMac with 8GBs of RAM, a 2.7 Ghz 4-core processor, and Intel Iris Pro 1GB video memory. According to their requirements, I should be able to run it well. Even on low settings it lags quite a bit. Its not unplayable mind you, but I was expecting to at least be able to run it on medium settings without any hiccups.<br /><br />The small city size doesn't really bother me as it does others, but it is noticeable. Still, in the end it is a good game to play for many hours. I do wish I would have waited for a sale as $30 seems a bit high for a year old game that runs almost like a Playstation 2 title. I would recommend any who are thinking of getting this to really research before you purchase.
857	1	The game is just tons of fun.<br />Me and my niece play all day.<br />Watch out for the online code, thou.<br />The code is for only pc or mac.<br />Not a code to download it onto a ps4 or xbox one.<br />Learned the hard way.
858	1	Bought, got code, entered code, opened game, have coins and pet! I will be looking for many more of these
859	-1	This would never work for me, I couldn't get it to download to my Mac.
860	-1	DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!<br /><br />I recently switched to mac and since it didn't have a disc drive, I just bought the download... It won't even open for me. I want my money back for this! Its ridiculous!!
861	1	lol IT IS...I love how my Sims have more emphasis on their years with this game and it makes me really miss them when they're gone.
862	1	This has been a great addition to a fantastic game so far.  It's amazing to see what the right people can do for an MMO that was once considered dead.  This expansion has a lot of great action, and a pretty epic story arc to add on to what has been one of the best Final Fantasy's I have played in years.
863	1	two great games at an unbeatable price, the purchase can not miss in your library I need more deals like this. thanks amazon
864	-1	EA's customer support gave it one star. I have multiple issues associated with getting this game to run properly and technical support has only had me power cycle my route and reload the game despite me being able to play prior to a week of this problem. Dont get the dlc got to a store and buy it.
865	1	This game is very simple and fun.     PRO: The first few levels are the best becuase the weapons available at the time are different from each other and are useful in different situations. However, later on the earlier weapons become almost useless because of their low damage and/or firerate. Earlier levels really take advantage of the level design to create interesting encounters.     CON: The level design in later levels gets annoying and uninspired. The last two levels just throws a lot of enemies at you at once. Your only strategy in those levels seems to be kill faster than they can respawn or rush in and hope you don't die.    Overall, for $4.99 this is a great game. Great fun, but that goes down at later levels.
866	1	I only wish it had more levels.  It only took a couple of weeks to play all the way through.  Even after finishing it's still fun to replay levels though.  My four year old son loves it as well.  He is constantly asking me to play it so he can watch me.
867	0	But this is not the American Canasta game being played in many locations.  I will return it if possible.
868	1	I've purchased these cards elsewhere and it was a lot more difficult than Amazon. A transaction with Amazon goes easily and you'll have your online code in a couple minutes. Amazon also emails you a copy for your records. I recommend buying codes from Amazon. I advise not giving MS your credit card info... Buy these cards and use them.. it's much easier.
869	0	You know how most driving games are very much alike. Well it really didn't stop here. However for it's cost and how it plays on my desktop PC I am tickled!!
870	0	This game is okay for wasting an evening. You'll be sick of it after a few hours of gameplay, and will probably have beat it, but it's worth the few dollars it costs.
871	-1	you get what you pay for.
872	-1	I have Windows Vista and I am having the same problem as the previous reviewer.  I uninstalled and reinstalled, still get the hourglass briefly but the game will not open.  I am in contact with the company and hopefully this will be sorted out.
873	1	the best
874	0	The game concept is great. Execution is not so great. A number of significant glitches from its first release are still there. Game servers are replete with hackers. Punkbuster is a joke. Input lag will have you pulling your hair out.
875	1	Only bought this because it was cheaper to buy the ps3 code + ps4 upgrade than buying the ps4 version. Only tested the ps3 version an hour or so and then switched to ps4...
876	1	EA and Origin:<br />I didn't like this at first, but after a week of playing, this is quite an amazing application process. It provides better securities, and probes for better community, by allowing users to start their own platoons. The online VOIP and chat options are also a huge plus.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />Great gameplay. I didn't think that the gameplay was going to be that great at first, I mean, let's face it, it's an FPS, how unique can it be. But, I forgot how much action was actually in this game. I love the diversity of the Premium maps and game types. I also noticed that more people play on the Premium maps. I'm not sure if that's a plus for some people, but it is for me, as the two most popular types are Close Quarters, and the ticketed one, where I am still learning to play; it's very much like a capture-the-flag type of game. Anyway, there is no reason not to give this 5 stars, as it exceeds many of my expectations. And the graphics, well, to say the least, they very interactive, and amazing.<br /><br />While there are some clipping issues at times, every game has this.
877	1	I loved it
878	1	Amazing video game, as I expected!
879	-1	Awful. Do not buy, it's not worth the time or money. It's a completely frustrating experience. I purchased it as a SimCity fan thinking it couldn't be that bad, but it is.
880	0	This is one of those games that ends with &#34;To Be Continued&#34; -- personally I don't like that. Either the story is complete or it's not. I don't have a problem with sequels, just abrupt endings.
881	0	Map DLC packs are all the same to me unless the producers and graphics designers actually take the time to make them stellar, in which case they might as well make a brand new call of duty game. So I can't complain for 15 dollars. The new gun is decent, and gets as much play as any other weapon released with the game, so it definitely gets it's &#34;15 minutes&#34; of fame. It's just as I expected, nothing special. Just DLC.
882	-1	I purchased card now how do I use it. Am I waiting for shark code in email?
883	1	I found this game years ago for my DS. Love that it's now on my laptop!  It's a good game to pass the time. My 12 y/o daughter has been playing it too. She enjoys it a lot. She tried it when she was 10 on my hand held game consule She wasn't old enough to be patient with it. Fun game... not for those of you who enjoy arcade games. It's a game of searching and thinking.
884	1	Like it very much.. engaging!<br />There were some frame rate drops, now it seems to be gone. Either because of the update or i turned off headlight shadows. Everything else runs fine on max. setting<br /><br />Running i7 960, 2xGT560Ti SLI, 12GB 1600 MHz
885	1	I was able to add this to my Origin library by redeeming my code via the my account on the website.<br /><br />Good game also!
886	1	it is not as fun as the quest 2&3.  I love to challenge other people from around the world. it can be tough
887	0	Pretty decent entry; pacing is off at times, controls feel a bit sluggish, but it's the best RE experience you'll get outside of the re-remake for now.
888	1	My sister wanted this game and she might love the game cause she become addicted for a while for this game.
889	-1	Won't run. Don't buy digital downloads from Amazon. You must have a steam account of create one and then you must run it from Steam. Trying to return it for my money back.
890	0	Not the groundbreaking title everyone hoped for.  Has the potential, maybe with the sequel.  Gameplay and visuals are that of a top fps, the mobility is great; but there are too few mechs, guns, and human opponents to win me over from other fps mp.  And without a campaign, although this was announced pre release, it just feels like half a title.
891	-1	I could not download this because it said that a virus was detected. I tried to download several times. can I get another 6.99 game since I paid for this one??
892	1	i rate this item 5 stars because this my type of game not that im and everyday war games but on the low but we have to reach the colonel and his men
893	0	2 much of bugs
894	0	Everything in this game is, for the most part, likeable.  Typical Rockstar Games-type city to drive around in, etc., with the ability to drive any vehicle you want.  You play as Cole Phelps, a war veteran who works his way up from uniformed officer to traffic detective to homicide detective, etc.  The more successful you are as Phelps, the more &#34;ranking&#34; points you get.<br /><br />Two things I don't like: 1) fist fights using the XBOX controller for PC (it's difficult to figure out how to get the controls working and 2) the interrogations.  The latter dislike takes a good star or two off the game.  You ask a suspect something, then you have to determine whether he or she is lying (lie), hiding something (doubt) or being honest with you (truth).  It all seemed to work out until the Golden Butterfly homicide case.  Played it twice, got better info the second time, but got more interrogation questions wrong.  After that case, I deleted the game from my PC and went back to playing Torchlight II and Toy Soldiers, i.e. games that are more fun than frustrating.<br /><br />Nice try, Rockstar, but not nice enough.
895	1	I GOTTA THIS AT LAST
896	-1	They tried to compete with starcraft I'll stick to starcraft at least they spent more time doing animation that made it more interesting instead of hiring really bad actors but yeah some of the other games where quite interesting
897	-1	"I've played all the games in the SimCity series: Simcity Classic, Simcity 2000, Simcity 3000, Simcity 4, Simcity Societies, Simcity (2013).  The first 4 games were progressively better.  Societies was fail and the new Simcity makes Societies look like a great game.  I am not so much upset with the launch as I have played many MMO games that have had horrible launches as well.  I'm used to it.  However the game itself is a step backward compared to Simcity 4.  The graphics are not that much better especially from an aerial view.  Despite what many reviews and EA/Maxis might suggest, the city size is not comparable to a medium Simcity 4 map. It is in fact comparable to a Simcity 4 small map.  Part of what makes a good simulation game is the amount of time it takes to completely fill up the available space and then the time it takes to optimize everything you have in that space.  The new Simcity takes no more than 1 day to fill up the entire city map and have skyscrapers everywhere and make all the sims very happy and content.  This makes for a very boring experience and will result in players quitting the game very quickly.  Even despite the server launch problems, I was able to fill up an entire city map and optimize it to my liking in under 4 hours.  Also, no matter how EA and Maxis want to justify it, always online is not necessary for a simulation game.  It's a way to control the players and extract more money from them in the future by creating \\""pay only items and experiences\\"" within the game.  After a few years of Simcity 4, I started playing Cities XL 2011 and 2012.  I liked Simcity 4 more while i played it, but Cities XL had a better resource structure and had a more realistic interaction between landscape and city infrastructure.  The new Simcity is subpar compared to Cities XL.  I was expecting to go back to the Simcity series and stop playing Cities XL because Simcity has always been my favorite simulation game of all time.  But after a few days my only thoughts were \\""Cities XL is a much better game, with much more to do, and portrays a much more realistic scenario for city simulation.\\""  I'm sorry Simcity but if you can't do any better than this, then you've lost a diehard fan."
898	1	Great game never played 11 or 14 but it is amazing! Everything amazon did worked great in making sure i recieved my game in a timely fashion!
899	1	I ordered an online code and it went smooth. I ordered, got the code moments later. It redeemed flawlessly and I got to download some DLC in a matter of minutes. Very convenient.
900	-1	The game has no story and gives you no direction on how to accomplish the blasting in each level.  There is also very little to do in each level besides plant the explosives and detonate them.  No upgrades to buy better.  Nothing to work towards, besides the next blast.  If the game was closer to the usual $5-$10 price point of many downloadable games, it would be reasonable for what is in the game.  All that being said, there is a little enjoyment in bringing down a building, but not much.
901	0	i played better games super mario bro 3 and 1 is better ... i hardly ever play this game at all
902	0	The graphics are always nice, but this game and some of the other Sherlock Holmes games are a bit hard. Some puzzles you have to do seem to have no reason or no explanation how to get the answer to. I always use a walkthrough, but there are some places that I can do without, but this game like the others are a bit too difficult for me to do alone without a walkthrough giving hints and spoilers to the puzzles and the written quizzes you have to answer. It's a long game, but just little hard for me.
903	1	its is what is i received instantly and redeemed the code with no problems would buy again.
904	1	"If you like casual games you will love this game.  It's somewhat like Jewel Quest but with a twist.  Well, several twists.  The puzzles mostly look the same but the goals are different and it makes it fun and challenging.  I love that I can walk away from the computer and not worry about what's happening in my absence.  The computer patiently waits for my return.  I have a download version and it appears to have the option for multi-player gameplay, but that would take the \\""casual\\"" out of it so I've never tested it.      I've had this game for a long time and I keep going back to it.  I've never finished one character, and there are several (at least four) to choose from.  It's well worth the money!"
905	1	This game is worth every penny, don't be fooled by its kiddish exterior, it's a challenging, engaging and simply a blast. The sheer amount of content is staggering, top that off with free DLC updates from Popcap that introduces new game modes, characters and accessories and you have a game that was made and supported with love from the developers.    While the PC version does have its share of problems, the developers are frequently updating the game with patches to ensure an optimized experience. Overall, if you're a fan of multiplayer shooters, this game is definitely the most fun you can have at the moment.
906	1	My son is positively addicted to Sims 3. This is such a fun expansion. I have played it as well and it is so enjoyable. Definitely glad we made the purchase. Lots of underwater excitement to be found!
907	1	I won't bother getting into how much of a mess AC3 was, but this game more than makes up for it. AC4 fully embraces the potential of naval combat which could easily be the most addictive thing about the game, and it polishes the game play enough to make it a worthy successor to previous AC titles. Other mechanics such as hunting and crafting have also been refined to a level where they are actually meaningful who's was sorely lacking from the series. Edward is also a worthy spiritual successor to Ezio, and it didn't hurt to bring back a little bit of the charisma and swagger that we were used to from the AC2 trilogy.<br /><br />The only disappointing thing about this installment is that the focus of most of the game play lies in the naval segments. I understand that the devs wanted to play up the pirate theme, but it detracted from some of the land based elements that I miss from previous games. Future installments would also benefit from far fewer eavesdropping missions. Man are those tedious. The main story could also use a bit of work as well since I feel like the series is starting to stray away from the legacy of the early assassins a bit. Characters like Connor and Edward come around by the end of things, but getting there is something of a chore.<br /><br />Controls have been polished for the most part, and I can honestly say that many of the free running missteps I have faced have been my own fault, but the swimming is touchy. This is especially true during the diving bell sequences where accuracy is most vital. Other than that, this game has restored my faith in the franchise for the most part, and it takes away the sting that AC3 left behind. If the rest of the games are like this one, I would be happy with that. Heck, I might even consider buying the DLC for this game.
908	1	"I love this game! You will love this, too. It's fast, fun and you get to upgrade anything you like. Nikki is fun and wants the best Supermarket and you get to help her! I just downloaded Supermarket Mania 2!<br /><br />I only have 1 concern. I do not have children, but those of you who do the goals can be frusterating to a child. It says \\""you failed\\"" and your \\""normal\\"". I think it should say \\""try again\\"" and \\""good, great, expert.\\""<br /><br />Other than that I love the game and am telling you to purchase it!! It will keep you busy, it's fun and addictive."
909	0	Okay game
910	-1	This review is not for the game itself but a general lack of functionality of the download. Even on the lowest possible graphics rendering settings with a compatible graphics card, the game setup does not work. It replays the Viva Media logo over and over choppily without end, and although I'd love to see the game it wasn't loading. I'm dissappointed to have spent the money without the ability to refund my service since the game does not work. I've never downloaded a game through Viva Media before, and I don't plan to do so again.
911	1	Got the sick Zombies more, 4 new maps but DID NOT RECIEVE AN DLC WEAPON(AE4 Widowmaker) Couldn't find it anywhere. Taking away a point because of that
912	0	It's CoD. A good 6 hour SP campaign with some hit or miss gameplay. The same ole, same ole really. It has its moments though. I had fun with it.
913	1	Kids love this game and the price was perfect!
914	0	"What could have been fun and a great deal didn't work out in my situation, in spite of the fact that my configuration matches the \\""recommended\\"".  First, be prepared for a wait as you download these--it'll take a while. After the download is complete, it's easy enough to run the installer.  ME1 installer worked okay, but the game did not play.  After a couple of crashes Win7 suggested a link to EA, where an update was available.  Downloaded the update and that eliminated the startup crash.  The update was made available in mid-2009!!!! For Heavens Sake, can we expect digital downloads to be a little more current?  We'll see how it goes from here.<br /><br />No such luck with ME2.  The installer stops with a \\""Data Error\\"" which evidently is not an uncommon problem. After three hours of trying solution approaches discussed on the Bioware forum, no luck yet getting the install to work. Download 10.2 Gigs again? Amazon downloader evidently does not do a \\""data check\\"" to confirm a successful download--It requires that it all be done again from scratch.  Maybe this wasn't such a bargain.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I decided to download the ME2 a second time using Amazon Downloader (overnight).  The install went smoothly this time, so the problem was evidently a data integrity issue with the downloader/downloaded file.  Suggestions seem to indicate that the EA/Origin downloader is more reliable.  Something to keep in mind.  Review changed to three stars-one subtracted for the ME1 missing update issued 2009 but not included in the download here, one subtracted for the Amazon downloader reliability."
915	1	works great!
916	0	I downloaded the game not knowing exactly what to expect. The game-play is great (also enjoyed the story) however; the game is way too short, its comprised of two main stages, killing Vietnamese then aliens. It was about 20 hours of game-play at normal difficulty setting. When the game ended it was such a shock.
917	1	Great
918	0	needs to have more levels and be more challenging i wouldn't pay for it again. blah blah blah blah blah
919	0	After playing a pirated version online for some time, I fell obligated to the creators of this game to buy a copy. Hours of awesome gameplay guaranteed.
920	-1	Never got it to download very disappointed
921	-1	This game is actually fun for the price, but it will encourage you to vaccuum, wash the car, cut the lawn, etc.  It takes DAYS to get anywhere!
922	1	I played a demo of this very breifly quite some time ago and it caught my interest, so when it popped up on sale I got it.<br /><br />This isn't your mom's Alice in Wonderland lol....  Odd creatures, an almost bloodthursty but reluctant hero, and weird story makes this a very interesting game.<br /><br />Only complaint is the movement/camera control can feel a little &#34;wonky&#34; at times.  But other than that a real fun game to play when I'm not gaming online.
923	0	I only played about 3 hours, but the entire time I felt like I was just playing Call of duty but with robots instead of kill streaks. Limited maps, limited weapons and unlocks.<br /><br />Has some nice features like wall running and the like, but nothing that really stands out.
924	0	its ok<br />NFS has gone down hill since the first Most Wanted , my favorite was Need for Speed 2 Underground<br />this time around they went with Criterion Games which makes the Burnout games so I was kinda hopeful<br />not bad , just not great
925	1	Scary awesome. Love love loved it!!!
926	1	have
927	1	After my 5th play-though, I'm still passionate about this game. So naturally I will not miss any single DLC of this game.
928	0	"It's difficult to categorize this game- it is not adventure, not truly an RPG, and not entirely a simulation with the freedom level of most of the The Sims franchise for the PC. On one hand- it feels much more like a \\""real game\\"" than The Sims- this game features Hero Sims (which are the only characters you may control) completing steps of a quest while balancing daily tasks (such as writing laws, gathering supplies or paying taxes). The worst that happens with not completing daily tasks or going without a good night's sleep or quality meal is a penalty on your Hero's mood which impacts their chance of success at doing the next step of their quest. Still, it fails to challenge. You can't actually fail a quest unless you give up.<br /><br />There are a few bugs in the game- even after it's been out on the market for over a year. On one quest, my Hero Monarch couldn't leave the castle grounds, and I was forced to start the quest over again to make the bug go away. An annoyance is that the game does not auto-save after completing a quest, so even though a finish quest feels final, exiting without saving means you never did the quest.<br /><br />You yourself become a sort of character in the game, as the \\""Watcher\\"" a being revered by the religious sims in the game. You can unlock different Watcher Achievements, but unfortunately, one kingdom doesn't carry over to another overarching goal. Each kingdom needs its own sets of heroes, which gets repetitive quickly, as do the quests themselves. As with The Sims, doing things is clicking, and waiting for your sim to complete the task, and there's no skill needed on your part, no puzzle-solving or combat control.<br /><br />In short- this game is OK. Not great, perhaps worth a few hours or afternoons, but it's not something earth-shattering or fantastic. I'm glad I paid less than $7 when it was on sale."
929	0	I have a friend that sits and plays this game by the hour, she loves it, I got it because of her....
930	-1	I found the game very hard to complete, no help or hints. I have not played this game since I purchased it.
931	1	I mainly play Stereo 3d games when gaming on the PC. This one looks great in 3d. Inexpensive and a good experience as well.<br />No problems with the purchase or download.
932	0	Two days in and it either crashes within 5 mins, or it does nothing, not even able to get past the launcher.<br /><br />Edit:<br />A week later and most of the connection issues are gone, so I'm taking off a rating for the fact that this game is DRM protected. The possibility that you are at the mercy of the games servers to actually enjoy it sucks, especially after dealing with it for the whole first week. Outside of the server scope the game itself is super addictive, just like other SimCity games.<br /><br />Another hit goes for the mass transit and street construction. I was in a plot that only had port ability, no rail connecting to the rest of the region. I put my port down, all my streets upgraded to street cars with a full house of street cars, bus depot, regional bus terminal, the works. Still I had cars piled up on the highway in the region streching as far as the eye could see. In the city cars could not move, fire and police were stuck in jams. Many times they were stuck in traffic jams due to poor AI I believe because cars just would not turn the corner on the next street even though that street was clear.<br /><br />The street construction is a bit bugged. Say you draw a straight street and end it. Later on you decide to extend it. That extension looks normal, like it was extended into a normal stretch of road, but if you try to plop bus stops, street car stops, or try to draw a street from that point of extension, it says that it's an intersection, not allowing you to do any of these things.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this game is the small plot size they give you for your city. I think they should double the size at least. Once you have your city built up it looks silly in region view because there's nothing outside of the boundary, then bam a wall of towers in a tiny square. I would love to be able to spread my city out a little bit with dirty polluters way out off the side with my utilities by themselves, but you can't do that. In the end,your city is just a giant mound of buildings that just kind of meld together.<br /><br />Overall the game is fun, and I hope that since the game is forced online play that they will send out some updates giving us bigger plot sizes and better mass transit options.<br /><br />I do recommend the game, but just beware of these things.
933	1	Its to much fun play whit it it has an multiple details on every truck and the ambiance its magnificent for an middle space game 500mb
934	0	Loved this game on 360 so wanted to get it on pc, but disappointed to find out that there is no controller support.
935	-1	This would not work on my computer.  I am using Windows XP and Windows 7 and I am fairly proficient at installing programs and solving any problems.  I could not get it to run on my PC (Windows XP) or my new laptop (Windows 7).
936	-1	I need some help adding this camo to the game
937	0	The good: Very fun combat. Funny dialouge. Nice story.<br /><br />The bad: Buggy. The water and various other items looks messed up. The game completely freezes after death.<br /><br />I loved this game on xbox. I still can enjoy it on the PC. However, the annoying bugs can make the game a bit frustrating.
938	-1	They woud'nt give the after  I bought it, so I hadto wait 3hrs for the damn code to show on my account. Which is total BS.
939	1	Not Instant code delivery but still fast than other sellers, Coming buy again next time.
940	0	some stages in this game you will not be able to get,but still fun.Think maybe a problem with the down load.
941	0	not the best game.
942	0	If you like running around in a nicely rendered world with pretty good controls and ease of use, rejoice.<br />If you like talking to interesting characters and having adventures... the controls are good and the lack of a defined linear path means you'll probably wander into an area with enemies you can't kill so have to just run back.<br /><br />Gameplay just came out better than the story. Some interesting ideas but too much nothing between story parts.
943	1	Good balance, good character, good animation, awesome music and ... very difficult story.<br />Desperately awaits Choronophatasma and New Guilty Gear!!
944	0	First of all, let me speak to the installation of the game.  *After* everything was downloaded it took several hours before I could actually play Dragon Age Origins at all.  It took several additional days before I could play the DLC that comes with this package.  Eventually I found out I had to manually patch to version 1.05 (or higher presumably) in order to get the DLC to work.  This is also supposed to fix the crashing bug I was experiencing.<br /><br />There is nothing in the game or on Bioware's website that directed me to this solution.  I eventually browsed the DAO forums and found a link to the EA support site (NOT the Bioware support site which the game directs you to).  The efficient EA tech support patiently helped me resolve the issue.  But all told this was the worst installation I have experienced since the world wide web was born.<br /><br />As for the game itself ... it was ok.  The controls and gameplay are good enough.  The story is darker and more predictable than I would wish.  There are no shocks and no real chance at heroism or villainy as you might find in other Bioware titles.  It is very much Baldur's Gate 3 but replacing the humor with bloody choices where every success is tinged with failure.  In this way it was too much like covering real life in blood and shoving a few demons in.
945	0	Way better if you're playing coop with your friend; just missing around and not taking it serious at all. It's a lot of fun.
946	0	OK, I am editing my original review, as the game appears playable now. At least over the past 2 days...<br /><br />It is a fun game! But it is a little buggy. It has not crashed at all, but there have been some bugs, such as:<br /><br />(1) When the giant fire-breathing lizard attacked my city and was eventually killed, the fire he was breathing remained, locked in one spot... it was just coming at an angle out of the sky.<br /><br />(2) Some of the bars on the various graphs go outside of the pop-up window that they should be in.<br /><br />(3) I have a large arena, and it kept saying it was not powered when it was. I have to bulldoze it and rebuild it to get it to recognize it was powered.<br /><br />So none of those are showstoppers, and I am sure they will get it fixed.<br /><br />At this point, my biggest complaint is the size of the city... I run out of room WAY too quickly. And sure, you can open another region but you are basically starting over when you do that.... the city needs to be at least 4 times bigger then the current size... if not more.
947	1	Fast easy Digital Delivery. Always great when there is No gaming down time! This is definitely a great deal that I will purchase again when it is time.
948	1	I love this game it has been fun for the whole house my kids and the adults recummend this instead of letting your children be on facebook or my space
949	-1	When I can play its your average 1P shooter! But the wait time for a game is ridiculous! Waited over an hour for a match on a 12mb line! Buddy has an 8mb line and goes straight in! Keeps disconnecting me with an error! Have no problem with any other game! This is going back on the shelf... Not the first time they have gotten a launch so very wrong... Done with the franchise!
950	1	Probably one of the best Bang for your Buck bundles. These games are all fairly new, and and do require a someone decent internet speed to download. (If not DL it overnight)
951	0	First, let me say I am not a professional or even avid video gamer. I'm an older guy who likes to play FPS since Wolfenstein (the original) came out for relaxation.  I don't have a gamer PC. But it is dual core, have plenty of PAM and a game card. So it is adequate, I guess.<br /><br />This has a good story line, fair graphics and would be a great game of a modern gamers box. As it was, it was just barely playable on mine. there were lags, starts and stops, and I guess it was my fault buying a PC game when obviously you need a very modern state of the art, overclocked 8 GB RAM box to play these things.<br /><br />I also didn't like the forced membership with Origin. Why do I have to join that when I never play on line???<br /><br />So, the best I can give it is a 3. If you like playing ion line, have a super-fast connection and state-of-the-art box, it will be great.
952	1	One of the best games ever done, I'm playing massively and I can't stop! Recommend it! I think that this game is one of the best games I've played, next only the Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, Metal Gear series, GTA and Final Fantasy. I know, they are different games, so let's compare with StarCraft and Warcraft. I miss only a campaign mode, but it's very good yet.
953	0	"Tera is an action MMORPG, where auto attacking and tab targeting have been removed in favor of a much more fluid (and interesting) combat system. The game plays very much like your standard action game, and defeating enemies requires dodging, blocking, and being mobile. While you must still use a hotbar to trigger abilities, all of them have to be AIMED by you, and can be dodged just as easily by another skilled player (not by monsters, who have terrible, terrible AI). This results in some of the best PvP action I have ever encountered.<br /><br />All is not well however, as the game has quite a few broken quests at this very moment. They recently merged all their servers into just three (the PvP only Mount Tyrannas, the PvE only Tempest Reach, and the Roleplaying server Celestial Hills). This merge created a myriad of problems and broken quests for the team at Enmasse Studios. I tried playing a freshly made toon just for the purpose of this review and found that I could not progress through the prologue because of a quest glitch. Moreover, skipping the prologue and going to the newby area, I was again halted by a quest MOB not spawning - and this once more prevented progression. There were about 20 people trying to finish this story quest (you NEED to complete them), and swearing about the game being a bug filled mess.<br />Logging on with my higher level characters, I was told there were quite a few more bugs in game after the merge (I asked in guild chat), and a lot of them impede progression.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- Tera is incredibly gorgeous on the highest settings, of course you need a beefy computer to run it. My TimelineU M5-481TG-6814 can't handle it on medium or above, while running games like Skyrim on the high settings.<br /><br />- The combat is amazing. I love that auto attack and targeting has been removed. This is by far the best combat in any MMORPG that I have played, and I played a lot of them. The thrill you get from dynamically dodging or blocking (and countering) your opponent's attack adds a lot to the overall feel of things.<br /><br />- Environments and creature design are outstanding. Whoever created the world of Tera should be praised for a job well done. Everything from lush, rolling landscapes, to the mobs and races that inhabit it are all top notch. My only complaint about the races, is that all the females look like slutty supermodels (or borderline illegal for the Elin race).<br /><br />- There are lots of ways to customize your characters (however there are also some limitations - such as not being able to make a purely bald character).<br /><br />- Interesting progression system where you glyph your skills to modify them (there are usually quite a few choices to pick from), and lots of ways to improve your gear (crystals, enchantments, etc).<br /><br />- Fighting BAM's (big ass monsters) is incredibly fun (and they live up to their name). Killing a BAM is like hunting similar creatures in the excellent Monster Hunter games, but a bit more challenging. For all you MH fans out there, do yourself a favor and roll a Berserker - that way you should be able to solo most BAM's. That is my main, and the only character that I can solo most BAM's with (adding to the MH feel).<br /><br />- Server merges make for incredibly populated servers. There are countless players running and fighting all around you.<br /><br />- The world PvP is pretty good, and actually exists in Tera, as does GvG (Guild VS Guild) and Battlegrounds.<br /><br />- You can play for free, just like in Eve by purchasing a Chronoscrolls for in game money. You can also buy one from Amazon and sell it for in game funds. I haven't payed for Tera ever since this system was introduced a while back.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- There are generally only three quest types in Tera (of the fetch, escort, and slay variety). All MMORPG vets are familiar with these \\""staples\\"" of the genre. Eventually PQ's do make an appearance, but bythat time it is already too late.<br />With the evolution that [[ASIN:B007VTVKG6 The Secret World]] has brought to the genre, playing Tera (or any other MMORPG for that matter just feels stale).<br /><br />- Plenty of broken quests after the server merge.<br /><br />- Grinding, grinding, and did I mention grinding? The best way to level up is still to repeat grind quests in key areas while queuing for dungeons. There is a huge drop off in the leveling speed at 40, and then again at 50. Getting up to 40 however is pretty simple.<br /><br />- The game does not deserve its M rating. It simply doesn't push the boundaries like [[ASIN:B000RZPW9W Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures]] or make you think like [[ASIN:B007VTVKG6 The Secret World]]. Other than the nude patches that are floating around the net, there is nothing too inappropriate in Tera. When a game is rated M, I expect it to handle that rating with more than just skimpy dresses.<br /><br />- Tera's story is absolute generic garbage. Everything from the poorly voiced cutscenes to the terrible text. I tried to read the whole thing my first time through, but eventually succumbed to the ultra fast \\""accept quest and move on\\"" mode. [[ASIN:B001CWXAP2 Star Wars: The Old Republic]] and [[ASIN:B007VTVKG6 The Secret World]] really handle this a LOT better. This is disappointing since I actually loved the Tera books.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />- Tera is dying. Unless they switch to F2P post haste, I am afraid that even the three current servers will not fill up. My guild, which consisted of hundreds of members months ago, is now down to 17-20 active ones. The merges helped quite a bit, but I don't know for how long.<br /><br />- The AI of some MOBs in this game is unbelievably laughable and makes the monsters in WoW seem like brain surgeons. You can exploit terrain and class skills to no end when it comes to certain encounters.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />At the current price of $9.99 (for TWO copies), it would be a mistake to not try this game out. It comes with 30 days of playtime, and if you do everything right it should be the only money you will need to spend (just purchase Chronoscrolls for in game cash).<br /><br />I liked Tera at first, I really did but as time progresses and I experienced other games, I couldn't help but give the game a three star rating. If you have never played an AMMORPG before, feel free to add an extra star to my review, but with the competition being what it is - I can't recommend this game too much. In fact, if it wasn't for my addiction hunting BAM's and world bosses, I would have probably completely moved on by now."
954	-1	Would review this game but thats not my problem here. I've now downloaded this game 4 times and the game never even loads. Nothing happens. So yea this version of the game is broke and refuses to play.
955	1	Instant code.
956	-1	This game does not work properly with my  mouse. I have tried adjusting the mouse settings and used a different mousse as well. The cursor drifts which makes it difficult to choose tiles with any kind of speed and accuracy. The game is designed so that you can't move to further games if you don't have enough points on the previous one. There is no untimed option. With the mouse not responding it is unlikely I will ever get beyond the first level.
957	0	I paid very little for this game, part of the summer sale , and I got what I paid for. Graphics were simple, game was predictable and I only played it once .
958	1	This game was better than I expected. I am using keyboard, but controler on the way so it will be even better. No complaints, no glitches. Game runs great windows 7 64.
959	-1	I found this game to be extremely disappointing, especially compared to Skyrim, Oblivion, and the Fallout series.  I don't find the multiplayer aspect at all interesting, and the online discussions within the game seem rather pointless.  As far as I can tell, none of the scenarios are leveled, and if you don't &#34;get&#34; the storyline, you will likely wander off into other quests that are too difficult, or way too easy, for your character to deal with.  It doesn't have the feeling of an adventure quest as much as it has the feeling of being a treasure hunt cooked up by &#34;creative&#34; parents for a ten year old's birthday party.  Comparing this to other Bethesda games, I would say that it has all of the bugs, but little of the cool.  Not recommended.
960	-1	Since I've been charged for this product, I feel I should be able to review my experience.  I can't download what I've been charged for.  I called Amazon support and David was great explaining that the issue and weird error code was with Steam.  He directed me to the Steam website where I created an account.<br /><br />Now when Steam launches there is no text on the buttons.  I tried to get support from Steam and am still waiting.  Amazon has my money.  Steam is a real steamer.<br /><br />Amazon: please drop Steam--they are giving you a bad name.<br /><br />Update: after almost 24 hours after creating a ticket with Steam I've yet to get a response.<br /><br />Update: 5 days after opening a ticket with Steam I have yet to receive ANY support.  I've spent about 6 hours trying to fix the issue given their limited documentation.  I really wanted to play this game.  I preordered it.  Amazon doesn't offer it on disk.  Steam wont support their service.  I don't get to play this game.<br /><br />I got a refund and am done with it.<br /><br />Got hours to spare trying to get what you paid for?  Give Steam a shot!<br /><br />Amazon was extremely helpful with this, but can't make steam support their product.
961	0	Need more American  fright cars and trains and it  pain- in the ass for making routes
962	0	as expected
963	1	It's a great game, really fun. One of the best games in his category, really good game for PS4. :)
964	0	Gotta pay to play online I guess. Do I like paying for it? No. But at least they give you some games, although somewhat old games, to go with your membership. What I really dislike is the requirement to have Gold just to use services I've already paid a subscription for like Netflix, Amazon Instant Video or Vudu. Frankly, services like that should not be behind another paywall.
965	-1	The concept of the Gold Membership required to access basic functionality seems absurd.<br /><br />This 12 month membership comes with 3 free games...  but only for Xbox 360 - NOT for Xbox ONE; although this was marketed along with Xbox ONE.  Disappointed that they bate you to get this with the offer of 3 free games that you cannot use.
966	1	I have purchased great games with psplus discounts and i havent spend more than $60 on all ten combined, (This includes GTAIV, God Of War Ascension, Tomb Raider 2013, RE6, $5 bioshock 2) This memebership is paying itself just for the discounts and to make it better they give you free monthly games to keep you busy.<br /><br />I dont have a  vita nor a PS4 but i already got free games for this systems thanks to the membership.<br /><br />If you dont mind not having physical discs then this is a must have membership for the playstation family
967	0	This game had a lot of challenges.  Mainly because your next step was not very intuitive. For instance the locker combo issue several reviewers have mentioned.  You actually get the clue for the number in advance, but the usage of the clue is very vague.  There was a lot of walking from location to location.  A map would have been helpful.  The overall environment was dark, but not in a good way.  More dark and dingy, instead of dark and creepy.  The mini games were fun. Several types I had not seen before.  The game did seem long, which was good.  Too many of these games are over way too soon. Overall, it was worth the 1.99 I paid for it.  But I have played better from Alawar.
968	0	Yeah, I thought I was going to enjoy this until I found out that this is merely an add-on and not a separate game. They really do need to put that in the description. I don't know if this game actual is horrid. However I seen the game play an knows that it is really short. I plan on buying the game AFTER I already spent a dollar on this one. lol It's not too much of a problem because it was only a dollar and some change but, they do need to add that to the discription because I am sure, that I'm not the only one who made the same mistake. Hopefully, this review will help other people from making it. ALSO, YOU NEED THE DOWNLOAD OF THE ACTUAL GAME, NOT THE CD-ROM.
969	1	Good game, nice world, epic jumps, if you want to play a diferent way of the third person shoort or action/adventure game, Jst Cause 2 its the choice
970	1	Worked perfectly, easy to redeem.
971	1	New missions and Great Price!
972	0	This is a great game, but it it's extremely short. It doesn't really add anything to the overall experience of TLOU. Unless you have 15 bucks burning a hole in your pocket or are a huge fan of the franchise, I'd pass on this one.
973	1	Wow,It's 7.5 bucks for 2 great games,can't wait buying this!<br />And don't miss this time, cuz tomorrow it will be 10$.
974	0	Cross bow is really nice with cool unlock trees, but the maps are terrible. They're too wrecked to provide any real nice gun play, and the character damage has been changed to make you more delicate. The other various modes that come along with this are tripe, so don't bother, just get premium or skip this pack.
975	0	I was bored at work so I downloaded the game and played it to kill some time.  The gameshow host (dressed in white with poof of blond hair)is rather annoying and the game is not anything new.  I prefer Cooking Dash to Hot Dog Hotshot.  I didn't find the graphics all that great and yes I know they are suppose to look that cartoony way.  Also, I found the upgrades rather limiting.  You start out only making hotdogs; however, you can eventually get hamburgers.  Aside from some various toppings like mushrooms, oninions and eggs...there's not much in the way of new stuff to prepare and the mushrooms, eggs, oninions are only put in a pan until ready then placed on the burger/hotdog.  You do get onionrings and fries and three beverages to serve.  The beverages are already made drinks in bottles.
976	0	It's an fun game, but it's a must to play this with a controller.<br /><br />The problems with mouse & keyboard:<br /><br />1. V-Sync Causes mouse lag (actually any framerate under 100fps cause mouse lag)- without v-sync you get good ol' screen tearing.<br />2. There is keyboard lag, which can only be fixed by downloading the unofficial deadisland config tool, or shutting off repeat keys every time you play.<br />3. Auto aim cannot be shut off, if you can stomach the screen tearing or mouse lag, you still have to deal with very sensitive auto aim which is no fun when using a mouse.<br />4. Mouse sensitivity in menus differs from ingame - can only be fixed by the unofficial config tool.<br />5. Sometimes mouse sensitivity ingame will randomly decrease very low when looking at the sky then looking back down, or looking at certain areas indoor (very noticeable in the indoor hotel area)<br />6. Picking up certain things will automatically unequip your current weapon and next time you attack, alcohol will be had instead, messing you up for a while.<br /><br />General standard PC game option missing.<br /><br />1. Can't turn off bloom (which is blindingly bright)<br />2. Can't turn off motion blur<br />3. No antialising options<br />4. No anisotropic Filtering options<br /><br />If you purchase this game be aware that you NEED to download the Unofficial DeadIsland Config tool and you MUST play with a controller.<br />This game truly is the worst PC port ever made.
977	0	I really enjoyed the hidden object portion of this game, pretty challenging and it stayed interesting, however, I found the mini games difficult and not fun to play.  They were all lining up squares or tetris type games and I generally prefer a bigger variety in my mini games.  You can skip them, but you lose your hints for the next screen!
978	0	It's a nice game and I like it,but if it's left on pause,it stops and I have to restart computer.Not good.
979	-1	I love most Alawar games, but these, aside from being rather juvenile, just did not work. I would get part way into a game and then it would quit working and there would be nothing that I could do to finish it. It is a bundle of a bunch of games and I tried about 4 and really could only complete 1. I just gave up on the rest and deleted it off my computer.
980	-1	I CAN NOT BUY THE GAME I got the X BOX gift card code 60$ but when I try to buy a game that costs 59.99$ I got the message HOW DO YOU WANT TO PAY THE REST ? THE REMAINDER OF YOUR PURCHASE NEEDS TO GO ON A DIFFERENT PAYMENT OPTION  Send me 10 GIFT CARD OR I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS on my Microsoft account still hangs 60$ and I can not spend it!!!!!!!!!!!WTF
981	0	First impression is okay just not great.<br />Anyone wishing for something more akin to EU III will be dissappointed<br />Anyone looking for a &#34;stand alone&#34; board game elcgtronizised will like this alot<br />Some good features but very little diplomatic wiggle room. Very little room for<br />different goals being realized long-tgerm.<br />Great combat system.<br />Yu choice what you like best feature-wise and decide for yourself.
982	0	I like the game just fine, but it gets &#34;hung up&#34; every time  I replayed it. Gave up.  I have other Samantha Swift games on Cd. The &#34;hard copy&#34; games didn't get hung up like that.
983	0	Does not install, but did not want to give it a bad review based on that, since for others that it successfully installed, I am sure they love it!
984	0	I read reviews for this one before buying on a deal. I like me some strategy games but this one was nothing new. Same old stuff with newer graphics and a couple of features.
985	1	This was for my grandson that comes to my house after school. He loves it and play for hours. His friends play with him sometimes.
986	0	I have been a Joust fan for decades, I wasted countless quarters in the original machine and have bought virtually every adaptation I could over the years.<br /><br />I was a smidge disappointed in the Xbox360 port - the controls seem a little bit sluggish, which is kind of surprising given the original vintage of the game and the hardware it ran on.<br /><br />It's not horrible, it's just that sometimes I feel like there's too much delay between when the button is pressed and the wings flap, which is a critical disadvantage in this game.<br /><br />We plan to buy an inexpensive 'retro' joystick for the 360, and we're hoping that will fix some of the control issues, but this is still a winner and worth the pittance it costs to get on your machine!
987	-1	I own the game before, this seems like a generic version of the game. I found the actual version somewhere else. This was I'm sorry to say, a waste of money.
988	0	I'm the wrong person to review this only because I'm burned out on the genre. The game is nice as far as I played, but it wasn't much.
989	-1	If you are like me and bought Civ 5 through the App store then this will not work as Amazon says it will. You will be given an access code then have to download the Steam software which would supposedly give you the update but unfortunately if you didn't buy the game through Steam you are unable to proceed any further, unless you want to purchase the game again. Great heads up, Amazon!
990	1	Some things I love, There is plenty of content to delve right into and a handful of endgame events. The game looks absolutely gorgeous. The story isn't half bad (still a little long for my liking). Each Class brings something fresh that feels different from the rest. Pet jobs aren't completely atrocious like other titles (still needs some work). Healing and Tanking are actually fun to an extent. To summarize my review for the tl;dr. Very enjoyable title, pick it up and you won't be disappointed, but you'll be pining for just a little bit more right now. If you want to wait, next year it should be a 5 star title worth anyone's time, but for fans of both Final Fantasy or MMOs, it's truly a gem worth discovering right now.<br /><br />What I think needs some more work still:<br />1. Optimizations (64bit and DX11 both of which are being worked on now)<br />2. Some minor bugs that are more so annoying than game breaking<br />3.Duty Finder (basically Raid finder) needs some adjustments such as in if someone withdraws X amount of times to lock them out for a period (maybe an hour).<br />Website for paying subscription is mostly streamlined, although they could simplify it a bit<br />4. Pet AI needs some love. They aren't completely stupid but there are some things like AOE buffs that are just triggered without thought just cause of enemy engagement. The big one being I'd love to put my healing pet on 1 party member to take care of them while I concentrate on rest of the party.<br />5. Disciples of Land (mining, botany, fishing) only have really 3 ways to gain exp, spamming leves (small quests you can undertake) or quests (only ones I know you can do are ones that your guild gives you unless you can do ones with no monster fights but they aren't particularly specified soooo) or the good old fashioned spam harvesting which compared to Fighting classes you can spam World events called Fates, You can spam Duties (dungeons) and do daily roulettes for tons of EXP (most dungeons are 700-1500 exp per monster and the roulette is anywhere from 70K to 140K exp) Leves (which are shared so if you use them for your melee/mage you can't use them for your Fieldcrafts or Crafting Classes) which is in a way a pit making you choose to grind them or not use them just for your Crafting/Harvesting classes. Need to implament Fates for those other Disciples to balance things out.<br />6. End game is pretty limited and right now because of balance people are constantly shouting that you must have cleared the content to be considered to join them to clear the content. A catch 22 putting you in the position of doing a group yourself or not doing it at all.<br />7. The Economy is fragile at best. Most crafting is near useless except for a small handful of things that sell consistently, but that is a by product of a new economy without many money sinks for people. When personal housing and more gear to craft comes out it'll create a more stable economy for crafters.<br />8. Unlocking certain content is sometimes a guessing game or a google search game, would be nice if the recommendations list came up with content able to be unlocked such as Dungeons you can get from NPCs.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />Have not tried PVP at all<br />Social aspects in the game are very limited. Not enough incentive to group and maintain relationships with other players.<br />Well balanced difficulty until a certain point which is when you encounter a level 35 boss fight where it slaps you in the face hard and the curve only gets worse until about 50 where it levels off.<br />Every class has a job which brings it more skills, except 1 Class Arcanist has 2 jobs which allow it to go healer or dps and the issues it faces are that you get 30 stat points to place as you level and missing those for DPS or Healer in some ways makes or breaks you in certain situations. I'm afraid to see what will happen when other classes receive a second job. In some ways it limits you effectively to pick or choose, but maybe this is intended.<br />Did I mention the world is gorgeous, varied and absolutely enchanting? The music is A+ top notch and the world is very well crafted and thought out. Always a nook and cranny to see and tons of long drops to jump off of to your doom.
991	0	It's really entertaining specially for kids, as most lego games it has a neat and heasy way to play multiplayer during the campaing.
992	-1	I bought this game direct from Steam &#34;on sale&#34; for $38.  There is a chapter/mission called Barksdale that crashes before it finishes loading, and this is about a bit over halfway into the game.  I am running Windows XP, and the game is supposed to be XP compatible.  Steam refused to refund the purchase and only after getting American Express involved was the chargeback done.  But in retaliation Steam suspended my Steam account for 9 weeks.  I notice that even though this is on Amazon, the digital rights management is still via Steam.  Buyer beware.  Otherwise it is a fun game but given the difficulty of lack of support from both Steam and Activision (not one of their current games, so no technical support), wait until the price drops to $5.00, and then it's worth buying just in case it doesn't work on your system, and at most you'll lose $5.
993	-1	I never got the code. I got debited
994	0	There are many methods to pay the burden... I don't like paying at all. Other places offer cheaper prices so this was stupid on-top-of bad.
995	1	I love this game.  It's a bit basic, but it sucks you right in!  I wish there was a mode between regular and hardcore.  I haven't had the chance to try out two player yet, but I hear that's good too.  Well worth the money.
996	1	square-enix is doing very good job on the game, easy to play, lots of things you can do in the game.<br />like all other online games, you need to spend time on it
997	0	we can't do porn with this DLC but we can make them follow us and shoot stuff. I also call my penis &#34;Tommy&#34; like the gun, so i can shoot stuff with both guns with that too.
998	1	I love this game! It is really fun to play and very addicting! I'll start out my day with my coffee and playing this game. It has many different layouts plus you can create custom ones too. I wish this game was offered on my ipad and itouch! Once you try this mahjong game you will love it! :)
999	0	the game was alright crysis warhead is alot better tho
1000	-1	couldn't download
1001	0	Fun game to play online, however for the occasional gamer like myself it seems to take forever to rank up in order to &#34;unlock&#34; newer guns and accessories. I also don't really like how I have to use my web browser to log into the game.
1002	1	Excelent
1003	1	Great game, great distribution method, quite satisfied in all ways possible.  The replay value is great, and you'll love the online features.
1004	-1	I don't like the fact that you have to go to two other websites to download the games. The 3rd game I put in the code and that was it. It didn't inform me on what the next step was to install.<br /><br />The tech support takes forever to respond!<br /><br />I can't just open the games from my dashboard either. I have to screw around with the origin website in order to do so.<br /><br />If this is how the 4th game is going to be I don't want it.  I've played this game since the 1st version but if they are really going to make it this complex to play a simple video game they just lost a customer.
1005	0	ok
1006	0	This is not a game but addons. You will need to buy the game first. The game it self is actually pretty cool.
1007	0	Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #4,807 in Video Games<br /><br />There are at least 4,806 games that you should be playing instead of this. It's not terrible, it just won't be in your top 10 for very long. Stealth gameplay, a little repetitive, original story.<br /><br />Wait until this is $4 or $5 on Steam.
1008	0	Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.<br />Do compare to similar products and share how long you've used this product.<br />Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort & fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.<br />Don't describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback).<br />Don't include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.
1009	-1	I did not like this game,it insists that i have to use a stick and i play on a gaming computer,the graphics are great as far as i can see but as i could not use my mouse and keyboard i did not see much,at steam i have looking for a friend that might want the game and give it to them,so far no takers.
1010	1	I personally disagree with the previous negative review. The game itself, while on consoles and pc, does not feel like a complete port to me.  I enjoy the fluid fighting, and feel like this is a huge step above and beyond the original game in all aspects.  With option dungeons giving about 60 hours of gameplay (I have a ways to go :P), and all of the random loot that is dropped in the game (I found 7 or 8 items JUST in the tutorial), this game is excellent.  The soundtrack is AMAZING, and this is a soundtrack that I would come close to comparing to Bethesda titles (I'm a big fan of their music too).  The story, while not for everyone, is a continuation of the original darksiders with the next of the four horsemen taking the reigns, and death not only adds his own personality, but allows for a deep story line and a completely different combat experience than his slower brother, war (from darksiders 1)<br /><br />Great game, and now I need to get back to playing some more :)
1011	-1	I have Windows 7.  Changed compatibility under icon properties, tried to down load a patch.  Nothing so far has worked.<br />I have played this game in the past and it was fun.<br /><br />If you don't have Windows Vista, I don't know that I would try to down load it.  Waste of time.
1012	1	All good
1013	1	Although the graphics are a tiny bit glitchy at times (not during the actual game but during things like the prologue) I didn't have problems downloading this game on my mac. My mac's specifications aren't anything special either. I haven't updated to mavericks or yosemite either so that also could be the reason this game still works.
1014	0	I have been playing HOG for awhile, and I find the items in this HOG are very small and quite difficult to locate. Haven't played it again.
1015	0	Although this is game is about hidden objects it has some things I didn't like.  I didn't like that you never knew what mode you would be looking for the hidden objects.  Also I didn't like that there was no relaxed mode.
1016	-1	Please a solution for this problem.. I paid NBA 2K14 PS4 (Digital Code).. I have received NBA 2K14 PS3 (Digital Code)..<br />In fact is very simple and fair, If Amazon can't send us a new code to redeem for NBA 2K14 PS4, at least give us a money refund.
1017	0	The game is great but having to get set up with the online gaming server and the stream account was not an efficient process.
1018	1	Its xbox live, better than Playstation
1019	1	best  fatal frame  series  ever  i played  this  game on ps2  , And I liked to return to the past and retrieve memories that I have been through with  game, especially as the price is very simple,  hzd admitted that the game is transferred to the PlayStation 3, but the game experience worthy of gamers and Ghost tension
1020	1	Great product highly recommended<br />Fast<br />easy<br />and the lower price is the best<br />works and the best part you can reemdem the same moment
1021	1	This is by far, the best way to purchase microsoft points. Tax free, fast, no credit card on file with microsoft.
1022	-1	the code it is incorrect
1023	1	Fun game.  The devs have made the game center around a main storyline/quest line, which is neat.  The character system is excellent - 1 character can play all classes. Dungeons are standard Rift/WoW type 'plow through' things. Trials are nice touch, where you focus on a single boss.  I still wish these games had a more Everquest 1 style combat, where you pull/kill 1 mob at a time.  The constant movement in the dungeons kills your ability to have a good chat (keyboard based).  Also the game is much like Rift/WoW/Tera where the ground lights up and you move. Simon-Says, blah blah.  This is challenging, but it gets repetitious. Dungeons/Trials also seem to use a global que that spans all servers in a datacenter, which is a nice touch. Que times seem to be about 5-20 minutes.<br /><br />The storyline / class system define this game. The story is FF style and has an epic feel, a welcome change from Rift and Tera where the story seems to be a tossed in hack.  The game also seems stable, after 3-4 weeks of play, I have not experienced any bugs or weird stuff.  The devs also discourage parsing/public shaming, which makes dungeons a little less stressful.  In Rift, it is fairly standard for groups to request DPS with  &#62; XX kdps or 'only purple' gear. That said, Rift's mentor system is excellent, and FFXIV could learn from it. In FFXIV, you can be leveled down, but it is automatic process for certain events (dungeons and special group content called Fates - kinda like a 'rift' in Rift).  Unfortunately, you can not manually level yourself down, this is unfortunate, as it makes doing low level quests boring if you out-level the area.
1024	1	It is there for when you need it for movies games and game add ons
1025	0	this game is exactly like chocolate factory but it has a glitch. halfway through, despite the fact that you have done all things necessary to complete your impending quest, it won't let you move on. you are stuck halfway through the game. no matter how many times you reinstall or replay, when it gets to a certain task, you are done.
1026	1	I bought this pack to have the Civ IV and Civ V games.  I haven't played the X-Com game so this review is about the other two.  My daughter and I love to do &#34;building&#34; type of games and since she lives far away, we especially love to do the online ones.  I am thoroughly enjoying Civ IV Beyond the Sword which incorporates the original Civ IV game and all updates.  I have to say it is quite challenging to learn - be prepared for lots of reading!  But, that is part of the fun, too.  I also like that, if I ever get skilled and brave enough, I can bump myself up to another level of difficulty to make the game more challenging.  (I am not there yet, though.)  Civ V, is quite different from IV, but also has many of the same features.  The tutorials were helpful, but what really helped is that I had already played Civ IV for awhile.  The manuals for the game are huge - but are helpful, if you take the time to read them.<br /><br />I find the Civ games quite challenging, fun, frustrating, intriguing, time consuming, and very difficult to stop playing once I start.  I didn't give them a 5 star rating because although I really, really like the games, I am not sure I love them.  I would definitely recommend them to gamers who like challenges and games where you build things, with some warring thrown in if you want!
1027	-1	my antivirus on my computer found a virus on this game , I should get my money back.\<br />it would not download , so I wasted seven dollars .
1028	1	Got the game for half price during black Friday. It was worth it. Great game for ff fans, but not very newbie friendly.
1029	0	Ok download the game entered in activation code (but you can type in anything).  It kept downloading the same 112mb V1.1 Patch in a loop. Troubleshooted online. Have to download the patch manually and install. (find it on the official Witcher 2 site)and it works if your one of the unlucky few this happens to.
1030	-1	It has a virus!
1031	-1	I bought this expecting it to bring gameplay similar to MW2 back. It didn't. The graphics on ultra look exactly like Black Ops 1 on consoles. It's laughable how s***ty the graphics look even with a mean gaming PC.<br /><br />As many others have said the color palette makes distinguishing players from environment practically impossible. Also, even though all platforms supposedly have dedicated servers you still see players whose killcam is way off from what you are seeing. Idk how they can still be messing this up. MW2 had virtually 0 latency between players. How can we be going backwards in graphics AND in mechanics performance?<br /><br />I can't believe I spent 60 bucks on this. I have some serious buyers remorse.<br /><br />Maybe I'll just go through the campaign and hope I feel better afterwards.<br /><br />I don't recommend anyone buy this game.<br /><br />UPDATE: Midnight 11/9/2013<br /><br />After tinkering with the graphics settings some I turned up AA, AF, Image Quality, and all texture settings to Ultra.<br /><br />The game looks better than before but I've encountered a new issue. I have two XXX XFX 6950s for my gpus. My original review was with only one of them running in Non CrossfireX. When I turned up the settings, the graphics look better but I got way more micro-stutters than before, and varying framerates between 45-60fps. Simply put the game was unbearable. Some maps have big open spaces and some don't. It's the open space maps that cause the game to micro-stutter every 5-10 seconds for no reason at all. So naturally I enabled CrossfireX and hoped that I could play the game at a decent framerate and no micro-stutters.<br /><br />After going into the game I realized just how bad the support for this title is. Not only did I LOSE 15 fps from before, but also I get microstutters every 2-3 seconds. I'm now running the game at 30fps flat with TWO OC'd xfx 6950s in xfireX, AND I'm receiving microstuttering way more often than before. I know the title just released, but steam issued a patch of 199mb just a few hours ago that I hoped would fix some of the latency and graphics problems. It did not improve a single thing.<br /><br />Here's where I'm at right now: I can either turn the graphics settings down and play at a steady 60fps with hardly any microstutters, and get owned because I can't distinguish players from environment, or I can turn the graphics up and have a terrible framerate. Enabling my second gpu isn't even an option because apparently this game doesn't have xfirex support yet. I've received in game reports that SLI and Xfire don't improve framerates no matter which cards you're using.<br /><br />Currently right now I am unable to play this title at a reasonable framerate with competitive graphics. I can't believe any PC game would launch without support for multi-gpu setups. Do they honestly think everyone has a $600+ single gpu setup that can handle the game with ease? With the current console debacle a lot of console gamers have been migrated to PC, and are building reasonably priced setups. This does NOT include a 600+ gpu as normally that's the entire budget for the build. They're going to migrate to PC and discover they should have stayed with consoles all along since getting the game to run properly is just a nightmare for even someone with quite a bit of computer know how. My original rating of 1 star still stands. No multigpu support and a pointless 199mb game update that didn't fix squat. I haven't even gotten around to testing the latency issues I mentioned in my original review, and I may never get the chance since Activision/IW has their head up their @ss.<br /><br />My specs just in case someone is going to ask:<br /><br />Gigabyte 990FXA-UD7 Revision 1 Motherboard<br />AMD 8350 Black @ 4.1ghz, and Cooler Master Aftermarket Cpu cooler<br />Corsair Vengeance 8gb 1866mhz Ram<br />Samsung 250gb SSD with Intel ACHI enabled<br />XFX 6950 XXX Edition x2<br />OCZ 1000watt 80 Plus Gold PSU
1032	0	Story is okay, but game play is nearly all the same from beginning to the ending. And the graphic is really poor in F.E.A.R 1, but it was made years before, so its understandable.
1033	0	One of the yesterday's top games is a bit outdated but still delivers a good story if you can get past the clunky controllers.
1034	-1	Does not F'in work.  I bought this the first day it was released only to find out you get the black screen of death, then they came out with a day 1 patch that did not fix anything.  Still no game.<br /><br />I waited a week now it's 11/27 they released another patch 1.4..  Doesn't fix anything.  Nothing works.<br /><br />DO NOT RISK BUYING THIS FOR THE PC!!  UBI's website is constantly being updated with more patches to come in the future.  I think their not even gonna get the problems resolved this year.<br /><br />I won't be getting anymore UBI products in the future, I have never bought a game on release where I just could not play for almost 2 weeks now.  Joke of a company.
1035	1	So I preordered somewhere else, and I've gotten about 2 hours into my game. The story seems intriguing and the hacking and the computer stuff is awesome. Stealth has it's usefulness.<br /><br />The world is well fleshed out, and the tech element to it is believable, quite immersive really. There's a ton of stuff to do, side quests, mini games, I have no idea, there's a lot of stuff. Going to try the multiplayer tomorrow.<br /><br />Now I'm going to list a bunch of cons, and I really hope they update this game soon. The controls for this game sucks. It's so unrefined, the driving in this game is by far, one of the worst for open world, it's like driving a super fast boat that has horrible handling, and this game has a lot of driving.<br /><br />There are random physic glitches that would cause me to fall (for instance, getting out of a slightly moving car) and it would take forever getting back up that during that time I'm gunned down and I have to retry mission.<br /><br />This game lags randomly, but I guess the spec requirement is pretty high.<br /><br />Running, i7 2600k, 2x 8gb ram, gtx 670 ftw and ssd and it lags on high setting.<br /><br />I would recommend this game because of the sheer amount of content but be prepared for the typical frustrating ubisoft game controls (assassin's creed type moments), if  you're not in a hurry, wait for it to get updated.<br /><br />I love this game despite the crappy controls, but it is day 1, so I'll have to wait for it to get updated... hopefully I won't punch my monitor before then. Will update in the future.
1036	-1	not so exiting. Maybe if you start a new game as a raja... By now, in an ongoing game is almost a waste of money.
1037	0	completely different from the original. its not just a new ending, its a new middle too. the original was fairly adult-content filled (inclucding nancy having to shoot someone) so im sure this one tried to make it a little more kid friendly.
1038	-1	This is a second rate attempt at flight simulation. It does not even come close to EA's old Jane's USAF. It lack a 'cockpit' view - it's more like an arcade view.
1039	0	same reason as all in one mahjong
1040	1	It's Xbox live, what else can you say? This was cheaper than buying the same 1-year card it in a retail store & the code activated just fine.
1041	0	The game is great but it launched with serious bugs. Fortunately they are almost resolved. I recommend it. Good Luck
1042	-1	Look, I have a Surface RT, so I tried downloading it through my desktop and IT DID NOT WORK! So my advice, don't buy it if it's a tablet thing, for the sake of your money
1043	0	I'm used to MMO's where you can get into team based dungeon crawls fairly early.  GW2 doesn't allow that until you spend a considerable amount of time leveling up.
1044	1	I chose this rating, because the buying was quick and easy, and the product fulfill my expectations.<br />I like, how I said, the quickness. I dont have any claim.<br />I could recommend this for any PS3 owner, that ask me for a fast way of buying Psn Store credits.
1045	-1	Couldn't get it to work. was told go here, there, and nowhere that made this game work. You have to download something else plus your computer monitor has to have certain perimeters. Horrible Christmas present.
1046	-1	This is a pretty fun game, or rather it could be really fun if it didn't have issues. In the event of a crash, the most recent item you acquired might not be in your inventory when you reopen the game. This has happened to me twice now. The first time I was not too far in so I started over. When it happened the second time, I did some reading on the internet and this does seem to be a known issue with this game. I have not been able to find a patch to correct the problem. :o( Luckily the game didn't cost very much, but I would still have liked to be able to finish it.
1047	-1	This is a waste of money. It always crashes. Says there's a file missing. tried redownloading 3 times. And no its not my computer.
1048	1	This game is extremely entertaining! The story line lasts for many hours and is very easy to learn and play. The graphics are very good and the game runs well on a PS3 Super Slim.
1049	-1	Downloaded this expansion but it wouldn't let me use it even after i uninstalled and reinstalled the game twice. I kept getting download manager errors.
1050	0	every time I reached another level, the game closed, which made me re-open each time.  Other than that, it's a great game!  Never did this on my 1 hour free trial, but when purchased from Amazon, and downloaded exactly as instructed, it never worked correctly.
1051	0	This is a very difficult game to correctly review because so much about it is terrific, but it's not produced well and has bugs in it and things that simply can NEVER be deduced or figured out. Even the hidden object screens are VERY difficult to find everything and some of it makes no sense at all, or cannot be seen unless you use a hint and some things have a different name rather than the name we recognize them as (we is the U.S.).<br />I have fun playing these games I can actually think out and solve but with this one it's not planed out properly and many puzzles are impossible to solve without going to a hint video or walk-through of some kind.<br /><br />PROS........<br />The good is that it's all about Halloween so is in time with the holiday.<br />The graphics are really great, very good for sure.<br />Music is good.<br />Story is very good as well.<br />Flow of the game is perfect.<br />Plenty of mini-games and hidden object games.<br />Has a SKIP button!!!!!!<br />VERY long game so you get your monies worth for sure.<br /><br />CONS.......<br />Mini-games VERY difficult to even figure out what the puzzle objective is much less solve the puzzle.<br />Hidden Object games are also all but un-fair in parts,and some things just can't be seen as they blend into background.<br />Many times you have to click several times to get it to work.<br />Game stopped working a couple of times and had to exit and restart.<br /><br />With that said, I thought he game was a good one in many ways and finally did get through it with some help from hints and even a walk-though at times and I've played at least 40 of these games before. If you buy this make sure you go to you-tube to see a hint or a few along the way and don't give up.<br />I guess the best thing to say is it's not constructed as well as many other games but in some ways is really good in it's presentation. Having to solve things that you can't even figure out what the puzzle is asking you to do is a TERRIBLE flaw in the game and part of the fault is that the designers are from another country outside the western world and they think differently than we do so it's hard on both sides I guess.<br /><br />These companies need to remember and they don't of course, that the object is having....... FUN....... and not spending hours trying to solve a puzzle that just relies on random hit and miss and brute strength or trying hundreds of possible solutions. That's NO FUN FOR ANYONE!!! I can make a game so hard almost no one can solve it of course but then I only appeal to 12 people in the world and everyone else thinks the game sucks. Be careful ordering this.ry outside the western world and they think differently than we do so it's hard on both sides I guess.

1052	1	I love this game and you will too!
1053	1	Got a digital copy of the activation code<br />Worked instantly<br />Is the best value product in the market for Xbox Live
1054	-1	"DO NOT buy this s***.... the activate on \\""steam\\"" instructions are BS.... what a rip off.... $20.00 for an activation code that cannot be used given amazons 'wonderful\\"" instructions"
1055	0	Não vi nenhuma vantagem a mais em comprar esse pacote. Deveria ter comprado speed boost direto do site da EA
1056	1	I got mine for $34.99 at Origin.. way cheaper than Amazon plus you get online tech support 24/7.<br /><br />The game is pretty sweet but after playing so many different game types the only thing worth playing is the TDM being that the map was made small and there is always fun action for everybody.  The only thing I don't like about this game is the choke point maps.  Its pretty much useless on domination.<br /><br />BF3 Battle log internet based browser is darn sweet.
1057	-1	It didn't work as it would not download and play.
1058	0	I love the Sims 3 and I wanted to get an expansion, I rarely use any of the professions or any of the new venues. I don't really send my Sim's to Simfest. Ultimately, if you are interested in these profession tracks then go for it. It's not as fun as I thought it would be.
1059	-1	this game is a waste of money... the sencitivity is very bad.. the trucks are moving really slow... and of course I cant take the 3d off... WASTE OF MONEY. Already deleted... I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
1060	-1	Hi it was not good for me because my account is in the united arab emirates and by mistake I baught for unites states of america
1061	0	The graphics and zoom perspective are frickin' AWESOME!!!! The Archologies totally rock and the future pack add-on is super cool! High quality in most ways....BUT, unlike other versions of SC, there is no terrain edit in game. The cities building area is limited and to expand you gotta go to other &#34;city&#34; areas. It was confusing for me on how to connect those cities etc. (I'm no genius, but I isn't a box of rocks either. lol). The zoning tool and how it interfaces, I feel is ambiguous. And the train/street car intersect I still haven't quite mastered.<br />  But all in all worth the purchase and fun to play. Thanks!
1062	-1	The latest patch on 13th of Feb 2014 made things worse than the launch date quality.<br /><br />I have a 100Mbps Fiber connection to the Internet with S grade quality but the gaming experience has become awful than ever.<br />Enemy warps a round, making it impossible to aim and shoot.<br />Regardless of that BF4.exe will crash after 2-3games.<br /><br />SimCity was bad, but This game is worse.<br />And the patch after patch things just gets worse so I wont recommend buying it if it was $0.01.<br /><br />Worst game ever I bought.
1063	0	I gave it a 3 star because it is a good fighter but I am ready for realistick graphics in a 3d world. Like Fight night boxing games...I want a fighter with even more realism. A game like that would get a 5 star for sure. ...<br /><br />Anyway this game is fast and well controlled. Older graphics in 2d type game we have all played before.
1064	1	The perfect price for live! Cheaper than the store sells it for And you dont need to leave the house just download the game code.
1065	-1	I lost this card for a little while, and I searched high and low to find it. then my subscription was up, still couldn't find it. I got on my xbox to watch a youtube video and I cannot believe they make you have gold to watch those. So I got on my ps3 and watched the youtube video on the big screen. really upset me.<br /><br />eventually I did find the card and was able to resume multiplayer. I really don't understand why everyone loves the 360 and claim their multiplayer is so much better. I get just as much lag if not more at times.
1066	1	"This game is for \\""hidden object\\"" puzzle fans.  Unlike most others in this genre this game actually contains 5 \\""books\\"" (or puzzles) to work your way through.  As a result of this feature you basically get 5 games in one purchase.  These game downloads aren't known for the duration of their length of playing time but this one is much better in this respect than any other I've seen to date."
1067	0	Game I played for years. Lot several games when I went to windows 7. Doesn't look like you even carry them anymore. Ricochet apparently was not adapted for win. 7. Very sluggish. Oh,Well. Good old game though.
1068	0	The game works fine, once you actually get it installed. I ran into so many issues when trying to install this game, and spent a lot of time on origin's help site. Even now (a month after purchasing) I can't get Late Night to run on my computer, even after getting assistance from three different people on the help site. I wish I could either get a new download of the game, or a third of my money back because the game itself has no reason to not be a 5/5
1069	-1	Loved Far Cry 3, but I can't stand Blood Dragon. The combination of the unskippable, way-too-long tutorial and the fact that it keeps crashing (and sending me back to the beginning) is fatal. I've never gotten past that first bunker interior without it crashing, and I'm too fed up to go through that stupid tutorial again.
1070	0	Works on the steam version of the game, unlike some other Amazon DLC for this title.  Adds a bit more for a cheap price if you can get it on sale.
1071	0	I've found the PC version to be nearly identical to the XBox360 version in almost every way, except it seems to have even more content, and the graphics are better. A lot of people have complained about performance issues, but I've had zero issues in that department. However, to be fair, my system is fairly high end by today's standards, and would have been unheard of back when this game was released.<br /><br />The game itself is dark, with missions that have you doing things that many would find disturbing. Racketeering, extortion, drugs, prostitution, larceny, vandalism, and just being an overall prick are all par for the course here. Personally, it's just not for me. So, from a story and character perspective, this game is disturbing on several levels, and I have trouble playing it for more than a couple hours at a time.<br /><br />However, from a gameplay perspective, and based on sheer content, this game is amazing. There is so much to do, it's just mind blowing. This isn't a complete sandbox, in that you can't choose whether to be a hero or a villain (except sometimes when you're offered a choice to spare someone's life), but it's still a large game world packed full of diversions and interesting things to do.<br /><br />The acting, animations, and character models are also top notch. They've really done a professional job with the presentation.<br /><br />The vehicle controls are a bit sloppy, with squishy suspension, slow braking and acceleration, and poor grip. However, there's a huge modding community surrounding the GTA series, and fixing the flying/driving mechanics to make them more appealing is a fairly simple process.<br /><br />If this game was a little more light hearted, had more character customization options, and didn't force you into playing a total creep, it would be... Saint's Row the Third. If you're looking for a fun open world shooter that doesn't make you feel like a scumbag when you're playing it, get that instead.<br /><br />Three stars because it's got so much content, along with great graphics and presentation, but SR3 is much better game unless you're really serious about being a bad guy.s because it's got so much content, along with great graphics and presentation, but SR3 is much better game unless you're really serious about being a bad guy.
1072	1	This is an amazing game. The mod support is so good, giving the game a extended life and many ways to play the campaign. So definitely pick up the PC version of this game. Offers keep popping up, so it's really great bang for your buck.
1073	-1	no aviation code so I cant play it
1074	-1	Now introducing Call of Duty with Robots.
1075	0	i liked the game, but was not worth the 6 dollers. the game is only like hour half. not long at all. and its not worth replaying. soooo yaaaa.
1076	0	I like these match-3 and this has a nice twist on having to figure out the directions you can match in and also the need to match rows with crystals all under a time limit. Nice power-ups too, though I can't figure out how to get the better ones to activate during play. But I've reached a level that I can't get past during the time limit and it's now just frustrating, so I may give up on it.
1077	1	Was easy and fast. If you need a PS Card don't think about it and buy it.
1078	0	I picked this up for $5 on sale.  Its a great deal for a month.  But the extras that it comes with are pretty worthless.<br /><br />After buying this package for $5, I had a friend send me an invite for a 21-day free trial.  I then used this to increase my time by a month.. as well as its extras.  After playing the game, I realized that most of the stuff I got was worthless after going through several tutorial missions.  I had way more money from the tutorial than all items combined in this package.  The only thing that MIGHT be worth it is the skill booster.. which speeds up the time it takes to train skills.  I think its no longer good after you are 14 days old or so.<br /><br />In addition, if you use this code, any friends that referred you don't get any perks.  If you turn your trial-account into a full-account through normal means, your friend gets a free month.  They might even split the costs with you.  But if you use this game code, they get nothing.  So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone when its full price.  But on sale... its ok.
1079	1	My son said, good game!
1080	1	Excelent !
1081	-1	EA's customer service during this situation has been terrible. You can tell the fish rots from the head down at this company. From every angle of how they handled this it was awful. Terrible or incorrect communication, no effort to alleviate the angry customers, and certainly no effort ahead of time to plan for the obvious success of a game which was made successful well before EA had anything to do with the series. I applaud Maxis on the game (other than the terrible and small city sizes and always required internet connection) but their parent company EA just makes everything about this experience suck. Their call centers are obviously overloaded and they have no ability to remedy any problems over the phone let alone offer a refund for a clearly faulty product.
1082	1	Soo goood
1083	1	Fun game
1084	-1	Do not purchase this game.  There is a bug in the patching system that makes the game unplayable and support from the game company is nonexistent.  If you want to spend $20 and hours trying to make it work, then highly recommended.  Otherwise, don't give this company your money.  I am actively working to see if I can get mine back from Amazon.
1085	-1	****DO NOT BUY****<br />Wait on this game. It truly has the potential to be great, they just need to fix a few game breaking issues.<br /><br />First and foremost, the P2P server system is horrible, and one out of every two games you play will suffer from terrible lag issues. Sometimes I join a game and it's great, but mostly the lag just ruins it.<br /><br />Other than that there is few minor bugs, like the audio of a gun firing constantly playing even though no one is firing a weapon.<br /><br />I will update my review to 4 or 5 stars if they add dedicated servers like they promised. Otherwise, stay away until they do. The multiplayer experience is frustratingly bad right now.<br /><br />All of that being said, I really like the movement, weapon balance, and map design. I really hope they fix this so I can give this game the review it deserves.
1086	1	Two great Rockstar games for $30.  Why are you reading this?  Go buy it already!<br /><br />Both games require a good mid level PC to run, both include good pc options (resolution, AA, shaders...Ect).<br /><br />Only draw back is each game requires a large amount of hard drive space.<br />Max Payne 3: 30gb<br />LA Noire: 13gb
1087	-1	Terrible game direction, hard to play. Sometimes objects are extremely unclear, all you have is some dude yelling in your ear to do a thing without telling you how to do that thing.  Expect to be frustrated a LOT.  Expect to die a LOT.  Only play this game if you're a completionist and want to see everything in the world beaten.
1088	-1	30 Bucks for nothing, dont byu it!<br />Full of Bugs and boring gameplay.<br />And only online playable.<br />Get SimCIty 4 in Steam and play it offline
1089	1	"As a huge fan of \\""American Pickers,\\"" it was great fun to try your hand at what they do every day (minus the dirt, climbing over junk, and long days on the road).<br />Skills required:<br />You have to balance getting your best deal with keeping your sellers happy to get access to more sites.  You have to choose between quick money with an auction (auctioneer keeps 20%) or trying to set your own price (to high, slow sale, too low, fast sale - lose money).  If you do not make sales, you have no money to go out and buy things.<br />Even getting appraisals had a realistic price and consequences.  An appraisal while haggling could lower. or RAISE the price the seller would go for, so that was a gamble. Also neat was that several items were \\""incomplete\\"" and needed a part that was not available at the same seller.  If you found the part and matched them up, your profits went way up.  There  were pros and cons to restoring items before selling.  So many decisions were right in line with what a real \\""picker\\"" would have to do to be successful.<br />I would love to see a sequel. perhaps with more locations and some way to incorporate the travel and shipping costs (larger items) into the scenarios."
1090	-1	product does not work
1091	-1	Against all odds, ESCAPE PLAN turned out to be one of the more interesting action films of 2013, and certainly the best thing either Stallone or Schwarzenegger had done in quite some time.  Now comes the prerequisite video game, and unfortunately, it's less of a home run than the movie was.  Gameplay is smooth as one has come to expect from PlayStation, but the graphics are lacking and fans hoping to play as Schwarzenegger or Stallone will find it difficult to discern which is which as the central characters reflect only a passing resemblance to the celebrated action icons.  A disappointment.
1092	1	It want download because it has a trogan. Also, doesn't work with 8.1. need refund
1093	1	This membership is a real value, less expensive then from other vendors.  If you enjoy Xbox, you will enjoy it online.
1094	0	I never got to play it, tried to down load it several times and it would not let me do it , so I purchased it else where. So how do I get a refund ? I know its been since May but things happened , I had  surgery and did not have the time to get in touch with you before now . If you can credit my account that would be great . Thanks so much . Linda
1095	-1	"When this game launched, alot of gamers out there expected a clean reboot of the underground hit \\""Freedom Fighters\\"".  What we got instead was a cookie cutter shooter that did nothing new but rake in money from their advertising partners (ala White Castle).  Having 'licensed' locations in the game itself was even a joke.  Going into a widely known restaurant in the game...well, it ends up looking more like an empty closet or library from someone's home rather than the real life counterpart.  If the cheap aesthetics alone isn't enough of a letdown to steer you away from disappointment, there's always the 3-4 hour lifespan. All in all, the game tells a decent enough story akin to it's father tale \\""Red Dawn\\"".  But, in the end, you're left wanting more than just a short, linear, corridor shooter.<br /><br />For less than 10 bucks, it's worth every cold cent.  But beyond that you're just asking for insult.<br /><br />Oh, and unless you're a high end ATI user, good luck running this admirably on a 5770 or less.  While most THQ games for PC are optimized fairly well, this one is not so friendly.  If you've got a midrange Nvidia card you'll handle it with no error.<br /><br />I'm giving this game 2 stars because of it's launch history and not just merit alone.  If the game launched at 15 bucks from the start, it would be resting on a 4 instead.  However, because the publisher felt the need to slap us consumers in the face...minus one for being too short, and another for being too overpriced.  Bring back Freedom Fighters in HD I say!"
1096	-1	"This game was a huge disappointment. After reading the description I decided to take the plunge and buy it (no free trial with this one) because I was ready for something other than another Hidden Objects game. The storyline sounded intriguing, the screen shots looked good, so I figured this would be a lot of fun. But not so.<br /><br />First of, it made me seriously motion-sick. This is a first-person game and whenever the cursor moves just a tiny bit the room view/perspective changes. Several times I just had to take a break because all that movement made me nauseous. I also got tired very quickly of having to constantly adjust the view - the game is way too sensitive to cursor movement and so I ended up accidentally staring at ceilings/floors way more often than I would have liked.<br /><br />Secondly, there really was not too much to do in the first place. I spent almost all my time wandering aimlessly through one drab-looking scene after another without being able to figure out what I had to do. So I finally just gave up and never finished it. It was just too boring and depressing. My husband who is a very different game player and actually enjoys solving difficult puzzles, etc. (i.e. not at all an impatient hint hunter like me :-)) also quietly quit playing it. He agreed that it was boring and that \\""it required too many steps to get something done\\"", plus \\""one never knew what one was supposed to do\\"".<br /><br />Had it just been me, I would have chalked it up to this game simply being not my type of game, but this assessment coming from my husband as well convinces me that this is just not a good and interesting game. My admittedly subjective advice: Save yourself the money."
1097	-1	I can't register my game because this was a pre owned game.
1098	-1	I just ordered this game and when I try to play it,it wont do anything,and I know my computer should play it,I have an Alieanware gameing computer and this download does nothing .the registration screen comes up and it wont let me do anything,it wont even let me exit the screen,I have to turn off the computer and restart just to get out of the first sceen,so to sum it up I just got ripped off by amazon,paid for something that doesn't work and cant return,
1099	1	It is so addicting, I cant stop playing it. I definitely recommend it :)<br /><br />Its better than waiting for shipping... and cheaper. So download it ;)
1100	0	"It's a good game, but not for any of the reasons the original Crysis was.    The Bad:  The first had breathtaking graphics that even the most powerful computers at the time struggled to play on high settings.  Here we have optimized-for-console DX9 textures and meager post-processing/lighting/eye candy.    Crysis 1 had huge, open levels with load times to match.  In 2, you spend most of your time in buildings or narrow streets with conveniently blocked off alleys and side streets.    Lastly, it seems the PC version was rushed or had a lower priority than its console counterparts.  The multiplayer serial key issue being the biggest, with other annoyances in single player like the buggy scroll-wheel-power-selector and often unobtainable 'nano catalyst' dropped by the aliens.  And where are the customizable graphics options???    The Good:  Despite being the dreaded 'console port', the visuals are pretty amazing.  Besides Crysis 1 and maybe FarCry 2, it's still one of the best looking games i've ever played.  What's even more amazing is you don't need an all-out gaming computer to play at high settings.    Again, despite the cramped and linear level layouts, you often get \\""taticial options\\"" when entering an area.  This means you can tackle the situation in several different ways, such as sniping, sneaking, flanking, etc.  That, combined with the fact that each level is pretty unique in looks and design, means above-average replay value (but still not on the same level as the original Crysis).    More aliens.  The first two (not including the mini-bosses) essentially only had two different kinds of aliens.  Here we get 4 or 5, which really breaks up the monotony.    The soundtracks: Hans Zimmer.  Enough said.    The Meh:  I was a little turned off by the radical alien changes without any explanation.  They went from flying metal squids that shot ice to walking fleshy things that no longer shoot ice.  I'm not complaining about the change itself, but rather the glaring inconsistency in this sequel.    The AI.  Crytek made a big deal about their state-of-the-art AI, but I still encountered enemies that tried to run through walls, didn't bother taking cover when being sniped, or kept doing the same thing over and over (like jump over an object, run behind it, take cover, and jump over again).    Overall, it's still a good game, with two stars being knocked off for its small, linear levels, low replay value (when compared to the original) and technical problems.  It redeems itself with great visuals, and interesting, balanced gameplay.  Heres to hoping that Crytek will give PC gamers a little more love in their future games."
1101	1	Its xbox live.
1102	-1	This came sucks
1103	0	The game is really average, considering it's predecessors.  The story line is mediocre and definitely is out of context with the other games....considering it's a prequel.  It's also suffers from &#34;stupid ways to extend the game-itis&#34;.  Hopefully I don't release any spoilers. Shaking a virtual floor is one thing, but outright changing the camera angle several times for no reason during a battle is not nice.  Especially when the direction to point your controller in order to move your character is dependent on the camera angle and not the position that your character is facing.<br />  It's not a bad game but the story could have used more work and definitely less uninteresting game stretching battles.  Just my opinion.<br /><br />~J
1104	-1	The team behind this game really need to learn how to communicate with the backers and ea crowd. The game did start off ok in the first version but went down hill from there. Now the team is mostly working on their mobile version which is f2p and have pretty much put the pc side of the game on the back burner. In its current state i would not buy into this game as it is no fun. It is just endless timers, stickers, clicking and useless side voyages to make you stay in the game whilst the timers are going.
1105	-1	I bought the code for 1600 xbox points. Introduced him to the xbox.com site and I wrote that I have entered is not valid code. What do I do? I wanted to buy the game today at a discount shares in the xbox live and your fault I could not. I want my money.
1106	-1	It was a horrible download experience. I kept having all these popups coming up wanting me to download different junk and somehow I ended up with a very bad virus on my computer that I had to pay Norton to go into my computer to get it off.Then I had to go to the regular Sims site and buy the game again.
1107	-1	Way to many issues and problems with the game. EA has refused to support or provide patches even though the have known about the multitude of problems for 3 years now. I returned for a full refund and it's the last EA game I will ever buy. A total 0 rating in my experience.
1108	-1	I have been an avid fan of SimCity since the first version premiered.  This, IMO, is the least enjoyable of them all, by far.  I wish I would have paid attention to the countless negative reviews and not made the purchase, but I didn't - only because I can't play 4 on my newer Mac.  I love some of the ideas within this game, like adding on to many of the civic buildings.  That is a great feature, so for example, you can have one large police station instead of 6 small ones.  I also like the Sandbox mode which allows you to easily use cheat codes to build your city faster.  For me, I have always liked the design aspect of the game much more than the city management aspect.  The problem is the complete lack of space.  You have NO ROOM to build.  For example, the first thing I did in my city was build a grand square in the center.  When I was done, the square alone took up 1/4 of the total building space, if not more.  When you have a city full, advisers keep telling you that you need this and that, but there is no room to put this and that.  I feel like if I put down everything needed to build the great works, or satisfy the citizens, I would have no citizens because I would have to eliminate all the residential areas.  HUGE EPIC FAIL on the part of EA.  Take my advice and do not purchase.
1109	1	I needed something to hold me over and this gets a 10 from me.
1110	-1	DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 8!! A patch released by EA for this game made the game unplayable on my Windows 8 (the game itself showed as running in Task Manager but would not show up in the screen regardless.) I contacted customer support whose solution boiled down to &#34;Just uninstall it&#34; which wasn't helpful at all and I've now sunk money into a useless product that Amazon won't even refund me for.
1111	-1	I bought cuz I tought this was a stem or origin game, but is NOT. You can buy it for same price at steam, not recommend buy it here.
1112	1	"I'm not going to go highly in depth about why this game is worth it, I will leave the in depth reviews to those users with much better prose than myself.<br /><br />I have played quite a number of MMOs, with my largest amount of time spent on FFXI, WoW, and GW1.  I've always loved exploring more than anything.  It was always annoying to me, when I would spend hours exploring an area, to not really find much of anything useful.  But in GW2, it seems like the game has been infused with all of the parts of MMOs which are fun and amazing, while diminishing a large amount of the dull, grinding, boring, \\""work\\"" of MMOs.  You are rewarded for exploring, and almost everything you do will grant you XP.  There are jump puzzles for Vistas which will grant XP when you finally reach them, there are epic and common group events which take place, with or without player involvement.  The world feels alive, and when you're stuck inside a deep cave, all alone, and you're about to die, that's when you'll encounter another player who will conveniently save the day.  The entire world can be explored, at whichever level you are, and it is beneficial to you.  Want to play all of the starting zones on a single character?  Do it, and you'll keep leveling the entire time.<br /><br />I enjoyed GW1, but there were certain things you couldn't do like in other games.  But in GW2, you can jump, you can explore ANYWHERE because the paths are not locked down, the world is not instanced, there's a trading post, and many other things I'm sure I'm forgetting.  But they kept the amazing parts of GW, such as armor dyes, salvage kits for crafting materials, and the general feel and beauty of Tyria (the world).  It is also still possible to log on and play for only 30 minutes and accomplish something.<br /><br />The world is truly an open and alive place.  You don't have to join groups to go kill that quest mob, you don't have to share resource nodes or fight over quest mobs.  Everyone gets equal credit for everything they do.  You encounter someone dying, and you help save them from their mob, then you get credit for killing it, as do they.  You see a resource node on your screen, then you can harvest it, regardless of whether someone else gets there first or not.<br /><br />If you enjoy a game where you can explore a vast and diverse world, be rewarded for everything you do, and can just play for the sake of having fun, then GW2 deserves a try.r everything they do.

1113	0	There is no doubt in my mind that Borderlands 2 is a Game of the Year contender, and the DLC just ups the ante with more characters, story, guns, Guns, GUNS, and hilarity.<br /><br />However, this bundle states that if you were to buy each of them separately, it is only $85.21... the bundle costs $99.97 and last I checked 85.21 < 99.97<br /><br />But buy this game in whatever way you do, and be careful of over inflated prices.
1114	-1	First of all, I'm one of the biggest fan of FM series. I have been playing this game since 08 and this is THE worst series so far. I don't know what Sega had done to the game. 2013 is totally downgrade from previous one. Game itself is broken with full of glitches and 3D game engine is made extremely poorly. I strongly recommend you to stay with your FM2012 or wait for FM2014. Usually, I play at least 10 seasons for each series. However, for FM2013, I only played for an week and went back to FM2012. Trust me on this one unless you wanna waste you money.
1115	-1	FOR SOME REASON BOUGHT A ONLINE DIGITAL CODE FOR MY BROTHER BUT DIDNT GET THE CODE!!!
1116	-1	It deleted ALL my installed sim games, and it won't download. It says &#34;Error&#34; every time I try and now I cannot get a refund!! This is bull crap. I want // NEED my money back so I can actually buy the disc set that will work. This PC is set up for gaming, so I know it's not the PC's fault, it's this ridiculous &#34;Origin&#34; website's fault. They said they have been having a lot of issues with this product. So DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT as a down load!!!! Buy the disc copy. I cannot believe it will not work!! I hate this product and I am usually the one person that will keep my lips shut no matter what happens but this literally just ruined my Christmas as this was my gift. How ridiculous this is!! Don't waste your time, or money on this stupid down load!! It has to be a scam because this is just flat out ridiculous. I have been trying for almost 2 days to get all my games back and now it won't let me download my disc copies because the Season's is trying to download, and won't stop. I cannot believe I wasted my money on this!!
1117	1	The office was quick<br />He reached the promised product<br />I highly tested and works well In future buy you another
1118	0	extra $ required to play more content or play with others online. can't speak to other players. repetitive missions.<br />was beautiful though
1119	0	This game looks fantastic. My parents bought me a $2500 rig to run this game. I can max out the graphics in 2600x1600, and it runs smooth as hell. However my biggest complaint is not being able to skip a lot of the cut-scenes. I really don't want to watch any of it, and I can't even skip the logo screen. From watching the trailer, I expected this game to be running around an open-world and being able to blow s*** up. Instead I'm stuck with another game about a guy seeking revenge. I'm sure this game has plenty of ACTION, but ffs, I have to wait forever until something crazy happens. I'm giving it 3-stars mainly because the graphics and action is far greater than that terribly-graphiced GTA5 game that I have long since quit playing on the PS3. It would have gotten 5-stars from me if all they did was allow me to cut through every annoying scenes!
1120	1	At the price that I bought it I can say it's worth it. I can safely recommend it to battlefield veterans.
1121	0	the game has some new twists and turns but is basically the same as the first installment. Fun to play but repetitious
1122	1	I had heard others talk about these gift cards, but I had never personally experienced them. It was wonderful and everything I expected. When the transaction finished, they emailed me a code to enter on PSN. Sublime.
1123	1	Very good game
1124	-1	"Bought this game when it first came out. The campaign would constantly freeze, glitch, hard-crash to blackscreen..etc. Found an online \\""patch\\"" which slightly improved game performance but did not eliminate it. Conclusion: the campaign was rendered unplayable and thus never completed.<br /><br />Recently, I've bought a new computer and while reloading steam I noticed it in my library and reuploaded it ...Mistake! I simply revisited those forgotten frustrations over again, especially the feeling of getting ripped off. (Which motivated this review.)<br /><br />Saying this, the historical battle simulations didn't constantly glitch and were quite fun, while the price seems reasonable so I'll recomend it with caveat noted above..... hence it gets a two from me."
1125	1	That was the fastest I've ever recieved an online code. It was almost instantly. Product is as described.
1126	0	I call this game a one-off because after you do everything the first time you will probably be uninterested in doing so again. There are a lot of new features to this game but most of them are for the sake of your children. If you don't like having children lingering as such for days upon days--like myself--you won't get much use out of this pack.<br /><br />Shiny new stuff--one of the coolest aspects in this pack is all the new kid gadgets you'll accumulate. Playground stuff includes sandboxes, 3 types of tree houses, mechanical horses, spaceships, and cars the children can ride, a seesaw, slide, hopscotch court, and various children's toys.<br /><br />Clothes--The first thing I noticed about playing Sims 3, and I am relatively new as a Sims gamer, is the lack of children's clothes. With this expansion pack being geared toward children/teen years you'll find much improved in cute/adorable outfits for your toddlers. The teens have some very cool new additions too, along with appropriate hairstyle options.<br /><br />IMAGINATION--One of the biggest and most intriguing aspects of this game is how imaginative the creators have gotten. They've created a very rich world for your toddler, child,  and teen that can make for lots of fun on the first go round. For instance, the tree houses are not just places where kids can climb up to and sit. They can host tea parties, play space pirates, ban boys or girls from coming up, play pranks or even sleep in the tree houses. Children can pretend to drive cars by just sitting on a couch, play royal over a court by standing on a chair, or have tea parties with their stuffed toys.<br /><br />Imaginary friends-- One of the best features included in this pack has got to be the imaginary friend. You'll receive a doll in a the mail from a long lost, relative who you had no part in creating once your child is born. Some people have said that their child never got a doll. I've had that happen, but then I also had a female Sim have fifteen children and all of her children got a doll so I think the odds are good. Anyway, the child must play with this doll OFTEN. As the child grows so does the doll. You will find out later the ways in which a teen or a young adult can actually turn this doll into a human. At some point this doll will start to walk around and interact with only the Sim child or young adult (other Sims cannot see this doll which is where the imaginary friend part comes into play). You can choose the sex of the doll so that when it is turned human it will be either male or female. Child Sims now grown into adults have built such a relationship with this doll--now turned human--that they could marry him or her and have an instant companion. Also, once human, dolls have the ability to change back into dolls. (The children of DTH can also be dolls)<br /><br />Activities: Besides the plethora of ways for children to play and be happy, teen Sims can now be taught to drive, and they can go to prom (you still can't see inside the school, though), date, throw parties when their parents are on vacation, teepee or egg neighbors houses, set pranks up in your own house, and graduate from high school directly after aging up to a young adult.<br /><br />new traits: I think there are two new traits: rebellious and nurturing.<br /><br />new professions: along with the nurturing trait Sims can now be babysitters. I tried it once. It's very time-consuming and your Sim can barely do anything (cook, clean, chat w/other sims) w/o having to pick up and put down children.<br /><br />adult stuff: Most of the the teen clothes can be doubled for adults as well. Adults can now have a midlife crisis--which sometimes includes cheating on their spouse O_o. Adults also get two new, fast, but relatively ugly designed sports cars. Adults can now ground their children or put them in time out. I once had a Sim put her teen son in the corner. They can also get married in style. Unfortunately you won't find any new wedding dresses. I think its part of a ploy to get you to buy some from the main site. You will get a additional generic wedding cake and wedding decor. As far as I know there is no option for honeymoons.<br /><br />School: You can send your child/teen Sim to boarding school where they will not only grow up but develop traits and skills according to where you send them. If you choose to keep your children at home you can sign them up for after school activities or more classes.<br /><br />The partying, the graduation, and the pranks all grew old fairly quickly for me but I still say Sims Generations is worth the price if its reasonable. Note: Amazon runs sells on an undecipherable schedule. I bought Generations for 13 and change but I see its now close to $40. I'd advise any buyers to wait for a price drop.esses.

1127	0	Could be better....decent enough for some fun
1128	0	Okay everybody, it's dissapointing, it doesn't look as good as it should, it doesn't play as good as it should, and the story isn't that good. But the game itself isn't bad, it's just dissapointing. Invisible walls aside, the map and world are expertly crafted, the graphics, while not as good as advertised, are still quite good, and the gameplay is good. The story and characters on the other hand are awful.<br /><br />So, that's watchdogs, It's nothing special, but it's not bad either. It's biggest problem- it just didn't deliver on the hype.
1129	1	Great
1130	1	I haven't actually played the GTA series but I have played a demo and have read lots about it. This seems like a more classy version, but still has the open world, yet goal driven world.<br /><br />Pros: Complex cases make you think, keep your eyes open and at some points act like a true detective.<br /><br />Cons: I stopped playing the game for a few months and it didn't bother me. The cases started to get repetitive &#34;Go here&#34; &#34;look at stuff&#34; &#34;find this guy&#34; &#34;now this guy&#34; &#34;great lets interrogate him and even if you get it wrong, we'll still arrest him&#34; They never really let you screw up and always point you in the right direction...there's no consequences for your actions.
1131	1	Awesome
1132	1	This new expansion will definitely challenge you. Squaresoft went back to its roots when they designed this expansion, be prepared to be challenge in solo and party play.
1133	1	This is not the old X-Com, but I had a great time with this nonetheless. Check it out - no disappointment here.
1134	1	"i just bougt this game $4.99 with coupon. then i activated and installed with steam application. game includes AoE III, Asian Dynasties and Warchiefs expansion packs. you can play all this contents online. if you want to play expansion pack games, you have to go this directory: \\""C:\Windows\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Age Of Empires 3\bin\\"" and find out \\""Age3x.exe\\"" for Asian Dynasties, and \\""Age3y.exe\\"" for Warchiefs content. game works on win7 ultimate 64 bit pretty good. only one matter is, when i start up the game, aero theme close down and turn on basic mode. but after exit the game, theme goes aero again.<br /><br />thanks amazon team for this game and price."
1135	1	I have a lot of fun with this game.  I like searching for things and this is a non-violent game, something I also like.<br />The scenario of each scene is most intriguing and very detailed.
1136	0	This was a down load and that took quite a while. The game its self is good for the money and got it on a whim. Just somthing to go to when bored and really do not play it all that much. Good game for those with out a wheel and just want to find out if they want something more advanced.
1137	0	Battlefield 4 looks astonishing and shows off the power of Frost Bite 3. My problem with this is that BF4 crashes every 30 minutes, it's quite obvious this game was rushed to meet the deadline or they spent too much time on the game looking pretty while completely neglecting whether the game runs properly. Hopefully this will all be resolved in a few patches, but until then I'm not a very happy person.
1138	0	"I knew Curt Schilling the gamer geek long before I knew him as the soon-to-be Hall-of-Fame baseball player as I recall reading an excellent MMO review he wrote for PC Gamer magazine.  Apparently that was just the beginning as he got a loan and sunk a large chunk of his baseball winnings to create this game.  Reckoning features the stylings of former Marvel Comics artist (and baseball fan) Todd McFarlane.  Former Elder Scrolls lead designer Ken Rolston was hired to provide creative vision and bestselling fantasy author R.A. Salvatore was charged with writing the story.  With all of these egos working on one game, it's no surprise the game ends up big and huge.<br /><br />You are the \\""fateless one\\"", or a soul born into a world where the future is not only predetermined, but even seen in advance by some of its inhabitants.  You are the first successful project in an attempt to reincarnate life.  While you wake up with no memory of who you were, your mere existence begins to affect the fate of those around you.  News travels fast and no sooner do you arrive when the facility that created you falls under attack.  You are soon thrust into the Faelands, a continent filled with strange creatures and a variety of landscapes.  Along the way you meet Agarth, a \\""fateweaver\\"" born with the ability to see the future; except in your case.  A mysterious and scantily clad rogue named Alyn Shyr seems to have taken an interest in you as well.  In your quest to find the scientist who resurrected you and to figure out who you once were, you will need to decide whether to trust the advice of these strangers and do battle against the Tuatha, an army a winter fae currently engaged in a civil war against the mortal races.  Before your arrival, the fate of this war was already known.  Now a world where the future is inevitable suddenly becomes uncertain.<br /><br />If the idea of battling monsters for gobs of loot in a high fantasy setting sounds appealing, you'll enjoy this first release from Schilling & Co.  Be aware, however, there are a few rookie mistakes.  The most serious issue, at least for PC gamers, is this game may make you physically ill.  Prior to release, a demo showcased the first few levels of the game.  Immediately the forums lit up with complaints about PC gamers being unable to play for more than a few minutes before experiencing motion sickness.  This stems from a concept known as field of view.  In short, when you are viewing a television across the room, you are seeing roughly a 60-degree angle of vision.  Games developed for video game consoles are programmed with this in mind.  Unfortunately, this causes a problem when you attempt to play the same game on a PC monitor.  Your field of view is wider, usually 90-100 degrees, because your eyes are much closer to a monitor screen.  Unfortunately, this was not factored into the game's release.  For PC gamers it's rather like trying to play the game with your face pressed up against a television and you find yourself trying to, but being unable to, scroll the camera back.  Supposedly a patch is in the works, but seeing multiple DLC released before a single patch is not encouraging.<br /><br />Another common complaint is the game is too easy, even on its hardest setting.  It's partially a reflection of the trend toward extremely challenging games as evidenced by popular favorites like Dark Souls and Super Meat Boy.  In Reckoning's case, you can become very difficult to defeat without trying to exploit the game deliberately.  Weapons and armor become too powerful, too fast, and you will have more gold than you'll be able to spend in later levels.  Aside from the occasional boss monster you may find the game provides little challenge.<br /><br />The art and the environment of Amalur is rather interesting.  Large waterfalls and green forests in one area, sandy red rock deserts in another.  Huge sprawling castles and constricted dungeons with magical doorways.  It's all high-fantasy and somewhat familiar, but still nice to look at.  The soundtrack is cinematic and catchy but somewhat infrequent. The people you meet will ask for your help and spout a line or two on various subjects upon request.  You're never really having a conversation, though.  For all the voice acting, and there is an impressive amount in the game, it's rather like reading the Reckoning Wiki.<br /><br />Thanks to Reckoning, combat in starts to come of age in RPG's (and it's about time, frankly).  Wolves surround you and take turns attacking you from the sides while huge Jottun's throw their huge bellies around to resist damage and knock you off balance.  Enchanters fling spells at you from a distance and other monsters come at you with lightning, giant clubs, or poison tipped barbs.  As you kill baddies you alter and collect their fates.  With enough fate you are able to slip into \\""reckoning mode\\"" as high-powered warrior with extra attack power and the ability to perform crunchy and satisfying slow motion kills while you rain death down upon your opponents.  Combat is Reckoning's biggest strength, and it's what sets the game apart from other RPG's.  It would have been even more effective if you felt much danger of dying.  Because of the relative ease of the game you may find yourself simply mashing buttons to move to the next character instead of learning each monster's attack patterns and weaknesses.  It's easy to fall into some bad habits simply for the sake of moving the game forward.<br /><br />After a while, the game's grand scale and many quests start to highlight the relative lack of variety.  There is no shortage of things to do and starting out I tried to complete every side quest I could find while exploring the areas for lorestones; collectable items designed to enhance the story and reward explorers with statistical bonuses.  I scavenged the areas for alchemy reagents and did battle with any enemy unfortunate enough to pick a fight with an experience-hungry warrior/rogue.  It was fun.  After a while, though, the quests started feeling mighty familiar and the towns started looking mighty familiar and the enemies... well, you know.  A month later and 80 hours into the game, things aren't much different than the first few hours.  Suddenly it dawns on me that, for all of the quests I've completed and the people I've saved (or killed), my actions have made no impact on the Kingdom of Amalur.  If, however, you're the type of person who enjoys the grind for the sake of grinding, whether it's finding a rare weapon, finishing the various faction quests, completing all of the game's achievements, or just a set of armor, then Reckoning may be the game for you.what familiar, but still nice to look at.

1139	1	Ignore most of the negative reviews. Those problems have been addressed. Every MMO has its hiccups at launch. Buy this game, you won't be disappointed!
1140	-1	I find it absolutely unacceptable what EA has done with the DRM on this game.  I spent over $70 on this game (Digital Deluxe Edition) and cannot even play it because the servers are overloaded.  Would like to get my money refunded but their 800 number is down and the wait time on chat is 350 minutes.  Shame on you EA.  You have lost a customer FOR LIFE.
1141	1	Very fun real world game! You can do almost anything.  Only bad thing is the constant language for the younger audience but that's what the ratings are for.
1142	-1	I bought this because i have heard good things about it. I downloaded it and set up an account, but thats as far as i could go. The Trion websire is horrible. It will not let me add the key code, the customer service link is broken (will not let me send a question to help resolve the error 2002). I have tried the whole password reset thing, tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Nothing. ERROR 2002 every time. I go back to the website, half the links go to and error screen the first five clicks, nd when i finally get to the account managementscreen, my payment info is gone, my key isnt there, and it says i havent bought the game. Ive been fighting with this for the past two hours and im about ready to give up on Rift and Trion. is there anyone that know how to resolve any of these issues? Or is there a way to get a refund on my 24$? Please help.
1143	-1	"First off if you don't have broad band..Don't buy it! It takes at least 24 hours to download.  Second, after I installed it (twice..I uninstalled and then reinstalled, I downloaded it and deleted it and downloaded it again) I got \\""ghost\\"" players both times.  You can only see the guy's hair and not the rest of the body when you play.  Third the sound quality is bad.  It is low and sparatic.  The price for this download was excellent but, as the saying goes, \\""If it's too good to be true, it probably is!\\"" DON'T PURCHASE THE DOWNLOAD VERSION. BUY THE DISCS AND TRY PLAYING OFF OF THAT FIRST!"
1144	0	"This could have been a great game but it was marred by some obvious flaws!First off this is a beautiful game very nice to look at with the right graphics card and there is somthing to be said about shooting endless hordes of robots \\""never gets old\\"" however this game suffers from some balance issues like too much adrenaline<br />there are parts in this game where you just cant catch your breath its constanly out of the frying pan into the furnance with boss after boss fight in sucession this for me tends to get old also the game was overall rather short.So if you like a white knuckle thrill ride where you cant catch a breath then this is for you!"
1145	0	The download, install, etc. was easy and straight forward. However, the game itself was quite short for this type of game. We beat it easily in one sitting. Not sure it was worth buying since it is not a game you play multiple times.
1146	-1	I attempted to get a refund, wait time of 80-110 mins. After dinner (aprox 60mins) i was abruptly disconnected! If I paid someone $60 to kick me in the balls.... I would be able to say I got the services that I paid for. After 4 days now, I have played 3 hours and all was lost after a (supposedly rare) server crash. FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON, SOMETHING THAT OFFERS SOME KIND OF RETURN.
1147	1	I want to play legendary hacker so fast.
1148	0	Haven't finished this game yet but it was ok so far. It is fast paced and requires paying attention no idle sitting here. The targets are sometimes a little hard to spot though.
1149	1	Thanks for the savings!  Why would anyone pay $60 through Xbox when you can pay $50 here?<br /><br />Just copy the code and you're done!
1150	-1	The campaign is amazing as expected. But as for replay value not much for me. Highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of story driven shooters
1151	-1	I do not even bother with game that do not have controller support......So I never even played this game....tried but couldn't.
1152	0	The game is unable to be played in Windows 8.  I am giving it an average rating as I have seen the game on someone else's machine but I couldn't get my copy to load.
1153	1	This is one of the best game I've played on my Kindle. It's fun with loads of different levels. The game start easy and then get slightly more difficult after each chapters. I love it.
1154	1	After beating Shogun 2, I was left wanting more so I bought both the Rise and Fall of the Samurai expansion packs.<br /><br />Rise of the Samurai is practically the same thing as Shogun 2 except three major differences: units/forts/technology are more primitive, you play as a part of a larger faction, and the agents' roles have been reworked. I enjoy the cutscenes (however, very rare) that the Total War games have, but the ending movie of Rise of the Samurai falls flat compared to Shogun 2. That's a small complaint though. The new (well, old I guess) units bring a breath of fresh air from Shogun 2, especially Foot Samurai who are pretty much the all-around fighters. Otherwise, you get the same types: spears, archers, and cavalry. Rise of the Samurai isn't as intense as Shogun 2 due to not having the 'Realm Divide', but having to decide the fate of your sister faction faces you with almost as much as a problem.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Shogun 2, Rise of the Samurai should definitely be looked at.
1155	-1	DIDNT HAVE ANY CREDIT NEED REFUND CODE(WC40376-0)
1156	0	this one is good in parts but impossible hard in spots and it gets repetive once you have cleaned out an area after short time everything respawns . I like tiny tina but not in this one.
1157	1	great fast love it is a must for ps4 network especially for all digital sale, it work for all account
1158	-1	Game is Horrible. Don't believe the 5 star votes!<br />There are so many Bad things about this game to even describe.<br />Save the Money and Headache play Rift.
1159	1	Picked this up during a sale and couldn't be happier! Haven't jumped into the game yet, but for the price I had to grab it.
1160	1	These are convenient for gifting and limiting your exposure to fraud as well protecting your wallet from a child's impetuous urges.
1161	-1	keeps telling me that my key is in use... i want my blasted money back......now. This is a rip off
1162	-1	This game is a lot worse than I expected
1163	0	I bougth this subscription as a black friday deal for 30 dlls and I still have not be able to put it in the redeem codes it says an error has ocurred what can i do
1164	-1	After purchasing Out of the Park 16 on PC, instantly thought it would be a fantastic computer game that would reel me away from my console platforms. The download took nearly and hour and half, and after that it download information, stats, and players which took another 30-45 minutes.<br />Nevertheless, I waited a few days and jumped back on and became very disappointed as I came across how slow it ran on my new laptop. Constantly lagging and took minutes to go to each page. I tried to auto-sim a game, and that did it in for me, the entire game froze. I turned my laptop off completely and told myself I will never play that game again.
1165	-1	My daughter was really looking forward to playing this game, unfortunately, she was too impatient to let me do research on it. I could have saved some money, had I read through the reviews. I hope it will one day be compatible with the computers we have, now its just a worthless file on her computer.
1166	-1	Very annoying program.Not suitable for beginners.Hints it gives often do not make sense.It is enough to put you off playing.
1167	1	The game is pretty cut-and-dry, but what it does: it does well. It's a co-op zombie shooter with good (not great) graphics and interesting currency/leveling mechanics. It's a proven winner for group play sessions and an absolute hit at LAN parties. It's often discounted. If you're a huge fan of DLC, do your research as there's simply a TON of it out there if you want a complete collection.
1168	1	A great 1940s world with plenty of mystery to go around.
1169	-1	I played this for ten minutes and hated it.<br />This is a total fail!<br />Guess I bought into the commercial  before there were any reviews.
1170	1	I loved everything about the game (excluding the infamous ending).  It was a fitting end to the Mass Effect trilogy, and I can't wait for the next installment.
1171	1	Excelente Product!! Just as described by seller!
1172	0	It's an okay game price but found it rather repetitive and boring after a while. If you like find object games you'll most likely enjoy this one.
1173	-1	doesn't run smoothly enough on my vista machine to play
1174	1	No issues
1175	-1	12 hour download another 3 or so to get updates patches and drivers. cant get fast servers that allow newbies, newbie friendly servers have slow choppy play.
1176	0	This game of Streetfighter 4 arcade edition is well worth the money but you should know that when you buy this download for your PC, it requires you to log in on your Xbox account or Hotmail account since it's all Microsoft anyway. I believe this is done for the purpose of a DRM or for anyone not to steal or borrow the download to anyone else. Which in turn is a huge pain in the ass! Every time you play the game on your PC you have to log in and download the &#34;update&#34; and that can take a few minutes depending on your internet speed. If your good with the inconvenience then purchase the game. In my opinion they really need to specify that this is a Xbox download not just a PC download.
1177	0	This game is really for children and would be somewhat challenging to them. Colorful graphics.
1178	1	A must buy if you love the FF series, the only bad thing or disadvantage is that...this is a STEAM game and like all STEAM games you need an internet connection to play due to the crazy checks the game performs every minute or so. I would recommend buying RETAIL version if you can.
1179	0	Very good time management game, clear in it's presentation, plays quite well.    The negative is that this is NOT FIT FOR WIDESCREEN, it produces a black bar on the left and right hand side of the screen and the main playing area is squashed (compared to non-fullscreen mode which has the right aspect ratio).  With no option to stretch it to fit the screen, or otherwise have those areas filled in with more appeasing content, this gets many lost stars, and is not recommended to anyone using widescreen monitors.
1180	1	Product was immediately emailed to us, correct code, and we were able to plug it into the Xbox right away.  Plus, we saved $20 on a year subscription.
1181	0	Good,<br /><br />to buy some arcade games.... excellent price!!!<br /><br />¡¡¡¡Xbox LIVE 400 Microsoft Points [Online Game Code]!!!!<br /><br />Amazon congratulations<br /><br />Att. Vic H.
1182	1	I had forgotten this game.  Loved it then, love it now.
1183	-1	It doesn't work on my computer.  And I had to down load &#34;Stream&#34; a game playing system onto my computer for this game and it still doesn't work and this &#34;stream&#34; starts every time I turn my computer on.
1184	-1	How far Bioware has fallen.
1185	1	Just order get code & enjoy I would definitely recommend it.
1186	0	Although this is a very good hidden object game and has good graphics and art work, I, too, was disappointed that it is only half of the game.  I knew that going in but still thought it would be longer than it is.  You can complete it quickly even if you get stuck a few times.  I also found it to be frustrating at times, especially when you forget to pick up an item you need that is not automatically added to your inventory.  I also became very annoyed with the heroine's voice primarily when you are stuck and she keeps repeating the same dialogue, many times in a condescending tone.  If you are satisfied with half a game and can wait for the sequel (unannouced release date) then go for it.  It's enjoyable to play especially for fans of the books and the series.
1187	-1	"I was horrified to learn that the DRM on this game is now set up to prevent more than 3 hardware upgrades on your computer. Go over that limit, and it's Game Over for you, and Ubisoft has no intentions of helping fix the issue.  This is the last Ubisoft game I purchase. Considering that I've switched through 3 graphic cards in the last 2 years, such a ridiculous DRM implementation does nothing more than to annoy their paying customers. And then they wonder why piracy is so rampant.  I know that some folks will comment about this not being \\""relevant\\"" or a reflection of the game, but when it comes to game publishers pulling such cheap tricks on their customers, they deserve no forgiveness or mercy.  Besides, I want everyone to know that this game will not work on their PC after 3 hardware changes, so they should think twice before spending their money on this game."
1188	0	Only if you have spare cash, the initial benefits are nice, but essentially you are paying EA to let you play with your friends.  Origin required, browser launched game is the worst idea since hitler mustaches. Seriously though, only purchase if you are desperately bored (i am also talking about the base game).
1189	0	Solved riddle in Under Carriage Scene - But it never took, now I am stuck there.<br />Have tried several times to clear this up. Last resort re-install.
1190	-1	Old school game, in the worst way.  Most of the diolog you have to read very little of it is talking.
1191	-1	The code does not work! do not buy it, waste of money. You can not even apply for a refund.
1192	0	My game stalls every time there's a change in weather and when it snows the whole screen flashes white including the menu bar at the bottom. It's very strange.
1193	0	Good one but coh1 is way better
1194	-1	Okay so I have tried so very hard to get this game I was recommended Amazon. Well when I did this, I had done everything right. Now when I play this game it is soooo slow on my 500GB gaming laptop. I am not happy with this product I could have gotten something better than this game. Thanks Atari

1198	-1	Not Playable
1199	0	It is too predictable.. I need something more exciting and challenging. Make the next one with better graphics and better characters
1200	1	ok
1201	-1	I bought this product off of the terrible thing known as Origin. I spoke with their customer service over getting a refund like their press release said.<br />Guess who got denied a refund? This guy. I'm stuck with $60 gone out of my account and a countdown timer. I'm absolutely livid with EA right now.
1202	0	I wanted to like Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. I love the (admittedly westernized) genre of strong princes and fair princesses set against a backdrop of rocky mountains, roiling sand and Moorish castles. I was hoping to get some of that with some good graphics, music, story, and some climbing thrown in.<br /><br />Well, forget the story. There is one, but not so you'd notice. The game is a series of climbing puzzles / challenges, with some hack 'n slash combat every so often. The combat is fairly easy, and the puzzles, with two exceptions, are not that hard to solve. Actually playing the puzzles through, though, is intensely frustrating (I play exclusively with a keyboard + mouse). Lag is extraordinarily high. The game is sometimes not sensitive enough to input, and at other times too sensitive. Some skills and abilities are on a timer (freeze water for X number of seconds), so what seems a minor annoyance at the beginning of the game magnifies into greater and greater significance later on (expect The Aqueducts level to really give you trouble). I can put up with all that, though. The killer blow for me is the same thing I hated in Ubisoft's sister platformer, Assassin's Creed. Get into a place with one path forward, and the camera view locks up: you can't turn and look to see where you need to go without just blindly following the path indicated by the camera lock-up. I absolutely HATE this; I hated it in Assassin's Creed, and I hate it here. In this case, without the ability to look around, you'll die multiple times until you realize, oh, I need to go in X direction, so I need to do the upwards back-and-forth-between-walls climb three times to reach my objective ledge. Incredibly frustrating, and for me a game-breaker.<br /><br />As I said, the story is near non-existent. An invading army is attacking the castle, so the Prince's brother Malik unleashes King Solomon's army - of sand soldiers, as it happens. The Prince has to figure out a way to corral the army - and stop his brother, who seems to be accumulating the power of the sand-soldiers with each one he kills. Whatever. I never really felt a connection to any of the characters. They're just there as an excuse for some platforming. The graphics are good, even by 2010 standards - fire looks very realistic, and backdrops are gorgeous, but the water is strangely low-res. And there is a lot of water in this game. The music is suitably evocative, but after capturing the initial mood, is repetitive and unexciting (though the orchestration uses a number of different instruments and it sounds well-played).<br /><br />Incredibly disappointed in The Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. Not because it is bad per se, but because frustrating gameplay mechanics mean I'll be moving on to something else.army - and stop his brother, who seems to be accumulating the power of the sand-soldiers with each one he kills.

1203	1	good game
1204	1	Great game- took awhile to get used to after playing The Sims 3 for years. The emotions are an interesting thing to play with. But after a few weeks of playing this base game, it got really boring, and the fact that you were stuck at home and had to wait through waiting screens to get to other places was annoying. Maybe I need to get an expansion pack. But there's good and bad to this game for sure. It was hard not to buy The Sims 4 after playing the Sims 3 for so long and after watching gamers online play the game.
1205	1	A good way to utilize your amazon gift cards to pay for a PlayStation Plus subscription. The subscription itself provides many free games, and a convenient automatic system update and patch installation.
1206	0	Path to Success is not too bad.  At least it doesn't have a lot of the adult stuff Sims has.  I'd really like to find a program that would allow you to play at life without having to do certain goals at certain times. I would love a game where you can choose your own clothes, (this game covers that pretty well) decorate your own home or apartment(the designs on this for decorating are horrible),design your mate, choose your own career path and see what your doing.  Example, this game says your going on a cruise which is nice, but it would be great to see places to visit and to see your player interacting.  There isn't much interaction with people so if your looking for that try Life Quest instead.  It is cool that they allow you to go to the fitness center, swim with dolphins and visit a museum.  Beware of the energy it takes on a laptop.  My fan is always running during this game. There is a lot of activity during the character's sleep (which is quite lengthy), cars zooming here and there, very time and energy consuming and unnecessary for the game. The best thing about this game is you don't have to put up with any bad attitudes from others in it like other games of this type have.
1207	1	"First off, I will admit I've been a video game coma for the last few years.  I've mostly been playing XBOX 360 when the occasional new *hot* game would go on sale. (Mostly during Christmas time)  My PC (a fully capable Core i7 machine) was mostly used as one mean Internet surfing/Facebooking overkill machine!<br /><br />I was going to get this game a few months ago but all the complaining about Origin kept me away.  Then EA had this game on sale over the weekend so I took the plunge.  I have to say I'm really impressed by the graphics and game play.  I've mostly been playing Campaign to get the hang of things and it's definitely getting a little repetitive (kill dudes, run for cover, kill dudes, run for cover, repeat).  But the occasional vehicle excursion and other extracurricular activities keeps things interesting.<br /><br />So about Origin and Battlelog.  It's really too bad EA had to get greedy and do their own wannabe \\""Steam\\"".  So now we gamers need to have Steam, Battle.net, and now Origin accounts.  Soon with Windows 8, we'll have the App Marketplace to deal with as well. Thanks for making it easy for us!  Origin doesn't seem to really have any good deals on their games.  Why this game needs to interface with my web browser (and require a PLUGIN) is beyond me.  It's annoying but you get over it and shouldn't stop you from playing this game.  Besides, for FPS games I'll stick to a keyboard and mouse vs a gamepad ANY day."
1208	-1	I am a longtime strategy player and was really looking forward to playing this game, so I'm saddened to have to write this review.<br /><br />Here are the main points:<br /><br />1. This game is almost a complete abstraction. It is literally spreadsheet after spreadsheet. The upside is that the spreadsheets have nice little colonial-era curlicues all around them.<br /><br />2.You have memorize literally hundreds of icons. All these spreadsheets are almost completely without text, as they rely on icons to give significance to the numbers.<br /><br />3. The spreadsheets are not set up so that the relationships between the data points are clear.  And the overall meaning of each spreadsheet isn't summarized anywhere.<br /><br />4. The tutorial is trivial. I did the entire tutorial, and learned about 5% of the game. There's no obvious way to learn the rest of it.<br /><br />5. There is no manual...except on Steam. Because of Steam's many problems, this makes the manual functionally unavailable. So prepare to spreads LOTS of time scrolling through forums trying to get simple questions answered.<br /><br />6. I bought the game on Amazon, and then found all I really had was a game key I had to redeem on Steam. Steam, as many gamers will attest, is a buggy mass of problems. I specifically bought this from Amazon because I didn't want to go anywhere near Steam after my last experience with it, but now I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />Once again, I'm saddened to write this. I had high hopes for this amazing wunderkind usually touted as &#34;making Civ V look like Risk.&#34;  My suggestion, save yourself $50 and 30-50 frustrating hours trying to figure this thing out and look elsewhere for your next game.
1209	1	This package is a good value. I caught it on sale a few months ago so it was even more of a deal than usual. Thanks!
1210	1	I love this game, I love all building games but this one is great. Please make more of these type of game.
1211	1	5 star
1212	0	"This is one of those games that no matter how you purchase this game, you will have to play through the steam client (mac/pc or boxed). So when a retailer is charging $x.xx about for mac box and $x.xx of mac download, the game is tied to product code you receive, so even if you buy the mac boxed version, you will still be able to play the \\""pc download\\"" version on a pc if you have one. In my opinion, I LOVE steam, what I hate is that it seems some retailers will take advantage of consumers that don't  really know a lot about the product they are purchasing. Bottom line: purchase the cheapest version of this game, because in the end, all you are purchasing is the product code to play on the steam client. Also, current purchase price for this game (pc download) is a GREAT bargain if this is your type of game"
1213	1	Excelent!
1214	0	Gameplay for this game is really fun and its something new and fun you can find a lot of new things to do...but there's just a few simple problems the uptime on this game is awful! there's almost maintenance for the servers every week for 6-8 hours sometimes even 2 days straight it was pretty irritating and severs had a lot of lag at times. and there's no PvP except arena witch is pretty boring. and there's no dueling...The questing for the game could of been fun but almost everything is texted and subtitle and sometimes has missing audio effect. There's no voicing for this game at all and its all text based storyline/quests.<br /><br />This game can be worth the 13 bucks a month if maybe it has a little more better uptime for the servers and if it has more to do other than PvE mostly. that's why I give this game only 3 stars.
1215	1	Easy and safe
1216	-1	My husband used to play a version of this game when he was younger.  I saw it and thought it would be a nice surprise for a Christmas present, I bought it and downloaded it to his computer Christmas Eve, after he updated it, he tried to open the game and it crashed, after a few more tries, he re installed the game, thinking that maybe that was the problem, but it wasn't.  His computer is relatively new and running Windows 7, so it's not his computer.  I have emailed amazon several times about this issue with the game crashing and not being able to play it, but I have not received one email back. So I've basically wasted around $40.  Shame on Amazon for not answering question/emails about this.<br />Never again will I download a game from them.
1217	0	I'd hoped this was an improved version after seeing the trailer.<br />It feels like the first flatout I bought about 7 years ago, and still does not<br />support Nvidia surround view and I'm assuming the same for crossfire .
1218	0	I love Fishdom, all of them, but this one only has the one background.  it's tiresome to do the same tank over and over.  I enjoy Fishdom 3 much better, it is more interactive with the animated fish!  Very relaxing to watch, fun to play.
1219	1	I'm a campaign guy i dont do no online gaming for these games and i can say that COD ghosts is a great campaign game to play, i have played the BF4 campaign but COD definitely hits the top mark. i cant wait to play it again!
1220	0	I really enjoyed the other hitmans, but this one tried to shoehorn a story and characterization in. WHY?<br /><br />Too many games nowadays want to be movies. I'd rather PLAY than passively watch, thanks.<br /><br />That said, it's still got some fun sneaking and killing elements. But I would wait til it's half price or better in a year or so.
1221	0	Every fun game! But when maxed my graphics my would run into issues with body structures on charictors not all of them. But every annoying! Had to turn down detail for it to be playable. It's not my system. I'm running 2600k@5.0 ghz 16 GB 1866 4x4 6990+6970 oc (6970 in another system currently so it's not crossfire fault)
1222	0	short fps game... didn't bother the online part...
1223	1	good~
1224	0	This has to be the most terribly optimized game I've played.  Just looking at it I have it on full settings and yet it simply doesn't look -that- good.  It looks like it should be running at 60 FPS easily and yet it chugs along sometimes slowing down to unplayable during action scenes.<br /><br />That said the game is well written and actually kept my interest for quite some time despite the absolutely abysmal performance.  The action is somewhat few and far between but the moody music and futuristic ambience as well as the somewhat interesting story line, writing and characters will keep you coming back for more if you are in the mood for a somewhat relaxing game experience.  I would definitely not call this an action game although there is action here and there.. but wow I threw in Unreal Tournament 3 just for comparison and it looks soooo much better and runs sooo much better I just have to wonder what in the hell they are thinking when they make these games.  I almost think the hardware manufacturers are paying these guys to make the games so badly so that you need to upgrade.  I have games that look soooo much better and run soooo much better, I just don't see what is chugging this game up so much.
1225	1	This a good installment in the Bioshock franchise that carries over too many limitations from the console version. Game play is smooth and playing at native PC resolutions is a modest improvement over the 360 version but the developers could have spent more time accommodating the better hardware available on the PC. Now that the price has finally started falling, I think this is game worth playing, but parents should be aware that there is quite a bit of controversial imagery in this game; it is necessary for the story but it may upset some people.
1226	-1	I downloaded this game years ago for free.  If I bought it from you I sure didn't receive it.  Now the free version wan'ts money, and I won't pay it!
1227	0	Fun to play and funny as well but much too short.  I've palyed the first two games in the series but to continue gets costly.
1228	0	longest pc download ever but realy fun i wish i wold of got the disk but i love it very much
1229	-1	Screw this game and screw amazon I wrote a whole in depth review about this boring game and for some reason the page reffreshed and my five paragraph review is gone an advertisement no doubt I'm not ordering anything else from amazon I've had nothing but problems and half hearted assistance
1230	-1	this don't work on the new windows so I am not happy I love the game but they need to tell people that it will not work
1231	1	Excellent! 100% recommended.
1232	1	This game is nothing compared to DA:O, but with better graphics and a new wheel of dialogue of options, it's still pretty good. Also, the companions are good. Really, the only problem I had with the game was the weapons restrictions, meaning my mage couldn't use swords, but it was only a minor drawback and I fixed it with a mod. Overall, a pretty good stand alone game
1233	-1	because o third party crap never got to play
1234	0	I wanted the game and have it for my steam account and it was on sale too.. not played it yet.
1235	0	As a longtime MMO player, I was excited for this.  I played for roughly two months and then became bored.  I went back to WoW, EVE Online, and Aion (after it went free to play).  The combat is fun but everything else is pretty basic for today's mmo's.  I will definitely come back to this once some more content comes out.  Very polished game and not many bugs that I found.
1236	-1	Downloaded the game and it won't install on Windows 7 - I've been able to install the other Total War games with no problem
1237	1	Awesome!!!!
1238	1	KICK @SS GAME......
1239	1	It worked.
1240	1	Enjoyable game.  I've played it quite a bit.
1241	0	Its an okay game. The problem is content you do the same things over and over. If you are a PvP player this is a good game, you can compete and get some better gear but for a PvE not so good you gear becomes restricted. Levels seem to be tied to gear and not experience points.
1242	1	Years ago my son and I enjoyed playing an earlier version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. So I got this as a family Christmas gift. We again enjoyed making parks, adding rides, and this time we can even place fireworks displays! The only down side is that in some of the parks you have to please VIPs who have random expectations. I've found building to please someone else less than satisfying. However, that requirement is only in a few of the parks offered. Anyway, that aside, I've enjoyed becoming a tycoon again.
1243	0	Although this game is loads of fun, I would recommend getting the HD version, as the graphics are severely dated.
1244	0	Great to remember old times playing THPS to the old tunes that musicized my teens. Great fun, despite not having local multiplayer.
1245	-1	Half of the games will not load... and it's not the computer.<br /><br />Brand new PC with graphics card, but for some reason half of the games for Command and Conquer will work, and the other half won't load.  Very frustrating.
1246	0	Not bad. Meant more for a younger person though.
1247	1	Easy to use and purchase
1248	-1	It's heroes trying to be world of warcraft.<br />I lost all faith in this series due to this bloody product.<br />I beg of you, don't buy this, don't contribute to disappointment in this world!
1249	-1	Never again.  Product doid not run on our computer.  The downloading process was incredibaly frustrating; plagued by predatory updating messages which led to veiled sales pitches.  Really a pain.  And then.... the stupid thing doesn't run.<br /><br />Never again.
1250	-1	I like the ASWD movement and using the mouse to turn.  I didn't see this as an option so I got frustrated pretty quick.
1251	-1	I don't think I would be able to take the time to &#34;get used&#34; to this game. It feels cumbersome, and there was very little I thought was good. Of course, I love Ghost Online and how fluid everything is on it. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1252	0	This is the best Crysis game IMO (I disliked the two newer urban-based ones). I liked the island-based storyline and the overall gameplay mechanics. The graphics are mostly beautiful, except for the lighting which gets a little funky inside of buildings. For a 7 year old game though, it is still quite impressive.<br /><br />The flaws are few but fairly significant:<br />1. This game will not run as-delivered on a 64-bit OS. You need to get a work-around patch through third-party sites in order to run it.<br />2. Game is fairly buggy. Unexpected crashes happen every couple of missions, and there is one questline which is bugged.<br />3. Didn't like the alien/scifi twist that occured at around the 2/3 mark.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a decent game IMO, and worth picking up for under $20.
1253	0	Overall it is a solid game.  The story is engaging.<br /><br />However, I have some complaints (that have probably already been stated).  This game lacks the variety expected in the games descended from the Infinity Engine.  You can only play one character (it can be male or female), unlike in Dragon Age: Origins, where you could pick multiple races and origins within those races.  In addition, you play through the same dungeons multiple times over the course of the game.  The replay factor just doesn't really seem to exist here.  The conversation choices they give you are interesting, but if you don't follow the same &#34;personality&#34; dialogue choice every time in a single conversation, you sound extremely bipolar at times.<br /><br />Lastly, the combat just doesn't seem as crisp and engaging as Origins.
1254	-1	My code never worked I ended up getting a refund be cautious to buy, may not be worth it sadly.
1255	-1	"First off, let me say... If you are a fan of the Disciples Series, or you enjoy well written turn based strategy, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME!  There are a few good points to this game, but they fail to raise this to the level anywhere near passable.  Pros:  *Excellent character mapping.  *Some very decent combat scenes  *Great artwork  *The addition of strategic spots in combat.  By standing on the right hex, you can double your melee, magic or ranged attacks.  *Advancement skills are displayed as a \\""path\\"".  This allows you to aim for desired skills and see what is needed for each.  The previous games just listed the skills for you to choose.  Cons:  *The save game feature lacks the ability to create new entries.  Internet blogs claim this problem was fixed with a patch, but that only allowed saving to the autosaves.  *There are NO standard key mappings.  When starting the game, each screen requires a different button to skip.  One is the mouse, another is space, another is ESC.  *The ESC key, normally the default for bringing up game menus, is useless.  The game menu is a small gear button, not easily visible, at the top left of the screen.  *Character voicing is absolutely pathetic.  In the earlier games, the character voices were appropriate (the Undead sounded like they were dead).  In this incarnation, it feels as if the actors were told to just read the lines, no characterization needed.  *Combat is utterly confusing.  The order of battle seems to follow no rhyme or reason.  Some members get multiple turns before the others do, and standard Disciples strategy is non-existent for various reasons.  Ghosts do not paralyze enemies long enough to prevent an attack, but adding a werewolf to the party eliminates the need for any other types in the party.  *Rod bearers have been eliminated in favor of \\""wells\\"". Gaining territory is requires taking control of these \\""wells\\"", either by clicking on an unclaimed one, or fighting a \\""guardian\\"".  This means you can'tjust drop a rod where you want for better strategy.  *The maps are way too busy.  It is nearly impossible to make out paths, enemies and resources. There is not a lot of \\""free\\"" area to travel, meaning the explorable area is narrowly confined.  I could continue on with this, but the simple fact is that many of the things that I loved about the older games is missing or badly mangled here.  I just wish I could get my money back!"
1256	-1	Absolutely horrible.  Broken in about every way imaginable.  I'm writing this review years after it came out and nothing has been resolved.  Population growth is broken and they are in no hurry to fix....but they certainly have plenty of time to shove paid DLC after paid DLC down your throat.
1257	1	I really loved this game. It's like Uncharted but you get some upgrades to your character and weapons. It's a little like the Metroid games in that you unlock equipment that will let you get to places that you couldn't previously get to.<br /><br />The graphics are some of the best I have ever seen. I couldn't believe I was seeing real time, in engine stuff sometimes.
1258	0	This expansion just didn't do it for me.  The new town buildings were nice- and I enjoy going to work with my sims, but I think that open for business was a lot more pleasurable!  Having careers for the artistic endeavors made it worth the three stars, but it just wasn't as exciting- the ghostbusting career was especially disappointing for me.  I didn't list but a few sim days with that one it was just so boring setting up a queue of ghosts while managing my others sims.  Cooking and going to the restroom seemed more interesting to me.<br /><br />I really wished I liked it more, though, as open for business was my favorite expansion for the sims2
1259	1	Worth every penny, honest words
1260	0	It would be hard not to recommend something that you need in order to play playstation 4 games online (PS3 online multiplayer is still free). so... .... ... ... yeah, recommended.
1261	0	I've played just about every kind of f2p game there is, and gpotato is no exception, I've played various games from them, and they all usually follow the same kind of blan on going story, usually the same game engines used, the same scripts, and dialogues used, with simple and minor changes. It's kind of like making a Red T-shirt and a Blue T-shit out of the exact same materials, but trying to convince everyone that the blue is better than the red, or vice versa. It's completely opinionated. I've never had the benefit of Playing Allods online, mainly because when it first came out, it was pay to win, or pay to play, and because I'm usually always on a tight budget, as most Musicians and gamers are, I simply over looked it. But becuase I'm starting a new series on youtube, I decided to download and play this for a little while, at least until i get bored with it, or it just becomes ridiculous with the paying to get better armor than the next guy, or a better weapon that will completely own in pvp, and completely remove the talent, skill, and strategy out of pvp. I really don't have high expectations for Allods, nor any other gpotatoe game but everyone and everything deserves at least one try, maybe two. Hope I was of use to future down-loaders.<br /><br />EDIT: I've played it for about a week now give or take, and It's seeming more and more like a grind to achieve game, which is slowly putting me off from it, the features mention building an astral ship and such, but from what I've gathered you have to pay real money to build your ship, and the shop items seem legit except for the fact of having to buy a Mount, though if you link your amazon account you're supposed to get it as an exclusive thing, well I did get one, how ever, once I made a new character No mount, so they should say somewhere about the mount only being applicable to one character which is a bit of a put off.
1262	0	If you don't want hassle of online codes and steam and all that nonsense, this game is available in the mac app store. No steam or codes required!
1263	0	I bought this game a couple of years ago and just now got around to playing it.  At first I enjoyed it and found it entertaining enough.  But I soon tired of opening and closing doors and traversing from room to room and outbuilding to outbuilding.  On my pc it took a count of about 17 to complete the door opening process.  I quickly hated the prospect of going through another door only to engage in another pixel hunt.  It is a short game and I found I was almost finished after consulting a walkthrough because I just so badly wanted the game to be over.  And because I am an OCD kind of person I felt compelled to finish the game.  Aarrggh!  Also, one, maybe two, puzzles in the game were not logical.  Anyway, I finished.  I'd say the game is worth about $5.  You'd be wasting your money if you paid any more than that.
1264	-1	I am a long time COD player. I upgraded my system so that I would be able to play COD A W and for the past three weeks the multi player has been down. I don't play the single player mode so I feel like I haven't wasted my money.
1265	0	It was fun
1266	1	Just can not beat it...  purchased the card and used the credit within 30 minutes. Easy, fast... what could be better?
1267	0	I did not like this port of these 3 classic arcade games. My first reason is that it uses GamesForWindowsLIVE! GFWL is not only some of the worst game DRM ever invented but it is also being shut down in 2014. So as of 2014 you will not be able to play this online. My seccond reason is that you can not change the resolution. It has no widescreen support and you can not stretch the game to fit your monitor. Third is the high system reqirements. My higher end pc can run this but if you plan on running this on a netbook or something it will not run at all. Other than that it supports 360 controllers and the gameplay is nice.
1268	-1	I thought this game was pretty boring. I am sorry I wasted my money.  I love the china, they are my favorite.
1269	-1	There is very little instruction ..I tried for about a week to get into it and it just didnt happen
1270	1	Quick instant delivery. It's better to purchase and redeem these instead of having your credit card on file. Great alternative.
1271	0	The start of the game was so great!!! Then I got to a point where it became boring.  Maybe it was the never ending same scenery around you.<br /><br />Walking around the floating town or gliding on the same railways get boring.  Haven't beat it yet.  Played it NON stop for a 3-4 days.<br /><br />Got to a point where it got boring, went back to Battlefield 3.
1272	1	AmazIng game!! Exactly what I was hoping for. The new methods of possible assassination are many & varied. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE WHO WANT A TRULY AMAZING GAMING EXPERIENCE!!!
1273	1	its fairly simple,good at the price
1274	-1	It seems like it might be a fun game but it keeps freezing and closing so that you can't play for more than a couple of minutes.  It may be because I am using windows 8 and it was designed for Vista/XP/7
1275	-1	"I always liked the Sims type of games, but I hated some of the content in it, So I tried \\""My Sims\\"" a children's version. I was very disappointed, and wish I had never spent the money. It has seances,levitation,ghosts, etc. in it, and I do not allow anything that has to do with occult in my house. I do not recommend this for children, or anyone for that matter.     ElegantChicken.          [...]"
1276	1	This was very different. I enjoyed the hidden object scenes, and finding all the dolls to follow the story.
1277	0	I love being able to get online with my Xbox. I find it completely ridiculous that I have to pay to use the wifi I already pay for. But this is nice how the game code instantly goes to my email. Very convenient
1278	-1	It didn't seem to work well with my computer.  I downloaded it but the computer didn't seem to see it.  I rather play my games on the T.V.
1279	0	My son tried it and found that it was a co-op game & if you don't like those types of games like my son doesn't then this game is not 4 you.
1280	-1	Twisted Lands: Shadow Tower is your average point and click game.  The graphics are average at best the oldest computer can support this game.  Twisted Lands only costed $6.99 I'm not sure if that's even worth it.  If your bored senseless like I was(when I purchased this game) and have nothing else better to do with your time this may be the game for you.  But for $6.99 there are probably better alternatives out there.<br /><br />Reasons this game may appeal to you:<br /><br />You are 6yrs old and are learning how to read<br /><br />Stuck on an airplane for more than 3hours or airport or car......<br /><br />You cannot access your Itunes app store<br /><br />You cannot access your android app store<br /><br />You own a blackberry(I currently own one)<br /><br />You cannot sleep and you want something to wear you down mentally so you can just past out.<br /><br />Do not waste your $6.99
1281	-1	NOT THE GAME, ONLY ADD-ON
1282	-1	It's a farming sim. You plant and water and harvest and then sell in the market.  You can use some products to feed livestock and sell their produce in the market.  Rinse and repeat with boring graphics. The market is neat that the prices change and go down if you sell to much of one thing, but then all the prices will decline and your game will drag.  There are orders people place that request certain items in a certain timeframe.  Usually this means digging up and replacing a bunch of plants to meet the demand in time.  I played for a couple hours and haven't come back to the game since.
1283	0	I was very disappointed with this game. Simply because it stated it had all kinds of mini games and not the typical hidden object game. It does have mini games, but so simple its for grade school kids. And the entire basis is hidden object. I was bored after about 30 minutes, and the whole game took about 2 hours. Not worth the purchase to me.
1284	0	A
1285	1	This game is a great game if you like the Halo games.<br /><br />My only problem was with the pc down load took about 8 hours to download and you need a program called origin to run it. {Origin is free}
1286	0	what I expected.
1287	-1	I have been waiting over a year for this game. I preordered the imperial edition months in advance. Come launch day, I received an email to say my game may take a month or longer to receive and if it took more than that they would cancel my order. Why on earth would I preorder if I wanted to wait months after release?! I had to cancel, loosing all of my preorder perks. I bought the PC download just so I could play. Amazon did send me a $10 we're sorry credit, but it doesn't give me my preorder perks, art book, metal case, and statue back. I will NEVER preorder from amazon again. Very dissatisfied customer. But as for the game, I absolutely love it. Yes launch week has had bugs, but every game especially mmos do. They are patching like crazy to keep fans happy. Summing up, amazon, you suck, tamriel you are awesome!
1288	0	Anyone who has Steam should know about buying something that's on sale because it's cheap and you heard good things about it but then never really playing it. I got this played maybe 5 minutes of the game and then it's collected &#34;dust&#34; I should probably try actually playing it but I don't know when I will.
1289	1	Awesome...fast and convenient
1290	0	Fun game very colorful. it would be perfect if the the levels could be reached and then have more levels to conquer.  Like this game
1291	-1	I was really looking forward to playing this game, BUT before it could be installed, my VIPREWARE blocked it...saying it had a known virus...a Trojan. I sent an email to Amazon to see if I can get a credit, but haven't heard back as yet.    I don't know if the software is actually corrupted, but just in case, be careful!!!
1292	1	the game its self is awesome.  the only issue that cost it a star in my books is in game chat is not used as much as in every other mmo.  which in a way I like so I do not have to read through a thousand spams to get to one actual conversation.  other wise it is all there for a mmo.  no subscription.  the skill system is set up a little like secret world and border lands.  the shields and grenade mods work like borderlands as well.  I would sy this game is a mash up of borderlands mass effect and gears.  I am having a great time playing it. trion also took some from its other game rift.  dynamic events.  they are really fun.  they work just like rifts rift system.
1293	1	Very impressive game. I didn't want to download because of the reviews but the graphics are significantly better than a lot of other FPS games out there. I run 2 gtx680s on Sandy Bridge-e so I'm used to 70+ Frames on my 120hz monitor so if anything dips below that threshold I'm usually disappointed.<br />Graphics: Top notch<br />Gameplay: the controls are actually unique. Two different ways to peek outside of walls (either holding the alternate scope button and using a,w,s,d or pressing t,y so you don't have to scope. If using the latter, a simple modification of controls is all that is needed.<br />Audio: Sounds realistic and some weapons sound similar to those that I've fired.<br />Multiplayer: With BF3 being DICE's main multiplayer, this game isn't really focused on that. However, I have seen some clips and it's detailed enough to be interesting. Obviously it's not the same as BF3 but it's a change.<br />Storyline: Very real storyline and not your typical shooter. I loved how they emphasized different accents, as you could pinpoint the geographical origin of some of the characters, i.e. Boston.
1294	0	thanks
1295	1	Once I got it, played it for hours. Every time you go into it you learn something new. Can't wait for more upgrades.
1296	-1	My computer can play  Skyrim and other computer games - it's outfitted with Photoshop, but can't play Hoyle's games?  Wasted $5 :(
1297	-1	I bought this for an Xbox live deal but you can't buy Xbox live with this card
1298	0	Kind of irritated that after downloading this I had to still use my last used expansion pack cd, which I do not have anymore. This was a pointless download then...
1299	-1	... Just to watch Netflix, which I also pay for, through my XBox. There are no other useful features of XBox live to me. I don't play online, I just want Netflix streaming. Microsoft sucks.
1300	0	Yes, blah blah, there's a big twist at the end (that everyone sees coming from halfway in) but at its core, it's a first person shooter. And that's all. Entertaining, but not incredibly dynamic. It didn't hit me as emotionally as it hit some others, but to each their own.
1301	0	I'm no big gamer, I'm an old dude, I guess it's ok. I bought a joystick, and that makes a big difference.
1302	1	I bought this while it was on sale for 13.50. I Already had Skyrim and needed the DLC. If this goes on sale again and you're in my position, its cheaper than buying the DLC individually. It is redeemable with Steam and is very much worth it.
1303	1	I have a PS3 and this was simple to use. Just purchase, log into the PS store, redeem code, and enter the code given to you after the purchase. It installs the expansion quickly and you're set! So cheap too....
1304	1	Excellent game, great way to learn a bit of history and kill a few hrs.
1305	0	"Family fued is a classic and this version defintiely lives up to the tv version we all know and love. That being said, you get what you pay for. The game is fun to play and easy to understand, the main problem is that the question/answer combinations are kinda outdated. For example, one question asks \\""Which hollywood leading man would most women like to do a love scene with\\"" pretty straight forward, but answers like Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford may leave many women (like me) scratching their heads.   Bottom line, if you just want something cheap, quick and fun then this version is great but if you're a hardcore game show  or family fued fan then you might want to get an updated version."
1306	0	Can't redeem code! Disappointing! Will post a proper review when I can play!  Better buy [[ASIN:B00K59HKIQ $100 PlayStation Store Gift Card - PS3/ PS4/ PS Vita [Digital Code]]] from Amazon and order the games from PSN.
1307	-1	Really, me and my  5 friends that make the mistake to purchase this game... bad we cant back in the day we pre-ordered... the game is really bad...<br /><br />1 - its not optimized so well for pcs.... geforce gtx 690 and lots of fps problem<br />2 - the online mode is bad , bad , bad<br />3 - the single player , what a joke.<br /><br />Dont waste ur money whith this game.
1308	-1	Said I needed DVD to run kingdoms, which was why I bought in the first place.
1309	-1	I just purchased this game code and opened a Steam account and when I went to try to enter the code I had just been given at the cost of about $60.  I got a lovely error message that said the product code was invalid and had already been used.<br /><br />What am I suppose to do now…<br /><br />I know that amazon says you are not to (describe your seller or shipping experience) and you are to direct that stuff to their feedback page but it says i have no orders that I am able to give feed back on.  You would thing that the company who makes the game would be a reliable source.<br /><br />Love the game and would like to be able to play it...
1310	1	This game is about me building cities and ENEMIES TRYING TO BUILD NEXT TO ME AND HURT MY FEELINGS..................................then war
1311	0	This game almost works for me.  I think I'd like it better if the controls were on the keyboard rather than the mouse and if you got a larger view of the world.  I think you'd like it if you like playing Asteroids.
1312	1	excelente!
1313	-1	Origin is a terrible product and all the Sims games are very difficult to load.  I spent 6 hours updating everything on my computer, reinstalling Origin and doing all the other forum suggestions to get it to work. Now I've lost all my Sims games and nothing will work ever again.  Over $100.00 down the drain. EA support is non-existent.  Unless you are super techy game geek, stay away from all Sims games and Origin especially.  They are a nightmare to deal with.
1314	1	Tired of the new really-easy-to-play games?<br />Want to go back to the old school style?<br />This is your choice, you won't get disappointed about dying and for sure you'll learn all the enemies moves before fight them properly.<br /><br />Unfortunately the PC version requires a fix to work properly (look for Ds fix)
1315	1	it is so much Fun!
1316	1	Just like the video arcade game...only no feeding in quarters. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed arcade or Nintendo pac man.
1317	0	I think it works. It was just cheap enough that I forgot about it.
1318	-1	I don't know what they did, and it seems no matter what I do I can't fix it, but the game lags to the point of unplayability no matter what patches they release. It was a waste of $10 I should have just spent on Gold Edition.
1319	0	While I love Big Kahuna Reef, 1 and 2 seem the same.  Its basically a match 3 game with extra added challenges; some items are locked until you match those around them, etc.,  2 does have added bombs, which weren't in the first.  While this is a great game, so is the first, and since that one is on here for free right now I suggest getting that one and saving $.  They're too much alike to miss out on skipping the 2nd.
1320	-1	this game wouldn't install
1321	0	Well it's worth playing, but I needed to buy Advanced Warfare to really see the PS4's engine potential. Very jumpy story - Sledgehammer Productions handles this series a lot better
1322	-1	Down loaded 3 times and it never works not worth a nickel,never down loading a game again.bad idea too by
1323	1	The code works and the game itself is awesome, just that in terms of replayability isn't very high, unless you have a group of friends who are playing it regularly.
1324	0	That's really all that I can say about this title - it's another Sims game. If you're familiar with the Sims game engine and that's something you enjoy, it's a solid entry in the franchise... but don't expect it to be anything but another Sims game.
1325	-1	The Good: This game, as a series of the Runaway games are very good in graphics with a good doses of humor. The bad: The download version does not work without the DVD!! no matter what patch you use. You may need to burn a high density DVD (about 6 GB).
1326	1	I actually bought this for myself, and couldn't be happier to have my own version to play, rather than to have to play it some online version.
1327	-1	It's a simplistic, horribly written program. Modern phone apps are better written. A waste of money, you're better off buying a pet rock for entertainment.
1328	-1	After spending 2 hours installing this game it does not run.  Do not buy!
1329	-1	I bought this game through Steam as well as have this on my android.<br /><br />Both versions play the exact same way and have the exact same story. The major difference is that in the android is the only version with the extra content, the PC version does NOT and never will. I will only tell you the pros and cons of the game for this...<br /><br />PROS<br />=====<br />1.) Good story line<br />2.) Graphics are very good<br />3.) Gameplay is very well designed<br />4.) Lots of things to do outside the story<br />5.) Lots of items to purchase<br />6.) Lots of ships and upgrades<br />7.) Lots of locations to explore<br /><br />CONS<br />=====<br />1.) Game is too easy to beat<br />2.) A good player can beat this game in a few days<br />3.) As mentioned, this PC version has no extra content to get<br />4.) Only the Android version allowed you to purchase your own space station<br />5.) Only the android version had more locations to go to and find<br />6.) Although you can continue the game after you beat it, there's no point continuing<br />7.) Once you find everything and get it all, it's all done, nothing more to do<br /><br />Overall, paying $20 is too much for such a short game. Sadly there are better space simulator games out there, you are better off getting those than this version. If you really want to play this game, get the android version as it has more content than this PC version. Unless someone decides to make a mod to add on the extra content, there are no extras and there never will be extras for this PC version.
1330	0	a few issues but overall its good.  lots of projects to do.
1331	0	I was very excited about playing this game, and It truly Is a good game with a great story, great graphics, and good music, but there's a lot of problems with this game as far as running it on my PC. I have a pretty powerful computer, and I am getting very low frame rate, especially during cut scenes, or If I want to record the game is nearly impossible. Also screen tearing, audio out of sync, Seems like a lot of people are having the same problem, especially for non Nvidia cards like mine. I have a Radeon 6870. It's been at least 6 months since this game was released for PC, and these issues have still not been resolved yet. What's up with that ?
1332	-1	We waited over 2 years for this piece of crap? Game doesn't load, can't varify e-mail address, can't link to Guild Wars 1 Hall of Monuments and tech support is non-existent. Plus you are forced to navigate the map using the arrow keys! Did no one bother to tell them that the mouse still exists. I can't believe that I fell for this trap again! Everytime I wait for the sequel I get disappointed by companies who put out untested trash, just to take our money.
1333	1	....because, you will! I believe I got this via Amazon.com as a promotion and was free. Very fun game indeed.
1334	0	Call of Pripyat is a very ambitious game. I would have loved to see what the devs could have done with a AAA budget.
1335	-1	I was able to play this game 3 days before it stopped working.  I put it on two different computers.  Originally I was able to play on both computers no problem, but as of day 4 it won't load properly on either one. Please don't waste your money!
1336	-1	I have a pretty high end computer and whenever i try to run this game on max settings it keeps crashing. People keep telling me that it could be my GPU but im running a gtx geforce 780m on my asus g750
1337	0	"Once again you play Conrad, an Engineer who's lost his family. Your ship crashed into a derelict, most of the crew is killed, and you end up trying to stop from crashing into the atmosphere while fighting off \\""aliens\\"". You play as an isometric top down shooter, have 5 weapons that you find throughout the game, and finish objectives to fix the ship or get from one side of it to the other. Fully 1/3 to 1/2 of the time you flip a switch, lever, activate a console, etc. something will break necessitating you going on another series of waypoints to fix it.<br /><br />Camera, controls, and plot are all mediocre, though the effects are good. You're also quite often short on ammo, but do have a pistol that has unlimited and can take down most lone enemies just fine in a pinch. With a Metacritic score in the low 60s, mediocre kind of fits the game well.  This is part 3 of 3 parts, separated into three games only to be able to sell at a higher price.<br /><br />Things aren't all bad though, I did enjoy it enough to replay it some years after I bought it.  It's maybe a game you'd play an hour or two a day for a while, maybe less.  Then things don't seem quite so repetitive.  I don't want to sound too down on the game, it really isn't awful and there aren't that many games in the genre these days, but it has a lot of problems in its design and execution which mean there are better games out there."
1338	1	First off, the Original Is my favorite game of all time. I still like the original more, But this game is superior in some ways. And worse in someways.  Music 10/10: The music in the game is amazing, the best ambient music I've ever heard in a game. It's not like Deus Ex's soundtrack. But it equally compelling.  Graphics 6/10: The Graphics Are Poor, The art design is pretty amazing. The animations are pretty bad. Overall this is not a good looking game. Sort of like the predecessor when it was released.  Gameplay 9.5/10: Some things were improved. This game is much less clunky than the original. The shooting, sneaking, and general control of th character is much more smooth. There are some cool new augments like the jumping off buildings with the landing system. The Casie aug is pretty neat. However Making the skills and augmentations was a mistake. There's no melee, or swimming. There's seemed to bemore events where if you did something for a character, they'd repay you later in the game. Both games endings, were pretty bad.  Overall 9.5/10
1339	1	After performing the purchase, i received the code immediately (unlike some online stores where it takes some time, or even try to call you to verify your details).<br /><br />Overall, i've had a very positive experience with this product, as always with Amazon.
1340	1	simple- it works well. its's fast and easy and secure. I have nothing bad to really say about it! Thanks
1341	0	Love the 3 dimension but HATE having time limits.  And all the nonsense about diff levels....did it in 'x' amount of time...you're at this level now...who cares!  Just want to play the game w/o having to rush because of time
1342	-1	I hated this stupid game! On the YouTube video &#34;Game Sins | Everything Wrong With Thief In Fifteen Minutes&#34; they focused on all the details and not the overall failure of this game. They mentioned Garrett's eye being a different color and being able to see in the dark. They obviously aren't fans or would have known that Constantine/Trixter stole it in The Dark Project and the Hammers fabricated him the mechanical one you see now.  However, the real sin of this game is that it simply ISN'T a &#34;Thief&#34; game. Nothing about it is familiar except Garrett's name and Basso the Box man. The city is void of Hammer's, Mechanist, and Zombies. The story line doesn't pull you in the way the first 3 games did and lacks the &#34;Thief&#34; feel too it. I agree about the load screens and how annoying they aren't since many of them didn't lead to anywhere exciting and speaking of exciting THAT is exactly what this game truly lacked...excitement. The first 3 games kept you wanting more. More of the story as well as the action. The story in this game was almost non-existent since you didn't really care about it to begin with because it was meaningless. I wish they would have employed writers or consultants from the first 3 games to collaborate on this one. I also hated the herky-jerky playing like every time I took down a guard with my black jack the game would freeze up for a while or if there was a lot going on in the screen shot the game would slow down and jerk around. But overall the game possessed that same lifelessness that turned me off to Dishonored. This Thief game to me has a lot of similarities to that one. As a matter of fact I quit and uninstalled this Thief game after the idiotic and endless &#34;running through the burning city&#34; fiasco that had nothing to do with the spirit of the Thief games. This game was soooo disappointing because so much of this game lacked what Thief fans expected which was simply...another “true” Thief game. Maybe Eidos should have focused more on the story and character development while remaining true to the genre then a bunch of lame graphics and effects that added absolutely nothing to this game. But then again...what can you expect from a bunch of Canadians. ;)
1343	0	"I played the game and enjoyed it pretty much. It was different. The ending was rather lame. I expected the last level to be much harder and \\""dangerous\\"", but it went really quickly and was over before I knew it. I don't know if I will play it again for quite awhile, tho."
1344	-1	This was the first stuff pack I bought and it wasn't worth the money, I bought it to try it out and see if I liked the stuff packs. I don't. You get a bunch of nothing for a whole lot of money.
1345	0	This unlocks each and every piece of vehicle in-game, spoiling all the fun of obtaining them through gameplay. This feature cannot be disabled after using the activation code.
1346	1	Great
1347	-1	I hate STEAM.. can never make it work.. Will not buy games that use it in the future..
1348	1	So convenient getting the code in this form verses waiting for it to come in the mail. Would definitely buy this way again.
1349	-1	'Stand O'Food' comes across as a time-management games, but in all actuality is a puzzle game instead. Now, I have played a great many programs thus far by Alawar Games, but I have to say that this one was a great disappointment. For one thing, it is almost TOO FAST for gameplay. The graphics look like someone had almost colored the screen with a crayon and then sat back and said 'hey, let's SELL this!'. If you're going to create a program such as this, make it a little more plausible. For instance, make it a little easier to get what you need. I mean, twenty bucks for a coffee pot for your stand is a little ridiculous, considering that you're making pennies on the dollar after each level. While that may be true in real life, this is a GAME! I know there are two more, and maybe I may take the time to check those out. But this one is a real stinker!
1350	0	What can I say, bought this as a pre-order based on the 'gameplay footage' released a while back.<br />The game is NOWHERE near as good as it was promised, I will happily say we were all conned with this one as it was mega over-hyped.<br />That said and done, after all the massive patches this game isn't too bad.<br />I will strongly recommend no-one pays anywhere near full price for this though as not worth it, if you see this on offer then it's worth getting.<br /><br />AI is better after patch, much harder. Graphics/textures are supposed to be improved from recent patches but can't really see it personally.<br />Running with AMD 8350 cpu and AMD 7870 OC gfx card.
1351	-1	I bought this hoping that i could get right into the game. I purchased this 3 days ago.. still havent got to play this. The game starts up just fine however it does not show up on my screen, i have unistaled and re-downloaded it several times and also contacted steam and amazon and even deep silver support and amazon was the only one to reply in which they said, sorry we dont have enough detail to fix the problem. i have a new Dell computer like maybe a week old with windows & and a dual core processer. i have adjusted my resolution many times to hopefully get something on the screen, and still nothing. this was the biggest waste of 39$ Never purchasing downloadable content from amazon again. Thanks for taking my money.
1352	-1	I was not able to completely install Civ 4 on a laptop running Windows 8, which I don't care for very much in the first place. I am able to play Colonization and enjoy that very much but I'm not going to waste a lot of time on re-installing the rest of it. I'll just wait until I can get a Windows 7 OS on a different computer.
1353	-1	Same old same old,maps are far to big,lag all the time,rubbish hit detection is very poor,hopefully treyarch will release a new and revamped game but highly doubt it,get bf4 instead
1354	-1	I thought game play would be more like the Trine series, alas no it was not.  I found this game to be clever in some of the writing, but not worth the $15 I spent on this one.
1355	0	The split view gaming and controlling two different characters can be difficult. However it's not a bad game overall. Enjoy playing it with my son.
1356	1	The best way to purchase game card without leaving home, and it works great..
1357	0	This is ok but I'm very bore with this game cd
1358	0	The dragons aren't as neat as I thought they would be, in fact compared to pets they are pretty stupid.  The armor is okay though
1359	0	Super easy, worth a little entertainment.
1360	-1	I could never get it to work tried several time just wasted my money need a refund I heard it does not work with windows 7
1361	-1	This game is almost unuseable in Windows 8 environment. This was not stated in the specs because I would not have purchased it. I have looked for patches and updates for error message. So far, even the original manufacturer has not attempted to fix the problem. Will not load the game consistantly and will stop functioning 3 out of 4 times I attemot to load it. Also, it does not save the games either so be prepared to finish each park before you quit.
1362	0	it was ok
1363	-1	A bug in the PC version ruined it. The button just wont respond in mine when I try to hack something, no matter what the key binding is set to. You have to use hack to pass that part in the game, so unfortunately, I couldn't play any farther. I was so mad. No wonder this game was on sale for $4.99, I guess something had to be wrong with it. Shame on Amazon if they put it on sale because it had a bug that doesnt allow you to finish the game, great way to piss off a lot of people.
1364	1	Aewsome!.....Epic! The end!
1365	-1	did not get to play the unlock code was a steam code and according to steam someone already had this code so never worked for me
1366	-1	after reading the reviews of the game, i thought i would love it. maybe i didn't give it enough time? 2 weeks? i could not get past the building over and over and over. myself i saw no point in the game. you have to build this and that to make your people happy, but no end was ever in sight.
1367	0	This was a fun puzzle, seek & find game.     I've never played one like this before so I don't have any experience to compare it to.    The only complaint was that it was too short.  I played through it in  one evening.  Then they want you to play through it again and again to  see if you can get a higher score.  DUH! of course you've already solved  all the puzzels before so its easy to do it again.  Where's the fun in that?  There's no more mystery.  Things are hidden sometimes in diffrent places, but not reaLLY ALL THAT DIFFRENT.
1368	-1	I was a big fan of BF2 and earlier series.<br /><br />It started out well, but the network connectivity became an unfixable problem lately.  I tried all the suggested workarounds, such as turning off uPNP, Port Forwarding, turning off firewalls, etc.  And I'm not the only one.  I'm not a corner case.<br /><br />Totally unplayable.<br /><br />EA, I'm extremely disappointed that a known bug that's been around since 2011 has STILL not been addressed.  Networking has been around for more than a decade and you still can't get it right?  Other gaming companies don't struggle like this.  Unacceptable.<br /><br />Sure, the Single Player is kind of playable, but since everybody plays BF3 for the online experience that's not enough to raise it to 2 stars.
1369	-1	I bought the game from Origin but I also experienced constant crash to desktop, sound disappearing, sound loop crash.<br /><br />I got a refund from Origin a month after. ( It took them that long)
1370	1	This is a fun game.  It is open world pursue this quest, collect 12 of these widgets, go see this guy, kind of game (think WOW single player).  Interesting story and quest lines.
1371	-1	I tried to play the game after download and installation and all I get is a Disc Authentication Error which is ridiculous being that it wasn't downloaded from a disc. I've tried uninstalling Origin and the game and nothing has worked. Biggest waste of money. The fact that they won't refund it is a gigantic scam.
1372	1	I was worried this would be too retro.  Plays great and all the levels were concurred in a couple days.  The replay is bumping up the skill level ... great for increasing reaction time.  I need to learn to read titles better I was actually looking for a code not the download .  Like having all my games in one place BUT if one provider disappears I guess the other baskets will be nice.
1373	0	while I have not played the game I thought it worth mentioning the game will soon be avalible on Xbox one
1374	1	Amazing Game 5 Stars. Ignite game engine is so beautiful.
1375	1	Fun game. Finished it a little too quickly though.  Definitely worth checking out if you enjoy Farming type games :)
1376	-1	I wanted to play it but it did not work
1377	1	I love these things. The only way to improve this would be to give me one worth $21 dollars...
1378	-1	I placed an order and it said that it was processing but i checked my e-mail and still no confirmation e-mail
1379	1	So good. better than the first game and so addictive. I really live this game. And they made sure not to make it easy.
1380	1	This is a pretty good game. It is fun to play and really fun online. I really wish they didnt use games for windows live though. it ruins the fluidity of the game. it is fine and dandy until you have to log in and go through a whole bunch of crap just to play campaign!!!!!!!!!!!! take out games for windows live and this game would be 5 stars.
1381	0	I played it for the full 30 day trial and I've owned it about 3 months now, I just didn't pay for a subscription. Since I'm on Amazon, I'll leave my feedback for it. The game has nice graphics in a sense, the gameplay is fluid but it's too much of the same thing that's already been experienced hundreds of times through various of other free to play and pay to play MMO's that are in the genre at this exact moment. What I mean is; same dungeon concept, same leveling concept, same partying concept, nothing new, nothing flashy... nothing worth subscribing for.<br /><br />Granted the game has a unique and different version of crafting, it's still nothing out of the ordinary, especially if you are a casual gamer and don't want to spend hours of your day trying to gain even 5-levels of crafting.<br /><br />There's random events called FATE's which are able to be done by anyone in the area, with an ability to sync the level down and do them with people in that areas level; but again, FATE is just another word for 'grind'. There's 1-time doable quests for the story line, repeatable leve-quests (granted you only can do a certain amount per day, each 8hours you earn the ability to do 3, stacks up to 99), and the only way to level with a friend if you out level them is to grind dungeons & FATE's.<br /><br />I think the most unique thing that FFXIV:ARR offers is the ability to level each and every class/job on one character. This means make one character and they are all doable on that one specific; and the ability to use some abilities during the use of a different class (with limitations of course). However, since quests for the story line are done once and then done, and the only repeatable quests are given 3 charges per 8 hours, this greatly limits what can be done, which means that 90% of the leveling process of leveling your &#34;alt&#34; class/job will come from FATE grinding and dungeon grinding.<br /><br />All in all, out of a 5, I rated this a 3, because it's simply &#34;okay&#34;, it's not something totally unique and awesome. The concepts have been seen before, the new concepts are not awe-inspiring and the idea of paying a subscription for the game is tedious -- note that there are no major discounts for anyone that now purchased the game, for monthly gametime, the major discounts were given to people who were grandfathered in from previously playing the original FFXIV, all you will save if you purchase now is a mere $12 per year, for a 1-year subscription flat out; as the payments are lower the more time you purchase -- that means $12 cheaper than say... World of Warcraft, yearly, if bought in a 1-year package. Month to month, the price is the same as every other pay to play, $14.99.<br /><br />I do not recommend this game, it's been done before, and done better.
1382	0	I finished this game last week and was really disappointed.<br />I took some time to think about it and I realized it's because I feel like the core of the Bioshock name wasn't there.<br /><br />The graphics and game play were beautiful and the story was great but for me a big part of Bioshock is CHOICES.<br />The whole good vs evil, having several different things you can do and it changing your path and your ending because of that.<br />It also meant there could be many variations of the game and lots of different small things.<br /><br />Another consequence of this was that replay value was removed totally for me - I played Bioshock & Bioshock 2 and their many different options, which have easily spanned over 20 hours game play each.<br />This one I finished within 10 hours. Knowing that the story will no longer be a surprise and that there aren't any significant choices I can make that will alter the game...well I will pass.<br /><br />I feel like this game was 'Bioshock' but a huge part was stolen from it.<br /><br />Overall it is good value - It cost me around $6 an hour to play which is still less than a movie these days. However it wasn't great value for the Bioshock label and what many have come to expect from it.<br /><br />Very sad.
1383	0	it was ok
1384	1	I really enjoy the hitman series. Since the first game, this one hits an amazing graphics an a simple system. And if you still like the challenges from stealting gender, this game still perfect  for this. I highly recommend !!
1385	-1	http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GXM48HA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br /><br />I expected the game Battlefield 4 Premium.<br /><br />If they were selling a gift card should they have sold a &#34;GIFT CARD&#34;?<br /><br />I thought I was buying my son Battlefield 4. That's what the picture shows & this was the 1st hit when I searched for Battlefield 4. I paid $50 & it turns out that this purchase had nothing to do with Battlefield 4. it was simply a $50 gift card for XBox. He tried to use it to purchase Battlefield 4 Premium since that's what I told him I bought him, & it turns out that he couldn't because after tax, he didn't have enough money. I had to buy an ADDITIONAL $10 gift card (total now at $60 for this game) so he could purchase it. He did & then found out that it wasn't the actual game, it was only an expansion pack. The game cannot be downloaded & I then had to spend $40 on eBay for the CD of Battlefield 4. $100 later, he won't have the game until a week from now & then has to spend an additional day downloading the expansion pack. I just wanted to buy him Battlefield 4 & had I known then what I know now, it would have been $40 at a local store & been done already. :( This was very deceiving. A plain gift card that cannot be used to purchase Battlefield 4 (since it can't be downloaded AND this card wasn't enough (with tax) to cover the purchase anyway if I were intending to purchase only the expansion pack) should NOT have come up in a search for Battlefield 4 & even worse, it shows a picture of Battlefield 4 instead of ONLY a gift card picture, which I would have skipped over & scrolled until I found the actual game. Battlefield 4 should have come up in a search for Battlefield 4!
1386	0	I don't really play AQW all that much and I received this for free alongside the purchase of a game subscription for another MMO. It looks cool and is unique, but the stats are lacking and really serves no purpose other than advertising for AQW (and by extension, Amazon when someone asks you what you are wearing).
1387	0	"I just downloaded this recently. It seems like it is good for learning but it may be a little boring. There are no bright interactive bells and whistles to keep a restless child interested. I was hoping for more, something that almost made them forget they're learning and really engage the game...sort of like scribblenauts does. It may work for a child who likes crossword puzzles and brain activities, puzzle style without the \\""background\\"" amusements.<br /><br />Oh well, 9.99 wasted as far as that goes. I'll probably be less likely to download anything else for pay, especially when there are so many games available for free on the web.<br /><br />I will update if I see any changes or feel my comments are unfair."
1388	1	This was one of my most anticipated games, and I was not disappointed.  The combat in this game is the best I've ever tried.  I found the story interesting and I really enjoyed developing relationship with the characters.  I was so looking forward to the MMO that they were working on as well.  Seeing them close down and all of those people lose their jobs was very sad.  This game however is totally worth it at $60 (what I spent), but even better at $40.
1389	0	I've had this game about 2 months now. So far- not so good. It was one of the first HOG I'd played in awhile, so I thought maybe it was just me. There is no map, and the hint function is about useless. Right now, I'm stuck. I wonder how many peeps have gotten past the elevator area. I've asked that question & hoping someone has. But I just haven't much good to say about it!
1390	1	Great product and the price is right on Amazon is the place to go for any xbox accessories  gaming needs
1391	1	good
1392	-1	I love this game! So why 2 stars? Because it is inherently incompatible with Windows 8. There are a number of workarounds, but none of them are guaranteed to work. None have for me so far. Hours of attempts, reinstalls, mod-patches, etc and it still doesn't work. I'm just glad I got it on sale, so I'm only out a few dollars.
1393	1	It's always refreshing to get a brand new game that is so enjoyable. This game looks and sounds beautiful, and will stimulate your mind in a unique way. The price is slightly higher than the average XBLA game, but don't let that stop you. This game is worth it.<br /><br />The level design is very clever, and you (the player) have to be even more clever in figuring it out. Spend the extra time figuring it out on your own and the reward is even greater.  The game starts out simple enough but quickly becomes surprisingly clever and unique. So if you are looking for a unique experience that is both exciting and relaxing, do not hesitate and get this game.
1394	1	They are great games, and the sale offered them at a fantastic price. I've already played through the first one, and I can't wait to move on to the others.
1395	-1	Cities are too small, the multiplayer is absurd, it's just an excuse for DRM, downloadable content is a &#34;Pay to Win&#34;, Electronic Arts destroyed the game, i will not buy &#34;The Sims 4&#34; is probably more crap.
1396	1	There's no reason for not to buy it. It's all the same Plus experience, at lower cost.<br />Simply buy it!!!
1397	1	A good game reminiscent of the original. Intriguing cast and though the plot doesn't break much ground the effort to bring the player through more than a game, through an experience, shows how much effort went into it. Like many games coming out of late, this game is more about experiencing a story and having fun while at the same time be intrigued by the unfolding of events. Good job Eidos Montreal.
1398	1	Very fun game
1399	1	The most awesome game in the last years.
1400	0	this game is just ok for me
1401	1	First of all it looks Great, and the action packed experience is Great.<br /><br />Only Down side is you need a fairly high end Computer to run it...<br /><br />A Must Play for every Hardcore Gamer..
1402	-1	I would love to write a review for the game itself however I cant even play the game. Apparently the game is written in such a way that if you have an antivirus software program running like zonealarm the game won't open. Even if you disable it or close it it still won't open. The game programmers know this and thier Work around is to unistall your anivirus program and the game opens fine. I can't even believe that they would think that is an acceptable work around. I am very disappointed that I spent money on this crap, and I will have to consider buying anything from this publisher again which is sad as I really loved thier Tropico games.<br /><br />So if your looking at this game you need to turn around and run, run away fast.
1403	1	Its cool
1404	-1	the little fairy helper, annoying! it was very boring, which was disappointing to a gamer, but I really didn't like the sequel either! so not happy about the price for it sad day
1405	1	Since getting older have found this Hidden Objects games to be enjoyable.  This is the best one yet.  Had soooo many games and I have yet to finish them all.
1406	1	The garage graphics are Super, outside views are quite passable, realistic in many ways.  I'm more into easy to play and good backgrounds, scenery.  I'm nearly 70, so that's probably the reason.  I cracked my first PC in 1982, an old IBM 8086 AT.  I have been building and configuring PC's since then.  The units I play on are self built, so I am more interested in the software that I want, not have to adjust to. (or rewrite)
1407	0	Pros: Graphics, Sandbox shooter, various killing machines, &#34;true-life feel&#34;<br /><br />Cons: In my opinion, the maps are sometimes too big. You can get hit from almost anywhere. It is more realistic, but also annoying.
1408	0	I suppose it was worth the .. what... $2.99 I paid for it?<br />I've played through a few levels.... I wish you didn't have to play certain things to unlock layouts and levels... but meh. It gives me something to do.<br />If you are really bored, then give this game a try. It's  not bad.
1409	1	Arrived in my email inbox in seconds and worked as I would expect it to.
1410	-1	lame
1411	0	As  advertised
1412	0	its ok
1413	-1	it don't load at all it wont let me play it it says command invalied so can I please get a re fund
1414	1	Good and challenging game.
1415	1	"This is a classic game which was (even at the time) a throwback to old-school mindless shooters.  Games at the time were getting more intricate with Experience Points, multiple objectives, item collection and so on.  So, Serious Sam came along with the intention of bringing back the style of classic games like Doom, Wolfenstein, and Quake.. but Serious Sam is SERIOUSLY harder than any of those games by a factor of hundreds.<br /><br />When I first started playing this game, I hated.. HATED it.  I was unprepared for the sheer amount of enemies and the irritatingly infuriating patterns of some of the monsters.  You see, I always play games on Hard.. so I started this one on hard.  Hard, by the way is not the hardest difficulty here.  Anyway.. by about the 3rd or 4th level, I was extremely stressed out and angry at trying to progress through certain rooms.  It seemed impossible to me, so I turned it off and figured it was money down the drain.<br /><br />However, I picked it back up the next day and noticed that I was slowly getting better, which gave me drive to complete it.  By the end, I was pretty good at it.  It was nice to be able to feel my skills improving over the course of the game, and I grew to love this game for the most part.  Unfortunately, there are some sections of the game that are literally among the hardest things I've ever tried to accomplish in life.  I call these the \\""F.U. rooms\\"" because when I get to them, it feels like the developers are saying \\""F.U. for trying to enjoy this game!\\""  It can be extremely frustrating and stressful at times, but there is, fortunately, more good than bad.  The Second Encounter is much better than this one due to there not being as many \\""F.U. rooms\\"" and the addition of some new and VERY helpful weapons like the flamethrower and the sniper rifle.  I recommend playing all of the SS games, but be warned.  They are quite sadistic at times, and this one is the worst offender."
1416	1	I bought this game back in the day for 50 dollars, paid 20 for each expansion after that when they released at gamestop, then stopped playing for a few years, decided to get back on and see what was new and had a very hard timw trying to purchase a new copy from square enix, looked here after 3 hours of trying to buy it from them, found the game, and all expansions for direct download and it was 5 dollars. Game works great, download took about an hour which is good for an 8gb + game. Thanks amazon!
1417	1	works just they way it says it does
1418	-1	The code thus not work
1419	-1	Sadly, I could not get this game to install, and Amazon was more than helpful working out a return--despite it being a download
1420	1	This was not one of my favorite nancy drew games because I thought the puzzles and stuff were harder than others, but it was fun.
1421	-1	This thing crashes and disconnects ALL THE TIME.  For $50-60 bucks you think you would get a stable product.  I'm never buying another battlefield game again.  EA and Dice have lost a customer.
1422	1	This was a great game! It was fun, challenging, and had some fun stealth parts too. I would recommend playing this game.
1423	0	It's basically the same couple of card games over and over. Was kind of fun at first and the graphics were pretty good, but more of a time waster. I hoped there would be more to it.
1424	-1	Very difficult game. Spend literally hours learning the moves. Kind of disappointing. After hours trying to learn a wall jump fingers hurt.
1425	-1	The mouse does not work in game, so it is nearly impossible to work through menus.
1426	1	Very good
1427	1	Fast, and easy. I want buy more two gift card in amazon cause deliverie it's so fast. And I want More.
1428	0	its a subscription....works
1429	1	"[Reviewed after several months of gameplay.  My copy of the game was not purchased through Amazon.  I'm following Amazon's rule against using external URLs in this review.]<br /><br />The summary given in the Amazon listing is accurate but terse.  Those who want more information before buying can visit the company's site, and there are hours of gameplay shown in readily available videos.  To quote the company:  \\""In InFlux you play as a mysterious metal sphere which falls from the sky, traversing an island populated by cubic structures of glass and steel. Each glasshouse is a puzzle to be solved.\\""<br /><br />The game includes an option to listen to pleasant hypnotic music.  The island landscape is quite pretty, and includes an exotic underwater cave system.  With the music, the beautiful island landscape, the puzzles, and the barest hint of a plot, I find the game to be similar to [[ASIN:B00023XXMC Myst Uru]], although Influx is on a much smaller scale.  If you enjoyed Uru you might enjoy this game.<br /><br />Most components on my computer date back to 2011, and it can usually manage 30+ FPS (Frames Per Second) at the highest settings.  However, gameplay occasionally slows to a crawl as I move from one game area to another--presumably as a huge database of polygons is loaded to my graphics card.  I'm playing on a machine with 12 GB memory, a Core i7-870 processor, a [[ASIN:B00E3W1726 250 GB Samsung 840 EVO SSD]], and an [[ASIN:B004123HNA Asus GTS450 Graphics Card]].<br /><br />I did not find the game difficult, and it would not be worth playing more than a few times if it weren't for the fun of exploring the landscape.  There are innumerable hidden areas and \\""cheats\\"" to be found, many of them being bugs that the developers hadn't planned on.  These are what keep me coming back.<br /><br />I'm taking one star off my rating because:<br /> - There is no real \\""save game\\"" feature, although the game occasionally makes a \\""checkpoint\\"" that can be returned to;<br /> - The bugs that I find so entertaining can also trap you so that you need to go back to the checkpoint;<br /> - My copy of the game (but perhaps not the version sold by Amazon) must be run in administrator mode;<br /> - My copy of the game seems to go online to contact some server, although I don't allow my firewall to let the communication go through.  This does not seem to influence the gameplay."
1430	1	Best Price ever!<br />I recommend to all who want a fast shipping code!<br />It worked perfectly!<br />Best Way to buy Gift Card!
1431	1	Everything was perfect
1432	1	My husband had the 08 game on disc, but wore it out.  We were so pleased to be able to download the game, as the Madden games are no longer available for the computer and my husband does not like using X-Box (too complicated.)  I wish EA Sports would again offer the game for computers, as the players have changed somewhat and there are many new players, which he cannot play.
1433	0	Graphics and sound are truly the best but the basic game was $59.00 then Premium which is most of the maps was another $59.00 so its really a game over 100 dollars in cost. Secondly they cant stop the cheaters. Ive gone up against hacks on virtually every map and it ruins the game. They dont or wont stop them. If the hacking persists in Battlefield 4 they can keep it.
1434	1	Really good I loved it
1435	0	So I didn't pay very much for this game, only a couple bucks. And I would say I got a couple bucks' worth of entertainment out of it. I really like the premise - you are living the life of a renaissance citizen in one of a number of professions, working your way through the societal ranks of your village, acquiring wealth and family members along the way. It's an RPG of sorts but combat plays a very small part.<br /><br />The game suffers from a lack of polish that patches evidently have not fixed even years after its publication. There is multi-language support, evidenced by the fact that characters you speak to will slip from English into German from time to time, often switching from male to female or vice versa at the same time. The graphics are fine but the camera can be sketchy sometimes, making you disappear or doing other strange things.  To me this game represents the best and worst of small game publishers. You get high concept, interesting ideas, but a lot of bugs and rough edges to deal with as well.
1436	-1	Would not download.
1437	-1	Compared to the first Puzzle Quest, this game is an expensive letdown that messes with the original formula too much.
1438	1	Awesome game but it's a pain in the butt.
1439	-1	How long did it take the studios to catch-up to COD4 PC users? They’ve had AI Bots and Castle maps for years! Sure the Stonehaven Castle map is a long needed breath of fresh air from freight yards, slums, and destroyed towns. But COD4 mp-burg is far superior with its battlements and tunnels. You’re not kidding anyone here studios, we know the creative talent has long left the building...<br /><br />So I ask this of the Infinity Ward / Treyarch guys: Why not be brave and set the next game somewhere new? How about China ... The Great Wall, Leshan Park / Big Budda, Longman Grottos, Hong Kong, Shangri-la... Don’t like that idea? Then how about Italy: Venice, Florence, Rome, Monselice, Italian Alps? Don’t like any of those? Then how about Japan or Dubai? Either way folks, treat yourselves to a little world travel, you definitely have the resources. But please no more Ghosts of Christmas Past…
1440	-1	Have no reason to post any thing about it.  It for people  who don't care to work and sleep all day and live off others.
1441	0	This game isn't too bad, and it's a decent bit like Team Fortress 2 (even in the team color choice). It has a decent class-based system, but it just isn't that fun. The Co-op is probably the funnest part, but there is never anyone playing it (let alone the actual multiplayer). This game may have been decent when it came out, but the community is practically totally dead, save your money and buy something else.
1442	-1	FORGET ABOUT IT!!
1443	-1	I believed I was ordering a keurig coffee maker and it redirected me to pay on Amazon for the gift card. I never received the giftcard. I called Amazon and requested my money back but they said , &#34;It's a done deal.&#34; Supposedly it was a scam.  Please check on this so you do not have any more unhappy customers. I will be very cautious should I ever order from Amazon again.
1444	0	I don't know why,this item seems everyone of my friends(included me)got payment problems,pending for a long time.this make me feel bad.<br />In the other side,i love this pack~
1445	0	After it took me forever to download and sign up for everything when i launch it it just stops and shows EFLC fatal error, then something with directx, can someone please help!
1446	0	It's pretty fun and different from M&B: Warband, but seems really stripped down as well. It felt more like an incomplete mod for Warband.
1447	1	Worked perfect
1448	-1	I purchased this product to get some things I needed in the game and to enjoy some of the benefits of being a Premium user. What I didn't realize was that adding this to the game would add hours to log into the game. After applying the card to my account, I am now presented at each and every login with a request for a One Time Password. This can take up to 30 minutes to arrive in my email and by then the password has expired and will not work. I then have to close the launcher and start over. To access customer service to question this process also takes a One Time Password and I have yet to receive that one in time to allow me open a Customer Service request. If this continues, I am going to ask for a refund of the purchase price.<br /><br />Do not, under any circumstance, purchase any product like this for an EA game, and certainly do not subscribe, until they correct this issue.
1449	0	While I've enjoyed the game, I'm really frustrated about Amazon's bonus offer, which was increased from 5 card packs and a 7 day token to 15 packs and 4 seven day tokens. It makes me feel angry for having signed up a few days too early (just over a week ago). It doesn't look like there's anything you can do about it.<br /><br />As people have already reviewed, to do well in this game you need to use cards, and the extra 10 packs would make a huge difference.<br /><br />The gameplay is addictive but that's not necessarily a good thing if it glues you to the screen. They've geared the game so you 'need' to load it up every 12 hours to get your 'free' card. The strategy is oversimplified but the core of this game is the teamwork. There are a lot of good playable hours in this game, and the Firefly team keeps adding new cards and new functionality to the game.
1450	0	love the game, but going back and forth from car to car gets a little old and some of the puzzles are tedious and long. the storyline could be better, and the characters could be a lot more divergent. wish there was more dialogue too.
1451	1	Excelent.
1452	-1	game became frozen had to delet
1453	-1	You log in to Steam each time you want to play the game.  I went back to my old copy of the disk fighting the &#34;insert disk&#34; problems.
1454	-1	The game is great. Except that I cannot save my games because everytime I login to Windows Live it says my product key is invalid. Amazon has been little to no help after 15 days of not being able to use my game I purchased from them. They won't even refund it. So basically they told me they don't know what to do. They just &#34;sell the game&#34;, apparently that gives them no responsibility as a retailer to serve their customers. Let alone a couple day's after I paid $15.00 for the game it goes down to $10.00. Can't even through me the $5.00 difference. This is the first time I had trouble with a product from them. I shop on here a lot but after this I'm not buying from here again and closing my account. What good is it to buy from someone who doesn't back what they sell?
1455	1	Downloaded it onto my laptop and was extremely laggy, but made it work for the most part. So now its on a desktop and it is pretty fun. Not the best simulator but I enjoy playing it. The trucks and such don't have American names (German I think) but all the instructions are in English. Also another thing I like about the game itself is it is sandbox. You can hangout at the FD or drive around as you please as you wait for calls to come in and having to fill with gas and water are also another realistic touch.<br /><br />To summarize, fun to pass the time with and almost realistic. Give it a 80%...
1456	0	If you love tower defense games, there are better ones available on PSN: namely, PixelJunk Monsters. Besides having a local co-op mode and better trophies, it's art style holds up better graphically. There's nothing stopping Savage Moon from looking great, but it gets even worse when the camera zooms in on a location. The sound doesn't give any kind of really satisfying or enveloping surround effects during attacks or explosions.    If a future patch adds co-op and/or enhances the quality of the textures, shaders, and audio I'll update my review. Until then, get PixelJunk Monsters instead.    Not Recommended.
1457	-1	Will not work on Win 7,  And Alawar entertainment response was &#34;we no longer support that product.&#34; Yet you can find it for sale at multiple websites.
1458	1	It was a very great series in my opinion, even though stronghold 2 and stronghold legends weren't as great as stronghold and stronghold crusader. I loved playing them until i eventually forgot about them.
1459	0	Fun, but not very realistic as far as the &#34;sim&#34; part of the game should be concerned.  Developers should focus on more realistic vehicle reactions in a realistic setting.  Driving is choppy.  Movements choppy, and designed like 18 WOS.
1460	-1	i really dont no how to rate this product due to the fact that i didnt know amazon wont let soldier download games while overseas fighting for their country. so i wasted how much eer i spent on it for nothing!!!!!! very upset soldierright here!
1461	1	Would've given it 5, but:<br />-I can't see the loading screen?<br />-Kept crashing until I figured out a way around it..<br /><br />Other than that, an awesome EP, lots of activities and things to do to keep the game from ever being too monotonous or boring. Always something new to do or play with. Personally, the imaginary friend just gets on my nerves, but the fact they even thought of that is awesome and it builds on the child imagination/creativity thing they have through the whole EP. Lots of role playing and playing in general for kids, and teens are ok. Like I said, great game and probably my fave so far.
1462	0	I had problems with seeing the whole screen. I had to move the screen around to see the musicians on one side and the coffees on the other side couldn’t see both together. But the upgrades were nice.
1463	0	I'd prefer not to have to use steam to play a game that I bought. I'd rather have it on my PC and not have to log on to an online site to play. The game is great so that's why I rated it only 3 stars.
1464	1	good game
1465	0	this game is very nice. I love the game play. but it seems to be very glitchy. it crashes a lot and freezes all the time.
1466	-1	Rip off took over night to download.  Then the next morning when we tried to play it said that it would take 2hrs & 40 min to load the game to play.
1467	0	fast shipping product as described
1468	1	Been playing this one for years but lost it when my laptop took a dive. Made my day when I found it on Amazon. Thanks!
1469	-1	really boring after a few games. Too hard to learn, and if one did learn it, it would consume ones life. As for this particular game, it didn't look like it was offering anything you haven't seen before. It is just a bunch of animated men jumping up and down. You'll find more strategy on a chess board, and chess leaves time for the rest of your life. Have fun!
1470	-1	This game has absolutely no structure whatsoever. I played about two days on the easy mode and I basically had to kill every enemy on each section just to get through. There is an orange marker that shows you where to go when the level first opens but it's easy to forget where to go. So I couldn't figure out where to go and when I found out how to make the orange marker appear I couldn't get there because the lights are so glaringly bright and each level is overrun with enemies. I kept getting killed by enemies I couldn't see, I kept thinking what the hell this is on easy mode! Some levels have no orange dot to look for and even on the ones that do I couldn't figure out what to do when I got there. Sure you can turn down the contrast, then you can't see anything. I thought this game was supposed to be a 9/10 for playability and graphics. However I gave it a 2/10 because it sucks so badly, I had to stop myself from just breaking the disc into. I can't stand it anymore. I'm trading it in as soon as I can. It's got my vote for the worst game for the PS4!<br /><br />*EDIT*<br /><br />The more I play this game the easier it becomes but I still don't like normal mode because you die too easily. I still have to kill all enemies to get through the levels. And the background lights are still very harsh so it's difficult to see the enemies. I sure thought the reviews would have been a lot lower than what they are. One last note, anyone with epilepsy should not play this game because of the lights.
1471	0	This is more of an expansion pack than it is a new game. I have had countless problems with bugs that are yet to be addressed. I feel like I am playing battlefield 3 with a bit of extra textures and one more faction. Buy only if you have not played battlefield 3, otherwise it is not worth the 60 USD.
1472	0	I didn't much care for this a it's so hard and no more moves over and over crops up, that it's so hard to beat because they're just isn't enough pieces to go forward a lot of time.<br />A game should be challenging, but on my part....NOT the lack of game pieces and lose over and over gain with bad algorithms or code. I didn't like it so much.
1473	0	The story is terrible, but the game play is fantastic. You'll have a blast grappling a plane as it takes off, highjacking it mid-air and soaring around island looking for the perfect place to jump out and opening up a parachute. The gunplay is fairly meh, driving is kinda sloppy, and the island is mostly tress, but you can spend lots of your time finding out how to have fun. I guarantee it everyone has tried landing a plane on the party blimp at some point.
1474	0	I really forgot how old and outdated the graphics are in this game, but i loved playing it as a kid, so i went for it.  It is fun, but the visuals are a bit clunky.
1475	-1	I finally got around to booting this up on my Win7 x64 machine and was immediately disappointed.  I use a Razer Megalodon 7.1 surround headset and I was getting static from the back right and center right sources.  Not the whole time, but during cut scenes and some of the game play.  It was incredibly annoying.  I quit out and booted up Diablo 3 - no sound problems there, so it's not the hardware, it's the software.<br /><br />In game it had a neat collection mechanic and combat was fun, but moving through the world was choppy.  I don't know how else to describe it, I would be moving, then my character would halt for a second, then keep moving.  I don't believe  it's my keyboard (Logitech G510) because I experience no such issues in other FPS I play.  This odd movement in the game without an explanation in-game for why it was like that was a major turn-off.<br /><br />Finally, this game is supposed to have awesome co-op.  The game alerted me at one point that there was another player available to join which I tried to do, but was told there was an issue connecting.  I was disappointed and stopped playing.<br /><br />So - if I start at 3 stars, it loses all three for technical issues but gains 2 for fun combat and a semi-immersive collection mechanic that made me feel I was really on a post-apocalyptic resort island.<br /><br />Also - final note, they swore a lot.  Gratuitous language is the mark of an uneducated, barely-literate mind and it doesn't add anything to the experience.  Swearing is an important part of language, but doing it all the time makes the act of swearing less meaningful.
1476	-1	The code I received was invalid, EA Origin support was useless as always.
1477	0	I like the puzzles.  The game play is ok.  The drawback is the game won't save when you exit the software.  The game attempts to save when you leave a puzzle but all puzzle pieces are gone when you reopen the puzzle in progress.
1478	0	Solid,  beautiful game but very short campaign and if you're not into multi-player your $60 doesn't stretch far. That's normal for this series though so no point in complaining...
1479	1	Watching the Olympic biathlon is one of my favorite events in the winter Olympics. I don't know how close this is to the real thing, but it's a fun game. It takes some time to get the skiing part down, and it can be frustrating at times, but it's worth it. I really enjoyed this game.
1480	-1	Natalie Brooks: Secrets of Treasure house is a casual game that consists of hidden object and logic puzzles.  It has a few good points, but unfortunately, it contains mostly bad qualities.<br /><br />Story - It's a bit confusing at first, but you eventually realize that you have inherited your grandma's house from her after she died, but the city wants to bulldoze the house and build a highway there.  In order to stop them, you get a petition for the most respected people in town to sign, saying they don't want the bulldoze to happen.  Meanwhile, you come to find out that there is supposedly a treasure hidden in the house that someone else in the town is trying to find.  Unfortunately, the game seemed more about getting the petition signed rather than solving any kind of mystery, and it was a little boring, to be honest.<br /><br />Gameplay - The gameplay will usually consist of a scene in which you have to find items (by randomly rolling your cursor over them and having them light up) in order to interact with other items.  For instance, you may need to find a key hidden in an office so that you can open a drawer and read a paper.  However if you can't figure out what to do next, you can use one of your hints, which you collect throughout the game.  Occasionally, you will come across a logic puzzle that you need to solve.  You are able to skip these, but you probably won't need to, for they are very easy.  The other part of the game would be search and find scenes which give you more hints.  These basically scatter a bunch of items (everything from telephones and TVs to binoculars and gloves) in a scene, and you are given a list of items to find in a time limit.  Depending on how many you find and how quickly you find them, you are given hints.  The gameplay really was fun enough, but most of the time it was too simplistic!  It was really easy to find the items, and the puzzles were usually easy too.<br /><br />Graphics - The graphics were actually pretty good in the game.  The cutscenes were much like comic book cartoons, and the scenes that you would play in the game were much like 3D cartoons.  They were bright and colorful, and they were really well done as a whole.<br /><br />Sound - First of all, there is no voice acting at all in this game; it relies only on text.  Second, the music in this game was very slow, repetitious, soft, and boring.  At first, it was OK, but it got old very quickly, and I was seriously hating it near the end of the game.<br /><br />Fun Factor - The game is fun, but it is also extremely easy.  There is really no challenge whatsoever.  So, it would be great for people who want a game that they won't have to think hard on AT ALL, b/c it doesn't require much thought.  It would probably also be good for kids to play, too, as it is really easy, but do be forewarned that it has one curse word in it.<br /><br />Length - This was the biggest downfall of the game.  The game was insanely short, and the ending was so quickly done, that I was literally shocked that the game was over.  It had only lasted about 2 hours, and the real mystery in the story, it appeared, had only just started.  It was really much TOO short of a game.<br /><br />Overall pros are that the game is fun to play and the graphics are good.  However the cons are that the story wasn't mysterious or very good at all, the music was boring and got old, the game was too easy and short, and there was something wrong with the cursor in this game.  It would constantly flicker which was really annoying.  So, if you want a fun, extremely easy, extremely short game, this is for you.  But if you want some sort of a challenge or length to your game, look elsewhere.
1481	1	Pros:<br />-Excellent game mechanics. Many possible ways to play the game. This is a worthy Deus Ex game.<br />-Adam Jensen is an awesome protagonist!<br />-Good storyline and locations. I always digg augmentation and sci-fi stuff<br />-Graphics looks great, has it's own style to define itself<br />-Steam activated<br /><br />Cons:<br />-DLC. I just don't like DLC in general.<br />-I never asked for this >.>
1482	1	provide many hours of entertaining .<br />the music/sound is very good.<br />when can't get to the casino enjoy a game at home free.<br /><br />would recommend.
1483	-1	Ive been a fan of FF since I was a kid and have bought just about every game since but this 1 for the PC isn't worth it. Sure the game is good but you will spend hours just setting up a play online id and a square enix id and then transfer it and then you have to deal with a non existent support staff because the play online is garbage and won't let you sign in.The headache just isn't worth it when Tera is now free to play and is the same exact type of game with great graphics and they actualy have 24 hour chat open for any kind of problems. So if you like headaches and aggrivation then this game is for you. If you like online mmo go for Tera.
1484	-1	Purchased it thinking I could use the online capabilities, instead got the run around about how the version I have is not compatible towards online play. Game sucks solo.
1485	1	Mount and Blade warband is the only medieval sandbox game I have ever encountered.  The graphics are not perfect, but they are compromised to allow large scale first-person battles without slowing game speed.  You begin your life as a player in Calradia, a land comprised of six factions with alternately war with each other.  When creating a character, you select the characters background ie. parents, previous occupations.  These choices will affect your characters starting abilities and supplies.  Unlike many other sandbox games, you are not the hero the world has been waiting for.  Every decision you make will positively or negatively affect you life in Calradia.  You have the ability to hire men to your party and as they gain experience you can upgrade them to better troops.  Also in the game are companions.  These are bots like the recruits you hire except like you they cannot die, gain skill levels and can wield any weapons you give them.  As your rise in militant and political power you can fight as a lord for any of the six warring factions.  Eventually with enough power and following you can found your own empire and conquer all of Calradia.<br />Multipalyer:<br />Since the sandbox game is single player only, Mount and Blade Warband also includes a multiplayer feature.  In multiplayer, everyone has the same skill level and strength.  Matches range from five to thirty minutes in which the objectives range from, team capture the flag to deathmatch where everyone is an enemy and you have only yourself to rely upon.<br />Overall Mount and Blade warband is an addictive gaming experience for those who enjoy realistic medieval combat.
1486	-1	I should have trusted you all, but I didn't. I figured people would never be happy after waiting so long for a new Sim City or that maybe it was just too different for people to like. What I found was a buggy, laggy, and clunky game with a terrible UI, over rated graphics, and bugs galore. I waited a long time until after this game was released for them to fix servers, patch the software, etc and its the same ole same ole. I remember back in the days of Maxis when everything they released was gold, it now seems that with a big company like EA behind Sim City, they are just using the name and rebranding it to some Sim City want a be. To say I am disappointed wouldn't even sum it up. I wish I could get my money back because honestly, Ill never play this game again. Its garbage.
1487	-1	What a disappointment!  Create a sim and build modes, which were supposed to be easier, were both clumsy and difficult to navigate.  Going anywhere in the small town is a process and while interactions are expanded, they are not unique.  The camera doesnt follow you selected sim.  Graphics are pretty good, but without the ability to customize, does that really matter?  I'm sticking with the sims 3.  Maybe improvements will be made as the expansion packs roll out.
1488	1	Decent
1489	-1	I cannot recommend this game for the Mac.  I met and in some cases exceeded the system requirements needed to play this game and was confronted with atrocious mouse lag and a frame rate of less than 5 frames per second, rendering gameplay impossible.  Internet research shows that the general opinion is that the Mac port is extremely sub-standard.  May be playable if you have much higher specs on your Mac than is recommended.  A waste of $20.  Bought it for $20 for the Xbox and borrowed a friend's Xbox360 to play it on and it's a great aggressive stealth action game.  Do your research and make sure your Mac can perform this game properly before purchasing.
1490	-1	I bought a download code for this game. It was my first time buying a download code for ANY game, and it didn't exactly come with installation instructions. I couldn't get the code to work on the Sims 3 website. I tried and tried and it never would activate my purchase. I thought &#34;Maybe i have to register it first.&#34; so i did, and once i did that i can no longer use my download code, it's invalidated.<br /><br />I did NOT get to download the game, and i went to Sims 3 customer service, but he told me that since i bought it here on Amazon, nothing could be done for me on their end.<br /><br />I asked Amazon customer service if i could get a new code. They said &#34;Maybe, i am not sure, let me get back to you.&#34;<br /><br />Weeks later, Amazon has ignored me, i do NOT have a Sims 3 game on my computer, and i don't think i will ever purchase another Sims game, nor will i ever buy a download code for anything from Amazon, ever again. Period. The End.
1491	1	"first review:<br />I keep getting \\""CRC error: the [file location...] doesn't match the file in the setup's .cab file\\"" on installation. I keep hitting retry and it goes through, but then when I have to patch the game it freezes. I guess I'm going to uninstall and re-download. Kind of wish Amazon would just send us all physical copies to make up for this pretty egregious error.<br /><br />edit:<br />so i uninstalled everything, re-downloaded the game, then did a fresh install. everything worked fine, and the game is amazing, truly amazing. watch out that your download doesn't get interrupted too many times, and don't mess with any of the file locations. also make sure that the la noire installer installs the rockstar social app. happy investigating!"
1492	1	Excellent method to purchuse ps games,
1493	-1	"Hi there...<br /><br />I was stupid enough to preorder this embarrassing sorry effort of a game and now I struggle to get my money back.<br /><br />This game is a beta, you have to pay for! Some even say it is only an Alpha.<br /><br />On the pro side there are some pretty good ideas. It is quite complex and there is a lot to do.<br /><br />The graphics aren't that good, but that is not the main issue. I could live with the graphics.<br /><br />The game is unplayable because of:<br /><br />- CTDs all the time<br />- controls are lousy at least (sometimes your ships won't obey your commands or get stuck or you can't click on them)<br />- you can't cancel combat and you are stuck in the middle of it<br />- ships get stuck in warp<br />- not enough info/tooltips<br />- no end turn report (\\""Construction ready\\"" - um where? what is ready?)<br />- no animated movement of your ships in the stratetic view (ships just \\""beam\\"" to their destination)<br />- camera movement is terrible!<br />- etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and burn your money instead...that would be more fun, than playing this game..seriously! Have a look in the forums or at amazon.de...devastating reviews! :(<br /><br />sorry for my bad english, but I really wanted to warn all english speaking customer!"
1494	-1	You could just read all the other reviews and realize what's going on. Another typical Steam failure. I have sent Amazon a message recommending that they no longer use Steam's services.<br /><br />The game can't be installed from Steam.<br /><br />Don't buy it from a site that will direct you to install from Steam. Buy it somewhere else, and make sure Steam isn't involved.
1495	0	Early reviews of the digital version were bad, but since that release, the game's come a long way. Kalypso's released several patches and gameplay enhancements which speed up the play of the game, and make it more fun overall.<br /><br />Traditionally, the Port Royale series was all about trading and being a merchant in a sort of open-world environment. With Port Royale 3, they've added an adventurer campaign so if you want to go around shooting pirates and saving princesses, you can do that, or go with the merchant campaign if you more like sailing around, making money and building little shipping empires. If you want a mix, you can always play in sandbox.<br /><br />There's plenty to do in Port Royale 3, that's for sure!
1496	-1	Can't get in to it due to the fact that you have to use the arrow keys to move around.  Very disappointed!!!
1497	1	I have been playing the C&C games since the original Command & Conquer when Westwood studios was still running the show and not mucking up the games with pesky DRM. Great games, EA of course slacked on the patching department so if you don't mind doing some manual patching and getting some third party fixes these games will bring you back to the golden age of RTS.<br /><br />My only issue is that EA is now running the show and it uses Origin.
1498	0	My son tried it and found that it was a co-op game & if you don't like those types of games like my son doesn't then this game is not 4 you.
1499	-1	I ordered this download for my granddaughter for Easter.  I was never able to complete the download and I kept getting a security risk message.  I was lucky that Amazon refunded my money even though it has a no refund policy after I gave them a very detailed list of the problem.  Thank you Amazon!
1500	0	This was a lot of fun, and well worth $3.49. Graphics are good and items are easily found. I only used the hint maybe three times. I didn't have problems at the end like others; I had problems releasing items in the minigame with cutting vegtables (using a laptop.) Had to exit the whole game twice. For a better rating, I would wish for a short cut once you back tracked to attain items. Going to and from places just felt like a waste of time. Murder Island: Tatalus was better because it has a map you can jump to places. This Columbus story is just ok. I missed the first part of the story, so after completeing I started the game again. Discovered that the game has you search for some different items- bonus!
1501	1	I honestly much rather use these on the PSN than my own credit/debit card. These work great and I would suggest them to everyone.
1502	1	This is a fantastic game<br /><br />Cartoon i thought bummer but after playing it for a bit dam good game go buy it
1503	-1	Never could get it to let me log in. Good thing it was cheap. I'll be more careful in the future.
1504	-1	I found that the control keys did not respond as they should.  Sometimes when you hit the key nothing happened and other times   they responded so slow that it was inpossible to play. I am   just sorry that I can not get my money back and wished that I   had not bought the download!
1505	0	Pros: More guns, more gun customization<br />Beautiful graphics<br />Solid frame rate<br />Engrossing story<br />Pretty decent combat system<br />Very good soundtrack<br /><br />Cons: Planet scanning system is a hassle<br />Walking around the Citadel and Normandy is a hassle<br />Cover system is better but still clunky<br /><br />Overall, Mass Effect 3 is a very solid game and I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed ME2 or ME1. highly recommend if you have a save data from previous games as it adds thousands of variables and gives closure to a wonderful series.<br /><br />Edit: My review previously was prior before finishing this game. All the other reviews are right, this game has the worst ending possible. It is a big shame as the series was engrossing. Bioware did, however, entertain the idea on an alternate ending... So hopefully they make FREE dlc to give a proper wrap up to this series
1506	0	A couple decades ago, Sega inflicted a wonderful, horrible fever dream on the world. You were a blue cartoon hedgehog in sneakers, and you had to run through intensely stylized landscapes fighting robots and collecting shiny rings. Although in modern times the franchise would devolve into Moe princesses and evil twins with oversized handguns, the classic Genesis Sonic games were beautiful Edens of psychedelic imagery, funky music, and razor-sharp gameplay. Opinion is divided on which of the 16-bit Sonic games is best, but there is no denying that Sonic 3 and Knuckles (you had to lock a little half cartridge into your console then stick the regular Sonic 3 cart on THAT) was the BIGGEST Classic Sonic game. With 3 playable characters, tons of secrets to hunt, and a bunch of branching, organic levels to explore, this game afforded kids of the 90s with hours of fun.<br /><br />By all rights, then, I should love this game. It's reasonably pitch-perfect- the colors, the music, everything is EXACTLY as you remember it. This is because the game is more or less running from a dump of the original ROM, inside a virtual machine developed by Sega. And therein lies the problem. You see, for the longest time there were only two ways to play this game- on a Sega Genesis, if you still had one, or in an Emulator- a fan-created VM capable of running fan-dumped copies of the game ROM. Emulation USED to be arguably legal* under Fair Use, but the Digital Millennium Copyright Act says that any action that circumvents software copy protection is illegal- that means Genesis emulation is now not cool, period. UNLESS you ARE Sega, and you make your own emulator, which is how this game and all the downloadable Genesis games work. So what you are playing is in fact an official, licensed Sega Emulator. Will wonders never cease?<br /><br />And it's horrible.<br /><br />The game lags, both in places it did on console and in places it didn't. And worse than that, controller input is slightly delayed. I'm playing with a wired gamepad so the experience should be just like the Genesis, but there is a noticeable delay between button presses and in-game action, more so if lag is already occurring. Why is this a big deal? Because the biggest innovation of the sonic games of old was incredibly precise, tight platforming. The kind of minute tweaks to jumps and momentum that were essential on the Genesis are now quite tricky to pull off. Nowhere is this more hair-pulling than in special stages, where tight turns and split-second timing are essential to success. In proper Sonic gameplay you should feel like a ninja, effortlessly bouncing around at speed. Here, every precision movement demands a cold-sweat focus and nerves of steel. Essentially, then, Sega is punishing its customers for obeying the law by hitting them with a more frustrating game experience. It's disappointing to see such a fantastic game given such a shoddy legitimate release. And what makes it worse is the OUTSTANDING true port that Sonic CD received in 2011. After playing that flawless remake, the problems with Sega's emulator become sadly clear.<br /><br />PROS<br />-This game sounds and looks as outstanding as it did when you were a kid.<br />-Even with dodgy controls Sonic 3 and Knuckles is easily one of the top 5 most fun 16-bit games ever made.<br />-Sega's emulator supports manual and quick state saves AND the save system used by the game ROM. And at no point does the game glitch, apart from lag.<br />-Great price, this game would be worth 10 bucks, let alone 5.<br /><br />CONS<br />-Lag, beyond what you would expect from strict Genesis emulation.<br />-Controller delay hurts what should be a tremendously responsive gameplay experience.<br />-Unjustifiably high system requirements given the age of the console being faked.<br /><br />* I want to stress that this review is not an endorsement of unlicensed Genesis emulation. Removing or bypassing the copy protection on any copyrighted or trademarked work of software using means not approved by the creator is currently illegal in the United States, and if you read up on Sega v. Accolade you will see that the Genesis did in fact incorporate copy protection.
1507	1	The Xbox LIVE  card is an excellent way for my son to continue or add on to his games.  I was happy to be able to purchase the card and have it immediately applicable; no driving, no lost card, just great service.
1508	1	as expected.
1509	0	Yeah, everyone here is just on the EA hate wagon. They don't own the game. Just like I do not own the game and I am writing this right now. They think they know everything about the game, and they don't even have the game.
1510	0	It has a fun game play and the story is ok, but as an MMO it's dead. I ran into maybe 3 people while playing.
1511	0	Battlefield 3 is fantastic. Origin? It SUCKS. If you can put up with Origin, get Battlefield 3. Not all human beings have the capacity for such a Steam-inferior design.
1512	1	Great app
1513	1	gift
1514	-1	The graphics suck compared to the pictures...they make it look so good. Its not! Definately not worth 20 bucks or 10 or 5 bad game DONT BUY AND MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID!
1515	0	Just levels of objects.  No story.
1516	1	you definately need it to make 6 playable....
1517	0	The major downfall to this round of SIMs is that the more expansion packs I add, the longer it takes to get into the game to actually play.  There is a lot of overhead with the game for the shear quantity of time that you spend playing it.  I think that I'm out of the micromanaging games.
1518	-1	Likes to randomly freeze, and not just the game but the entire computer so that task manager can't even be opened to kill the program. The game can take a long time to complete so you can lose an hour or more of playtime and then have to sit through rebooting the computer. I like the game itself but would recommend getting it on disc instead.
1519	-1	I know it was written in the instruction, but the game did not  work on my new Lenovo Yoga even with win7 compatibility mode. I was need to by a mac version and play it on my mac and even there the game did not worked well. Rendering issues - crashes ....
1520	1	If you don't have time to go to a store to buy a PSN card. This option works just as well. I have never had a problem with any of my multiple purchases. It gives you a code and then you just input it into you PS3 like any PSN card. Extremely convenient when new content comes out and you don't have a chance to get to the store.
1521	0	I've played hidden pictures in books and on my laptop for years. Each computer applicaiton is well documented with instructions and clues.  Unfortunately, if you get stuck on Pure Hidden there are no clues to help you find your last missing object so you cannot go forward to the next segment.  It's frustrating and not fun.  Maybe it's too competitive and advanced for the recreational user like me.
1522	-1	i was supposed to receive a code for the game of the year edition and i got one for regular...
1523	0	The Good: Charming visuals and story, stacking dolls is unique, multiple solutions to puzzles is fine to figure out, hi-jinks and challenges for completists<br /><br />The Bad: No map, no reward for doing side missions, can be beaten in a short few hours, figuring out the puzzles can be a real pain<br /><br />Double Fine Productions is known for very original and unique games (Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest) but has a hard time creating them, it seems. Stacking is about a small matryoshka doll named Charlie Blackmore who goes on a quest to stop child labor, and stop the evil Baron from enslaving children for his selfish needs. In the process he is saving his family members who are trapped. The game is very charming visually and appeals to all audiences.<br /><br />The main gameplay in Stacking consists of you stacking inside dolls that are bigger than you and solving puzzles. There are areas that have someone blocking something, or something needs to be triggered, and you have to find the right doll to do this. You get three clues to help you along the which is a lifesaver, because otherwise, it would be very difficult to know what to do. There are so many dolls that stacking each one would take forever. One puzzle involved finding a way into a cell that is holding a doll. The man is a doctor, so you have to find ways to make him feel ill. Stack into a doll blowing air and then a fire chief. Spray him with water then unstack and blow air on him to make him sick. This is just one of multiple solutions. Each area has several ways to solve puzzles, and finding them all will unlock stuff in your hub, but it's nothing useful.<br /><br />You can also complete hi-jink challenges which is where you use dolls abilities a certain amount of times. You can also complete challenges which are like side missions where you are helping dolls out. I found these pretty boring and is really for only people who just want to mess around. There is really no reward for completing the game 100%, but if you love the stacking gameplay a lot go for it. If you get lost around the game there is a guide line, thankfully, because like I mentioned above you will get lost. There isn't a map either, so identifying dolls and take forever and get boring. This is a big problem with challenges because there is no way to know who you stacked or who you should stack. This is only half the problem because then you need to know what to do with their ability.<br /><br />The story is charming and so is the visuals. Cut scenes are played out like old silent films, and the game has a satisfying ending (remember Double Fine doesn't do sequels). The controls work just fine, and mechanics are simple, but the execution has problems from what I explained. The game itself can be beaten in just a few hours if you only find one solution for each area and skip everything else. Only completists will want to bother doing this. For the low price you get a very unique game, but if you can't look pasts these problems then you won't enjoy it.g the game 100%, but if you love the stacking gameplay a lot go for it.

1526	-1	Save your money, and hope that future versions might resolve all the open issues. I read a lot of bad press on it, but really wanted it and would like to return it now. Had issues installing it on an older computer, but it should have worked on it, shows a blank screen. Read comments on steam ad you will see others with the same experience. Installed it on a newer computer only to find the use of a steering wheel and pedals that work fine on other racing programs do not work. Again, see others comments on steam. What a shame.
1527	0	The Death Rides DLC doesn't seem to add very much content particularly given its cost.  Unlike the Death Rides DLC, the side quests are integrated into the main story, which I prefer to having to choose a campaign.  Most rewards are only money and experience, although I usually prefer my custom possessed weapons anyway so I don't really need more 'special items'.  Admittedly I haven't finished the Bloodless quest yet, but you can still get to the areas to find the Bloodless without the DLC, so I assume you only get more Exp and money.
1528	0	I'm not going to write the (what seems like) mandatory complaint about Origin or Battlelog. No one likes them. Period. It just sucks up ram, and whatever, let's focus on the actual game here. The multiplayer is quite fun and the visuals (as well as the glorious sounds) from the Frostbite 2 engine are great! However, the level design for the most part fall short. A lot of the favorite maps are the worst ones (my opinion of course, you may like them more). Seine Crossing, Operation Metro, Gran Bazaar, these were all maps with great potential but fell short by making it basically a trench warfare style with A LOT of camping. Especially in Seine Crossing. They just feel entirely too small and cramped up for 64 players. Not the Battlefield that DICE has given us with 1942, 2, nor 2142. Overall, it felt like they kind of put too much focus on the console versions and the PC version suffered for it (and no, I'm not a PC elitist, this is my first year playing on the PC since 1942 was released. I was only able to play the other releases at friends houses). Can be fun for short bursts. Good game, but not at $60. Hopefully, they'll return to their roots in 4.
1529	-1	Thanks for nothing, you guys said the game would be playable after 12am PST. but its not instead i have to wait until steam itself puts the game up and that's not until 12pm later today..
1530	-1	its okay, but people ONLY use expansion maps / servers online , so if you plan on playing online plan on paying 50$ more for premium after this purchase....the game is awesome!! just be aware that in order to play online you will need to buy premium, because literally no one plays on bf4 maps, and every cool game mode / map are expansions.....<br /><br />so be aware.... 2 stars is because it seems for 20$ or so you can play an awesome game, but it is really a hoax, because to actually play it will cost you 70$, but besides that.... great game A+ , just wish there were more servers online
1531	1	I love this game!! I bought it just to see how was it and im really pleased! I recommended for ff fans!
1532	0	This game is pretty addicted. Steeped in the tradition left by the original Centipede, Chicken Invaders features a spaceship battling hoards of evil chickens in its journey through space. Its a fun take on an old arcade classic
1533	-1	did not finish download have to get stream to finish this should have known before that is why I think you should be able to download then pay for what you get.  whish they would say when these co. require extra downloads
1534	1	All perfect but i just have an issue..<br />I cant use the promotional code for Harley quinn dlc, san that i already used.. What i can do for resolve this?
1535	0	This is the gratuitous clothing line stuff pack. I expected alot more out of this one but even though the clothes are cute, I'd wait until it's marked down alot to buy it.
1536	-1	"The game is beautiful.  But it's obviously designed for Xbox 360-style players, not PC gamers.  It feels very much like a console game.  Movement is via WASD keys, with camera angle controlled by the mouse. Characters lurch backward and forward, left and right like Mario Brothers or something.  Seems silly for a 2012 game, when I compare with other games with smooth character movement.<br /><br />I could live with that, maybe, except for the crashes and the launcher hangs.  Of 5 or 6 sessions playing, the game crashed about 5 times with an \\""8000:0000\\"" error complaining about network problems.  Yet, other network games work just fine from my system.<br /><br />The worst was when I went to stop billing on the account.  Selecting the option to edit automatic renewal on the account offers up a dialog box with 'Accept' and 'Cancel' options.<br /><br />Neither selection changed the automatic billing.  I filed a ticket with support to tell them to cancel my account.  Maybe this game will be better in 2 or 3 years."
1537	0	Scribblenauts Unlimited is a fun game, especially if it's your first time play a game in the series (the previous few were NDS exclusives). If you are not new to Scribblenauts then it is more of the same. There are a whole lot more levels and a very good editor for editing entries in your notebook and creating new ones, but I find myself just using the same items over and over again. That all being said it is a fun game to play when you're bored.
1538	0	IM not really into RPG's but I figured i'd try it. It is a huge came, I played it for several hours to give a good opinion... I think its good but i'd rather shoot people up in a 1st person game rather than a fantasy mmo game. I'll still keep playing it though good job witht he game your free to do whatever you want.
1539	0	Not good as the the first one
1540	1	Game Code works. BF4 is different Story. Item as described. 10/10
1541	0	I don't know if it's a Mac issue but I can't play this game for more than hour without some error popping up and then crashing. SAVE EVERY FIVE MINUTES BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'LL CRASH ON YOU. It's really frustrating but like I said, I keep on playing it because well, it's fun.
1542	1	Dead Island is tailor-made for those of us who like to do their killing up-close and personal – and with copious amounts of blood and gore.  The only thing better than slicing some Thug’s arms off is to break them instead so you can watch him sling the useless things around before you kill him.  I’ve played a lot of shooters in my time, but no FPS shooter compares to the gloriously gory mayhem that is Dead Island.  They call it “visualized gore” but I just call it awesome.  You leave a gory trail of limbs and torsos behind you as you progress through this game.<br /><br />The game’s visuals are well-nigh stunning.  The island of Banoi is a tropical paradise and looks every bit of it.  Unfortunately, some wanker had to go and start a zombie epidemic to ruin everyone’s fun.  You have the option of playing as one of four different characters – although my man Sam B. is just too cool for me to play as anyone else.  Sam came to Banoi to perform at one of the resorts (basically living off of his one hit song, Who Do You Voodoo? (which is awesome, by the way – I’d totally buy it).  He’s also your muscle melee kind of guy who fights the baddies eye to eye.  If you want to engage in more gunplay or throwing knives and other sissy stuff like that, choose another character.  All of the available characters have one thing in common – for whatever reason, they are immune to the virus.  Each of them can still die easily enough, but none of them are going to turn into flesh-eating monsters.  The downside to this whole immunity thing is that you (and your partners if you play co-op) pretty much have to do all of the dirty work to help others besides yourselves survive (although Sam B. pretty much cares only about himself).  All four characters basically play as a team, which can be a little disconcerting when you play a solo campaign.  You’re on your own out there with the zombies, but some cut scenes feature all four of the characters.<br /><br />You start out with little more than a wooden oar and your fists, but your tools of the zombie-killing trade increase as you go along (as does the strength of the zombies).  By killing zombies and completing missions for survivors, you gain experience (and a selection of skills that come with it), better weapons, and cash – and you’ll need plenty of cash to keep your weapons in good shape and to upgrade their effectiveness.  Best of all, there are a number of weapon modification plans available that help you to take your zombie slaying to whole new levels.  It’s great fun to set a zombie on fire and watch him burn, or to electrocute him, or to bash his head in with one swing – although a plain and simple decapitation gives me more satisfaction than anything else.  Oftentimes, the freshly severed head will sort of hover in the air for a second while the rest of the body tumbles to the ground.  And then there’s rage mode, which makes you and your fists alone the most powerful killing instrument on Banoi.<br /><br />The AI could be improved a little bit, but Dead Island still represents quite a challenge.  Alongside your run-of-the-mill zombies you’ll face powerful Thugs, Suiciders who can kill you in a second if you get too close to them for too long, Bloaters who spew deadly acid all over the place, and Rams who can run you over and kill you in a heartbeat.  You need different strategies to kill different enemies – but they all can become pretty predictable after you’ve faced them a few times.<br /><br />There’s really only one thing I don’t like about Dead Island.  All of the NPC females are butt ugly – heck, some of them look better as zombies than they do in real life.  Seriously, what is up with that?  You’ve got bikini-clad women all over the island, and you don’t bother to make any of them the least bit attractive.  What, did the designers think seeing a cute chick or two would distract me from the whole zombie apocalypse thing?t out with little more than a wooden oar and your fists, but your tools of the zombie-killing trade increase as you go along (as does the strength of the zombies).

1543	-1	I have a new mac book. The download was easy, but when i went to play the game everything was updated but the city itself! Anyone have any ideas why this might be?!
1544	1	This little game is just like the other Crazy Chicken Games...fun, addicting and great to own and play.It is so fun for all ages...we love it..
1545	1	Bought this online gaming code to renew my x box live subscription and it worked out great.  You receive the code instantly and is better than allowing microsoft to have your credit card info to charge you as needed.
1546	-1	The single worst experience I have ever had purchasing from Amazon. First, upon purchasing this game from Amazon the web page kept trying to refresh (I didn’t even know the purchase had gone through until I logged out and back into Amazon). Second, after getting the game key I had a nightmarish time getting EA games system Origin to work. After 10hrs of waiting I finally was able to load and start playing the game. Much to my dismay the game play was terrible. I know the blame should not rest only on Amazon, but if Amazon is going to carry a product they should make sure the vendor they are supplying it for provides a good consumer experience. I have uninstalled the game. I will never play again. I just want to say thank you to EA for reaffirming my distain for PC games. I will never play SimCity again.
1547	0	Good solitaire but the Graphics are not the best. Look very old fashion and in some games the cards are almost blurry. Lots of solitaire, but the graphics ruin it for me.
1548	-1	Unfortunately, I think I will be saying goodbye to microsoft and xbox for my next system. Nickeled and dimed with the 360 along with the new all seeing eye of the kinnect on the yet released &#34;one&#34; has me feeling extremely irritated. I once considered myself a fan, but like most american companies nowadays, they feel like the customer owes them something even after they've bought their product.
1549	1	One year after smashing the Syndicate, Adam is kidnapped. his house is trashed, and his younger brother Skate rounds up Axel, Blaze, and muscle-bound wrestler Max to free him. It turns out that Mr. X is still alive and has regrouped his fractured criminal empire, taking control of the city once again with an even tighter grip.<br /><br />As one of the four heroes you must take to the raging streets and beat-up every man and his twin across ghettos, bridges, theme parks, ball parks, boats, beaches, jungles, factories, and finally Mr. X's headquarters for an epic showdown.<br /><br />The first Streets of Rage game was great, but the sequel takes all of its strengths (and none of its flaws) and cranks them all the way up, resulting in a vastly superior game. The graphics are more colorful, the sprites are larger, the combat is more complex, the level design is more innovative. Even Yuzo Koshiro's music, probably the best video game music of all time, is better second time around. The game may be 19 years old now, but there's no denying the excitement and funkiness of these tunes. They haven't aged a bit. You really ought to hunt down the [[ASIN:B00005ATJL Streets of Rage 2 (Original Soundtrack)]] and the numerous remixes.<br /><br />One of the best beat-em-ups, and video games, of all time. SOR2 is a definite classic that will never get old. This PlayStation-Network downloadable version comes with 12 Trophies, and a smoothing option for HDTVs.<br /><br />Graphics A<br />Sound A+<br />Gameplay A<br />Lasting Appeal A+
1550	1	Painless way to buy stuff on the PSN.
1551	-1	It was so similar to other games, that the seek and find part was not very challenging. The jewel boards were more challenging but there were not enough of them. The game felt very short, I feel like I way overpaid for it.
1552	1	thank you for the trip down memory lane. CnC3, kanes wrath, CnC4, and Tiberium sun + firestorm worked on windows 7.
1553	1	Was able to buy the game I needed right at home without having to stop by the game shops Great!!!
1554	0	Story wise, I havent finished the game but the story is rather entertaining to me. Control wise, its a nightmare. This game does not use the mouse at all. It is all keyboard commands. Was very disappointed in that. It only gets 3 stars due to the story, If I had to rate the gameplay itself it wouldn't go higher than a 2 at most. What fighting game in this day and age doesn't use a mouse on a computer?
1555	0	"1) Alcohol gets equipped as soon as you pick it up, so you need to re-equip your weapon or else end up chugging a bottle of whiskey in the face of a zombie attack. WTF?!<br /><br />2) Deodorant bombs equip as soon as you make them. Left-clicking \\""Back\\"" from the inventory view sends you back to gameplay but throws the bomb, typically in a confined area. In other words, it makes you die.<br /><br />3) Zombies are not slowed by water.<br /><br />I still find the game entertaining--I still haven't gotten used to the infected, I still jump when they start screaming--but it's details like the ones above that really detract from the overall product. It seems sloppy and/or rushed to market (even though I think it was many years in the making).<br /><br />I paid full price the day it was released. It's not worth that, but it's not bad for ~$15."
1556	1	This game is good. You have a non-linear story-line, so the story depends on your decisions. Drawbacks- Too few magical powers(compared to similar games like Fable trilogy), at some parts the story line does not depend on your decisions, you have to do certain things even if you dont want to. The story line is short compared to similar games. But, this game is worth the money(kind of).
1557	-1	I didn't realize this is an extension to Spore! It doesn't say in the description...now I have to buy Spore in addition to be able to play it.... It
1558	0	What'[s difficult about all 3 of these is the darkness of the screen & how small some items are - my eyes get very tired after playing for an hour or so. I have a laptop with a fairly large screen. The items are 'old English' not modern day so a football is a soccer ball for instance...have fun!
1559	-1	Boring
1560	0	This game is one of the best Sims games I have played in a while.<br /><br />I would give 4 1/2 stars just for the game play. But almost all the stars come off because of the crashes. The last time I played the game it crashed my computer.<br /><br />I am running it on Vista.
1561	1	Wow i spent playing this game for 7 hours and it was so good and i reallly want to buy this game again and again!!!!.
1562	1	If your a fan of the open world game-play genre, then you will love this game. This game has it all Girls guns, mature content.<br /><br />The highlights of the game:<br />STEERING CONTROL!!! Sadly the funnest part about open world games is that i can drive like a maniac and not have to make the perfect turn or handbrake the right amount. GTA 4 fails in comparison.<br /><br />DOWNFALLS<br />Some of the mission I.E. Trailblazing (deckers) is near impossible on hard/medium so it makes a city takeover ridiculously hard.<br /><br />-There is no auto aim so your forced to fight multiple enemies run and aim you gun on them.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />If you like Grand theft Auto Sand Andreas, youll love this game this is pretty must an upgraded version of that classic!!! This Game gets 4 stars simply because the downfalls are simply to much to overlook.
1563	-1	"I played through the original Prototype when it first came on on the PC and had a blast. I loved the mechanics, the open-world feeling, and the chaos of the character. So, when I found that they were offering Prototype 2 + the DLC for $10, how could I pass that up?<br /><br />I wish I had.<br /><br />Prototype 2 has a laundry list of PC problems, ranging from failure to start to performance decreases to the point of unplayability. For a listing of some of the bugs and their fixes, there is \\""[...]\\"", and a Reddit thread about all the problems at \\""[...]\\"". However, with my gaming rig that is able to play every other title very well (Dual Radeon 5700's, 8GB Ram, and Core i7 CPU), this game would not load for me. I got a Blue-Screen-of-Death every single time I tried to start the game fullscreen. I couldn't play the game windowed with a mouse+keyboard because the mouse would move outside of the game window and clicks outside of the game would cause the game to lose focus and minimize. I attempted to play with an Xbox 360 controller, but then, after around 15 minutes each time I loaded the game, the FPS would drop to around 15-20, making the game nearly unplayable.<br /><br />I have also found that the development company, Radical Entertaintment, went out of business shortly after releasing this game, and will not be supporting it any longer. This means that no patches will be released to fix any of the critical bugs that plague this game, meaning if you can't run it now, you probably never will be able to.<br /><br />I finally decided I'd had enough and would wait for the console price to go down.<br /><br />TL/DR: Do NOT buy this terrible PC port of a game. You will regret it."
1564	0	"L.A. Noire is an apology by Rockstar Games for not putting out Grand Theft Auto 5 by now.  Instead of a thug shooting cops, you are a cop shooting thugs.  The graphics are gorgeous on my Radeon 6850 and the idea is just right.  This game badly needs a Save button and something more fun in terms of gameplay.  I can't tell you how many times I had to reload the game after hearing some thug shout \\""jew-hating ****\\"" in the interrogation room because I picked the wrong piece of evidence to interrogate with.    To capture a runaway, I had to aim my gun at him for a few seconds to make him stop running.  Shooting him in the leg would've made the game more fun, but after I tried it I got a \\""Game Over\\"" for being too evil.     This game is not addictive and I'm going to put this away for a rainier day.  I'd rather spend my time shooting cops with bazookas in Grand Theft Auto.  At least they were polite about it."

1566	-1	"I was finally able to play SimCity after half a dozen Origin reinstalls, five hours on hold with EA tech support, a hundred refreshes of my games library, and an Origin crash. Yay!<br /><br />...only to be greeted by the least fun game I've perhaps ever played. It starts with a juttering, poorly-encoded several minute long video advertising...the game you are about to play? Bewilderingly guided to connect to servers in Oceana (the North American servers were full and I'd have to sit on my thumbs for another twenty minutes), I was presented with blank worlds that literally could not be interacted with in any way (apparently this happens in the tutorial level when the servers conk out). I stared, literally helpless, as citizens despaired. \\""Perhaps we should just let it do its thing for a few hours,\\"" suggested Jon Hull.<br /><br />After another couple tries I was able to connect to a server that looked like it would let me start a game. I pick a name for a region, select a plot, and...\\""Cannot create a city here, please try again later\\"" comes the mysterious error. Over and over again. I try another server. Same deal. \\""Click here for more info\\"" suggests a popup, which links to a 404 page on EA's website.<br /><br />Eastern Europe finally manages to connect me to a game I can start; it's almost half an hour in and I haven't started playing. My roommates are staring over my shoulder in shock and awe. \\""This is up there with Dwarf Fortress,\\"" suggests Nato Saichek. The tutorial seems to be working, albeit with obviously not-filled-out template text. It walks me through how to handle sewage systems, which is by building pumps that excrete the raw sewage directly onto the ground (\\""this maycause ground pollution\\"" warns the game, while forcing me to drop the unit in place). I'm advised that if I run out of coal at any point I ought to make a city elsewhere instead. Ah, that's an environmental message we can all get behind. At the conclusion of the tutorial, SimCity crashes.<br /><br />Bedtime. Weren't games supposed to be fun? This has truly been an ordeal without joy.<br />Bedtime. Weren't games supposed to be fun?

1567	1	I really like this DLC for BL2. I have played this game for over 400 hours on record and this DLC added another 5 to that. It is short, but I love fighting the end boss over and over.
1568	1	nice challenging game. my first youda game and it was a great one.  much like the farm frenzy games but does a twist near the end that is more challenging.
1569	1	Came as expected
1570	1	Literally took me two days to download and install but it was well worth the wait. Great game overall!!
1571	1	It is a very simple match 3 game. I like the beautiful sea graphic and nice music. Like the ability to add fish you choice after each rounds. Perfect for someone who is looking for a simply and relaxing game.
1572	-1	the game downloaded but did not play on my pc after I installed it,would not work

1574	-1	OMG I have been downloading the sims for 12  hours and when it got done it told me I had to do it again. Where is my game? Can someone HELP!
1575	-1	I had to download a second one because the first code did not come through, so I wasted some money.
1576	0	Not as good as other Heroes games. Not enough choices to set up own games. Not enough maps . It is just ok nothing great but not to bad.
1577	-1	I had it originally purchased through another game site, well they wouldnt let me redownload it.  I paid you for it, not worth the money.  I prefer the free phone version, it actually gives you goals to accomplish, not like this just build a zoo one that the PC version is.<br /><br />Double paid for a bogus game :(.
1578	-1	i wanted a simple download of a game, took me to a site where i was supposed to set up a new account, could not figure out how to access the game, i better get my $ back
1579	1	Pros: this is dig dug<br /><br />Cons: it asks for name in the begin instead of the end so<br />it gets tedious if you wanna record a bunch off peoples<br />scores
1580	1	The game my husband loves, finely he has his own! Great download time.
1581	1	It was a good item and i would recommend people to buy it if they like borderlands 2.It is also a good deal at a low price.
1582	1	it works for any purchases if you need a store card id get this one as you can buy alot of things with 10bucks
1583	-1	The account linking didn't work...Don't ever use this!
1584	0	It missing the depth and polish it had before. The new movement style is interesting to say the least. However I will be moving on soon.
1585	1	I had already owned the Xbox version of Dark Souls when I bought this one. Seeing as the DLC itself is $15, and this was on sale for $15, I just went ahead and bought this version, and I was greatly pleased. Although the built-in keyboard+mouse controls are, quite frankly, horrifying, the use of a controller easily fixes this problem (the game was meant to be played with a controller, anyways).<br /><br />All in all, if you're thinking about getting Dark Souls, this would be your best bet.
1586	-1	ms ... is.. really mean. they have a huge pay scale and frankly, i would not pay for xbl if i had not successfully pirated 360 gamesw for years. now i dont, but theyre getting thier money back. for sheezy.
1587	-1	I have not play a sub sim game since a game called 688I attack sub for sega genesis... After watching many videos on this game i decided to get this as a start off instead of going straight for Silent hunter 5. Needless to say i was very excited to download this game. And i even watched the video when it cam on. The i got into the menu and changed some things visually. So i was ready and clicked on the tutorial (sub school). This is not what a tutorial is about. If you wanted people to learn things on their own then this is definitely a tutorial for them. i would have rated this game higher had there been a tutorial but i have given up on learning how to play. good thing it was only 9.99.
1588	-1	This game was highly disappointing.  First, there is virtually no instruction on how to actually complete the scenarios.  I had to look up lots of help online to move forward after the 3rd Scenario.  Then certain parts of the game just stopped working for no reason.  I tried to fix them, but nothing worked.  Waitstaff just stopped taking orders on the 2nd floor of a restaurant or the kitchen staff wouldn't work, even though they had a clear path to everything in the kitchen.  Even when I put things back to original settings, it didn't work.  I stopped playing after 2 days of frustration.
1589	1	Great game.
1590	-1	I think I got this for cheaper than the cost of a value meal at McDonald's. Stay away, you could not find a more functionally broken game with half-assed, broken systems. The fighting is an attempt to meld Harry Potter with a third person shooter, and the result is boring, tedious, and obnoxious. The story in-game barely follows that of the book/movie, and does its best to inject everything it can to action it up. This is evident from the first mission where you fight Voldemort on a flying motorcycle.
1591	1	👍
1592	1	Live the ease of buying online codes!
1593	0	Mr. Toots is fun. But this game is not challenging even with the most diffcult level (especially the boss fight). The game is too short in length, and there is no real sense ending.
1594	-1	I have played variations of Slingo and thoroughly enjoyed the dames. This version is poorly designed. I would not encourage enyone to purchase Slingo Deluxe.
1595	1	Luxor Evolved is exciting and fast.  The sounds effects add to the excitement along with the concussion effects on the screen.  Very fun!
1596	1	Some Sonic games sort of failed, but this game outdoes any other. Fabulous story and gameplay, and a Chao mode which you can spend hours in. Great Game 10/10
1597	0	Trouble with the key on Steam: bought this item on Dec 22nd and registered the same day on Steam. Steam won't let me start the game because it didn't have the key. Many people were in the same situation, because trouble between Valve (Steam) and Rockstar (Max Payne).<br /><br />I could begin to play only after a couple of weeks, in the middle of January.<br /><br />I know it is not an Amazon fault, but it is worth mentioning.<br /><br />The game (Max Payne 3) itself is a bit old technically speaking (graphics over all) but for that price it is awesome. The other two games are masterpieces of their time, you should definetly play them if you haven't.
1598	1	Excellent game, kind of short playing time needed for completion, but story and playing style is awsome
1599	1	If you're a some-timer Sims player like myself, then the purchase is definitely worth it. I had finally gotten bored with my Late Night pack and decided that this would be a great addition. It was, and I enjoyed the added items to my game. I'm satisfied for now.
1600	1	Exactly what i wanted.
1601	-1	this garbage should never come to our homes,pure evil
1602	1	Excellent
1603	0	I thought this was a reboot!  It is!  Graphics made the game.  I've always wanted to try a tomb raider game.  Now I have.  It was just ok.  Won't play another.  Haven't finished this one, and I most likely won't  even on the easiest setting.  Just not my style of game play.
1604	0	Secret of the Scarlet Hand is the 6th entry in the long-running mystery game series. While it is one of the earlier games, and does feature an interesting location to explore and learn about, it suffers from far too much &#34;busy work&#34; that the player is forced to complete in order to progress the story, and rather than feeling necessary to the plot it just feels shoe-horned in.<br /><br />You play as Nancy, who is interning for the Beech Hill museum. A rare artifact is stolen, and Nancy has to investigate to get to the bottom of the theft. There are 4 characters you can interact with face-to-face, and several people that you can reach by phone. There are a few long-term characters that are introduced in this entry, including the notorious intern Sonny Joon, Prudence Rutherford, and the Hardy Boys, the latter two of whom are reachable by phone.<br /><br />The areas to explore are good, but as mentioned earlier, the puzzles feel very shoe-horned in and not essential to the plot, such as the assignment Nancy has to do as the intern where you listen to descriptions of the Mayan exhibits and match the recordings to the correct exhibit in the back room. I got so frustrated with this task when I was a kid that I gave up on the game for a long time before coming back and finally completing it with the help of the strategy guide. Also lacking are the face-to-face characters, who aren't particularly interesting or memorable.<br /><br />If you're very interested in learning about Mayan history, this is definitely a good game. And as always with Nancy Drew games, searching for clues and talking to the suspects is strong. However, this is not one of the better games. I wouldn't recommend it for a first-time player, although it's certainly worth a play for a devoted Nancy Drew fan.
1605	0	ANOTHER GRINDING GAME LIKE WOW<br />after you got 80 then its the end of it. you still need a lot of grinding to get good gear<br />very disappointed
1606	1	interesado en  este producto muy bueno para  aprovechar el máximo y sus beneficios que  ofrece  en juegos espero me llegue  pronto muchas  gracias
1607	-1	It has and never has worked. I have to create this log in name and all this and if you don't have internet then it doesn't work AT ALL.
1608	-1	The game is OK but don't buy it from Amazon.<br /><br />Bought the game from Amazon, installed it and was unpleasantly surprised that it is bundled with Steam - this is a piece of junk that hides the game on your PC and tries to force you to connect to their network whenever you play the game. They make money every time you start the game by showing you adds and selling add-ons, they don't give you an option to play the game unless connected to the internet, they slow significantly your computer, they listen to you via the PC microphone and you cannot stop them from doing so ...<br /><br />I know they claim the Steam junk is supposed to work offline - it is only supposed to do so - it has a bug and it doesn't - a bug engineered in the Steam business plan I guess.<br /><br />There is a checkbox not to store your Steam password and force yourself to connect to Steam every time you start the game. Even with the checkbox unchecked you have to connect to Steam before starting the game in a single player mode - I guess they don't make enough money when people play offline.<br /><br />There is a silver lining though - there is a way to bypass Steam. Unless you can figure how yourself, try connecting to their support staff and asking for help. Write a comment on your epxerience.
1609	0	I bought this and entered it into my PS3 right away with no issues.<br />I bought this in December - Christmas present for family.  My main goal of buying this was so that each month our family would get a free game or two.  I have 3 younger kids, so I thought this would be perfect, keep them happy with new games to play, and worth the money.<br />I must say, so far from January to March, out of the PS3 games, they've offered 12 free, but 9 have been &#34;M.&#34;  (Yes, I'm a parent who does go by the ratings as I don't want my kids playing mature games).<br />Granted, they still got 3 free games so far... it's not been as 'great' as I had hoped for.  On the PSN blog, I even commented and had a moderator respond that he'd bring that up (this was in February), but in March, same issue.  The free 'game of the month' was rated M, again.<br />Hence, if you are a parent that doesn't care what your kids play, or you are 17+, then you'll enjoy this because you do get a lot of free games.  Just beware that if you are getting this in hopes that your kids will get a lot of games, and you do go by the ratings, it may not be as beneficial as you think.
1610	0	READ THIS IF YOU INTEND TO BUY!!!!!<br /><br />If you are currently under an Xbox Live Gold Subscription under a credit/debit card it will not let you use this with it. You will have to wait until it runs out or call Xbox and have them cancel your current. This wont stack on your subscription. At least it wouldn't mind. I advise waiting out your remainder.
1611	-1	dont download softwares from amazon. I dowloaded and it but couldnot install it properl and amazon is not going to help you with that and they are least bothered and they dont even refund your money
1612	1	Getting a REAL discount is great! My smile of the day!<br />Filler words to get nine required to submit this review
1613	1	Thanks fast as lightning!!
1614	1	Versus other S&F games this was just plain fun to do from beginning to end. I was never bored. If I compare it with other S&F Games that are boring by repeat areas when a games is half done this just continued with great graphics of change and place. Yes you get use to the game overtime but that happens with any game. Get it!
1615	-1	Codes don't work and for those moaning about bad reviews, the process of buying the codes is part of the purchase and so we are entitled to leave 1 star scores if only to warn other buyers.
1616	0	I suppose for an afternoon when there is nothing else to do, this would be fine...I'd rather watch a couple of episodes instead!!<br />I really wish I hadn't purchased it at all!!!
1617	1	The starter pack includes some useful items. The most important is the cerebral accelerator which will vastly boost your skill training, but only for a limited amount of time.
1618	0	awesome
1619	-1	I didn't get my code help anyone??
1620	1	Using the free trial version, I was hooked and it seems like a good game.  Only when I purchased the full version it locked up, and even after rebooting my computer TWICE and downloading the game TWICE it was still locked on the same screen.  Very annoying!  Hopefully after un-installing and re-downloading it will actually work this time??
1621	0	Bought it for the tablet capabilitiy. It's cluncky and boots you out even at lower graphics settings. OK with attached keyboard.
1622	-1	Would rather a disk.  There always seems to be a problem with online codes.  Would not have purchased without a disk, but its the only way its sold and my granddaughter really wanted it.
1623	0	"When i got this game, there was no new update for my Nvidia GeForce GT 620 graphic card. I tried that when my mouse was invisible when i opened the game. The old graphic driver was published in 2012 and this game came out in 2010.  Amazon does not accept returns on downloaded games and support is nil for this game at Amazon or at the game's site. As usual, I got the best information from blogs, although, this particular game was not discussed much. The \\""much\\"" was about mouse problems. A week after i bought the game, I checked again, and since the last time i checked, a new update had come out for the graphic card. I updated, and the mouse appeared.<br /><br />The game is ok, certainly better than i could have written, but not quite as fun as solitaire."
1624	1	EXCELENT GAME, THE BEST IMAGES
1625	-1	I decide to give it one star because I cannot download it. Some more words to reach 20. Repeat words don't count.
1626	-1	refused to load no matter how many times I tried, it does not inspire me to get the full game.
1627	0	Was a complete letdown. Always enjoyed Manager games but EA has ruined it by sucking the fun out of it. Not as great as previous editions. Looks better and the teams are updated - that's about it. Wish they would continue updating squads even when they launch 13.
1628	1	Saves you money whats not to like
1629	-1	After such a long wait for this game, get ready to wait some more even after purchasing it. All day, just like everyone else, you cannot connect to a server OR it gets stuck at the load page and EA's fix is delete your user data and try again.<br />If you are going to require users to connect to a server, YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THE SERVERS ARE THERE TO CONNECT TO.
1630	0	Chicken Invaders was okay for what it cost me. I got it as a free game during Amazon's free daily game promotion. The graphics are rudimentary, and the controls are decent. There is a massive advantage of mouse control over the keyboard, however. I found it fun to play with my younger brother, as a timewaster. It's not very robust, but then again, it was free. There isn't much variation among the levels.
1631	-1	I recently bought this on Christmas and was trying to get the bonus map that came with it and it turns out there is none so save you money and buy it in store. seriously this is 2nd time I've been ripped of so trust me it's worth just going to the store.
1632	-1	Though it is a good game single player wise, if you are thinking of buying this game, think twice....<br />I bought it a little over a week ago, and was having trouble playing coop and versus mode on line.<br />I thought it was just a settings issue, and it is partly in my case, configuring the fire wall on my router<br />with the tcp and udp port settings as per Ubisoft's recomendations did not correct the issue.<br />I could connect to the online servers and join the lobbys and talk to or text the other players in the lobby,<br />but as soon as the game was launched and the map finished loading, I was instantly disconnected.<br />This happened every single time without fail. I even had my friend create a lobby with just us in it and we tried to play coop but both of us were disconnected as soon as the map finished loading.<br />So I contacted Ubisoft Tech support and gave them all the details on the issue and all the corrective measures I had already followed, and this was what I got as a reply from them:<br /> Response Henry J. via Email 09/27/2012 04:12<br />Hello,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Ubisoft Support. It seems that the servers for the game are being shut down. The maintenance and operations of online services will be stopped for Splinter Cell Chaos Theory on the 30th of September. From that day forward, you will not be able to play the game online anymore due to the amount of time the game has been released. The team is gearing up for the next iteration of the Splinter Cell series.<br /><br />Sorry for any inconveniences,<br /><br />Henry<br />Ubisoft Support
1633	-1	This game literally made me nauseous to the point that I could no longer play it.  The fear visual effect and the warping of the game view made me want to puke and was annoying at best.
1634	0	Quick info for those running this on a Windows 8 PC...<br /><br />(1) DSFix is basically mandatory.  I was stunned at how terrible this looked on my monitor (1080p), but DSFix cleared it right up.  Thank goodness.<br /><br />(2) This will install Games for Windows Live.  However!  The version installed through Steam is NOT the right version for Windows 8.  Your game will crash on startup.  You need to uninstall both Games for Windows Live programs in your Uninstall list, then go to the Windows App Store and install the Games for Windows Win 8 App.  Then, it will work properly.<br /><br />(3) They say a gamepad is required.  They are *not joking*.  Mine has been ordered (the Rock Candy Xbox 360 one is inexpensive and well-reviewed).  This is hard for me - I'm a mouse/keyboard guy - but you need a controller if you don't have one.<br /><br />So with all that? I will finally get to play once my gamepad arrives.  I'll revise my rating then.  Right now, it's just reflective of the rather involved installation.  A modern PC game shouldn't require this many steps to work right.
1635	0	I've owned this game for a-couple days and to tell you all the honest truth i don't like this game one bit.  Its a total make over from part 1.  I loved part 1 of Victoria is was amazing.  THis game obviously covers political aspects which i don't like.  You have almost no controls from part 1.  Everything is different which is crazy.  But hey if you want to try this game out good luck because its a piece of work.  The tutorials suck anyways so try youtube to learn how to play.  At least they tried in this game, so pc games dont have sequels at all.
1636	0	should i have to put a credit card number after applying the redeem code?<br />and should i have to add an American billing address ? btw am not living in USA<br />and if i have too, is there is any way to get subscribed to psn plus like buy and add 50$ to my wallet and then buy 1 year subscription or it will need a American credit card too ???<br /><br />i need help please ,thanks
1637	-1	the code could not be used. is still preserved. please give a reason. could not be used sone latinoamerica country costa rica
1638	-1	Haven't been able yo play it yet. After an extensive download you are directed to a screen where you must buy more to use the game.
1639	1	"Although i got some of these games at the previous sale i didn't have to think twice to click the \\""Pay\\""button.<br /><br />i love this!!!<br />[[ASIN:B00A3F5S0O Tantalizing THQ Medley [Download]]]"
1640	1	Highly recommend to family and friends.. Very easy to use.. Love the fact that I didn't need to leave my home..
1641	1	well worth the price.. i bought them for $10 bucks.<br /><br />Just finished bioshock and borderlands, will work on bioshock 2 later.
1642	0	kinda fun, some objects are just impossible unless you use a hint,  but it's ok :-)  I know I won't play it a second time.
1643	1	Mass Effect 1(ME1) is great. Mass Effect 2(ME2) picks up the story and takes you on a thrilling adventure following our same hero as last time, Commander Shepard. If you have played ME1 you will be able to import a finished ME 1 save game straight into ME2, your well-known Shepard is freshly molded and is a familiar face.<br /><br />The depth of this interesting plot is amazing and expands on the thoughts and visions of the BioWare team behind the franchise. You, the player are in full control of Commander Shepards actions during the plot and in theory all endings are different according to what choices were made in ME1 and during ME2.<br /><br />If you enjoyed ME1 I'd say go for it. I, myself ended up loving ME2 even more than I loved ME1, to me, this is the best game of the trilogy. Followed by ME1. I'd recommend you pick up all three games and play them they way they are meant to be played.<br /><br />If you enjoy science fiction and great role-playing games, this may be a nice addition to your game library. If you think the third person shooter aspect of these games is of any sorts of importance, you'd be half wrong, half right.. There are many levels of difficulty. Are you here for the breathtaking story? Leave it on casual and quickly play through missions and enjoy all the great and sometimes humorous cut-scenes. Or take it all the way to insanity and replay the missions a millions times before completion is achieved. Or put it somewhere between to find just what suits your needs of this game. Great story and a fairly advanced combat system makes for a great cocktail served just as you wish.<br /><br />To returning players having played ME1, I'd say the most notable difference in ME2 is the addition of so called thermal clips for your weapons. These act like ammo in any other game and has removed the overload system from ME1, this isn't a big issue tho, if you ask me. They are scattered around on the missions so you shouldn't run out of rounds at.. Any pointreally.<br /><br />So it is up to you, to once again save the galaxy, this time from an even greater evil. The choice is yours, Commander.
1644	1	This is the greatest way to purchase points to buy download games from Microsoft.  Fast, you can do it from home and have it in minutes.  Definitely good for those who don't want to go out to get a game.
1645	0	Puzzle platformers on PC are a dime a dozen these days, and The Bridge does a decent job of standing out.  Each world takes a relatively simple idea & makes a series of levels with increasing difficulty which is great.  Problems arise that over time the puzzles got a bit repetitive as the player keeps trying slightly different placement/screen movement to find the solution.<br />It's not a bad game by any reach, but there are many more similar games out there that, to me, provided a more fun and rewarding experience as I progressed through them.<br />Recommended for hardcore puzzle fans, indie game fans and people who found Braid to be too easy. :)
1646	1	The longer you have it the more games you accumulate for free! It's well worth the price of $50 a year and you can usually find it for $40 around black friday~the holidays. One thing to keep in mind however is that you need to have an active PS+ subscription to access the free games you download; either way it's still a great value. Also several things on the playstation store are automatically discounted just by having a PS+ subscription.
1647	0	I really enjoyed the thematic content and artwork in this latest Build-a-Lot game.  It has pretty fairy-tale colors, and really well-done artwork.  The problem is that this is really the same old Build-a-Lot in different clothing.  The objectives are the same.  The gameplay is the same.  The developers really need to add some new elements to these games to keep me interested.  We're now at #6 in the series, and I feel like I'm playing the same game over and over again.  For those who crave more of what they loved in the first Build-a-Lot, then this is a slam dunk.  For those who are looking for some advancement and something new, there's not enough here to keep the long-time player interested.
1648	-1	The Max Payne 3 installation requires you sign up for a &#34;Social Club Account&#34;.  Then you fall into a &#34;problem linking your social club account to your steam account&#34; you can't get out of without stopping the process.  The LA Noire installation worked fine.  So now I have to go and figure out what is the solution to this problem with Max Payne 3.  I told myself I would never buy another game download from Amazon after the fiasco with Mass Effect 3.  Here I go to waste some more of my time because Amazon can't download a game without out some problem or other.
1649	1	this game is for my 4year old grandson i would like to get this before christmas. he [matthew] played it once and i think he could learn from this game 1penguin 100 cases. also he can help his sister [kaylee] learn from it. thank you , hope you can save one for me                              angel77_48@hotmail.com
1650	1	love it just to play when i am bored and just want to kill some time.
1651	-1	I BOUGHT THIS GAME AND I HAVE WINDOWS 7 ULTIMATE 64 BIT AND I TIRED INSTALL THE GAME AND HALF WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS.AN ERROR HAS OCCUR AND TRIED RE DOWNLOADING IT STILL NO IMPROVEMENT.GAME HAS A ISSUE THUR AMAZON I CANT SEEM GO GET THEM TO FIX IT OR MONEY BACK.IF I TRY TO INSTALL IT WITH AMAZON DIGITAL IS CANNOT INSTALL GAME MY ISSUE IS CITYXL201\PAKS FILES HAVE A ERROR SOMETHING IS MISSING.I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE DOWNLOAD HER IS ONLY 3.4 GB DOWNLOAD BUT THOUGHT OTHER P;ACES IS ONLY 4.8 GB WHY DON'T KNOW
1652	0	The game involves a lot of repetitive gathering of &#34;gems&#34; which are quite visible on every screen. This takes little skill except getting the cursor on target. Then it takes a couple seconds for the program to explain the significance of the gem (which is not really necessary to know for the story and takes up time). The puzzles often involve clicking on dense foliage to find a hidden object, but in contrast to many other HOG's I have played, frequently no part of the object is visible, so there is a lot of &#34;random clicking&#34; for which there is no skill required. The puzzles themselves often seem trial-and-error rather than problem solving. All in all I found it a disappointment (btw, my favorites are 1000 doors (first of the series), wierd tunes, the Sacra Terra series...mostly Alawar games).
1653	0	"Pros: Very good graphics and atmosphere. Worth the affordable price.<br />Cons: Frustratingly diffcult at times when the AI decides to just drown you with enemies.<br />As you probably already know, you don't control your soldiers directly. Instead you spend money on \\""bribing\\"" them into going somewhere, attacking or protecting things.<br />It's an intersting twist, because you need to ensure you have enough money to get things done when you need them done. But it is very frustrating seeing your soldiers walk past an important building being destroyed despite offering them a hefty amount of money to protect it. At least they respond most of the time. On the other hand, they like to run into dangerous situations and get themselves killed and you have no way to tell them to retreat. Overall it is fun to immerse yourself in this world.<br />P.S. There are no cheat codes. It would be more fun to be able to squeeze out a victory with an occasional cheat, then to feel you can't even get close when the AI just wears you down with waves of enemies."
1654	0	Update 7/3 -<br />I had noticed some graphical stuttering and FPS issues on the Mac client, but had chalked them up to server congestion and the 'newness' of the client. I expected a few quick patches to come out that would fix the issues. The game is playable, but it does suffer from some sever graphics issues and a few crashes. Graphically it reminds me of playing a game released in 2015 on a decade old machine - it's like the hardware just can't handle it. I should note that I have a late 2013 Retina Display MBP with dedicated graphics - I don't expect to run a game with completely maxed settings, but I shouldn't be having graphical issues at middle settings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems that SQEX jumped the gun on this release, they left an official statement for Mac Users:http://sqex.to/GgVn<br /><br />I look forward to reinstalling the Mac version once it is updated (next OS release that has a better Mac graphics engine won't come out until fall 2015 or so), until then I'll just stick to my PS4. I requested a refund via online chat with Amazon and will update the review if there are any refund issues.<br /><br />----Original Review----<br />Will update once I (hopefully) get resolution -<br /><br />Same issue as others. The code provided doesn't work for Mac, I contacted Amazon support and explained the issue and they issued me a new code, same problem - the code shows as invalid when you try to register for the Mac license, but shows as valid if you put it in for the Windows client. The rep i spoke to was aware of the lack of Mac download instructions and just gave the vague 'we're working on it'.<br /><br />I bought this using Amazon gift cards, so refunding and repurchasing from SQEX isn't an option for me, I'll have to contact SQEX support now (per Amazon) to have them resolve, but their customer service isn't actually open until 12pm EST.<br /><br />**UPDATE 12PM EST**<br />I didn't end up having to contact SQEX to get this fixed. I rechecked just now on Amazon and my product key had changed from earlier. I wasn't sent any email confirming this or given any indication it was changing/fixed but the new key worked on the Mog Station to add the Mac license. It also added 30 days free game time (not sure if this is a glitch, a bonus for the inconvenience or because it's a bundle and you normally get 30 days for adding ARR to your account).<br /><br />Better yet - the installation instructions have been updated to now have the correct Mac Downloader link - which I can't even find on SQEX site: http://square.vo.llnwd.net/o2/ffxivhw/ffxiv_hw_installer.dmg<br /><br />Corrected to a 5/5 :)ny email confirming this or given any indication it was changing/fixed but the new key worked on the Mog Station to add the Mac license.

1655	1	If you enjoyed Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion, this game IF YOUR YOU. No, it's not a classic adventure. But it's the same GREAT creator behind. It's a game very fun, imaginative and with a lot of replay valor.
1656	-1	The game seems very cheap, it doesn't control well, and in general it's bad.  The actual 3d ghostbusters game that came out around 2008 or so (actually written by Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramsis) is way better.  Get that instead.
1657	0	civ 5 has too many new features without keeping good old features, i dont know, i just liked 4 better, graphics dont matter in civ since all graphics do is slow down the game.
1658	1	This is a late but short review. The game is awesome! I haven't played FPS for a long time (I'm more into RPG like Neverwinter Nights, Diablo 2/3, Dragon Age, RTS like StarCraft 1/2, WarCraft, and Simulations like Cities in Motion, The Sims, and SimCity). Last time I did was back in the golden days of Counterstrike and Unreal. I bought this coz my brother has it and I wanted to play with him. It took me some time to relearn FPS gameplay. Once I got the hang of it, I didn't realise that I played it for hours already! Just a word of caution, this game highly-addictive! :)
1659	0	feel like if u r playing it on the ipad
1660	0	Fair interface but not intuitive enough for me.  Seek the truth while it may be found.  What if one gains the whole world but loses his soul?
1661	0	It was just ok, I didn`t find it challenging enough to keep my interest. Younger and newer player might like it.
1662	-1	This game would be a pretty good game...IF IT WAS PLAYABLE!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />This game stutters hard which makes it unplayable!! even with all settings turned to low!!!<br /><br />Now before people say &#34;its your pc&#34; well it ain't<br /><br />I have a 7950 with i5 2500K
1663	0	I finished the game and now I have no desire to play it anymore.  Maybe a year from now.  Who knows?
1664	1	very glad I am able to purchase a subscription in this manner. It makes finances much easier for me. Go xbox!
1665	0	I like the game but had a hard time getting downloaded right.  Would work and then stop.  Had to do it several times before it started working right.  Enjoy it but not my favorite.
1666	-1	This piece of gamework is slow, boring and predictable. The only thing it has going for it is better graphics than its ancestor, 1620 AD/Anno 1620. It has an in-your-face-all-the-time gameplay coach/questgiver. Makes ya wanna shoot the actor spewing it. A warning from 5 students in my dorm who've tried it: a 10 thumbs down.
1667	1	"Best Hidden Object/Mystery/Puzzle game played so far. Well worth the price of admission! Not everyone that plays these games is twelve years old, this is a great game for anyone of any age that enjoys whiling the hours away, challenging the mind. Let's hope more developers take note. Obviously only a special few can make a \\""Myst\\"" series or \\""Siberia\\"" series. This game helped take up some of the slack."
1668	0	"I have been with The Sims franchise since the very first game and I have every installment, expansion and item pack. This is a fun expansion pack, but unlike Nightlife and Ambitions it does not contain an additional world or additional careers. It does allow additional activities such as Prom, Graduation, learning to drive etc. but you don't actually get to see any of them, only some commentaries during.   The newest addition, boarding school, is probably my favorite add-on as I love having big families, but after awhile they can be a bit tiring, now I can just ship them off to one of several boarding schools that will grow specific talents like logic, athleticism, art/music etc.   You can also create an imaginary friend that, if treated properly, can even become a controllable player and member of the family.   I like this expansion, but it isn't one of my favorites. It is definitely not worth $30. I'm very glad I used a coupon that took off $15 otherwise I would feel very cheated.   My advice is to wait for Sims Pets to come out before you purchase this as there will be a price drop on Generations since it won't be the \\""new one\\"" anymore.   If you're a Sims lover like I am you'll definitely want to add this to your collection, but if you're only a part-time gamer I'd just skip it and get either Nightlife or Ambitions because they'll give you much more bang for your buck."
1669	1	within minutes and the program needed to run it (Origin) is free and quick to download. Installation takes it time but that is because you are getting three games for the price of one. Enjoy the MASS EFFECT
1670	0	It is just okay...
1671	1	if you love bf3 , you should also love the premium which if offered.<br />it comes with all current and upcoming DLCs.<br /><br />what i don't really like this premium is , if you previously bought LE edition of BF3 which comes with B2K , you are still paying the same price for it ...<br /><br />in the end i still get it ~ :)<br />so , just enjoy the game ~
1672	-1	none of the decisions that you have made over the course of all three games, hundreds of hours and dollars, matters in the end. Call it false advertising, terrible writing, whatever. The thing that set ME series apart from other games was the promise that your choices matter. In fact, Bioware has told its legions of loyal fans that it the last ten minutes nothing you have done in the past matters. Makes me sick to my stomach the false advertising for five years.
1673	-1	NO REFUNDS allowed on downloadable software so I am out $10. Played it 3 times and it froze on me in diffrent areas every time. The free demo was more fun to play. I'd purchase the game on a disc before the downloadable content.
1674	0	THEY SHOULD HAVE RELEASED THE NEXT GEN VERSION OF 2K, THIS IS A TRIMMED DOWN CONSOLE PORT. ONLY BUY THIS GAME IF YOU CAN'T PLAY IT ON A CONSOLE.
1675	-1	As the previous review states, this product without a registration key is free to download from the game website. The description supplied by Amazon,  with the item for sale clearly indicates that it comes with the normal features that, according to the game website, require a registration key to access. It seems they are presenting a free version under the impression that it is a retail version.  To all intents and purposes, the sales pitch by Amazon Digital Services clearly hint at additional benefits ( clearly stated in the description) that are not available with the free version (according to the game website). These additional benefits are only available with a registratio key that Amazon will not supply to me.  When I contacted Amazon, they did not seem interested and referred me to the game website. In my books, that is mis-representation and Amazon not taking responsibility for the goods it sells. At the same time I purchased another MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, which did come with the required key.   I am a heavy user of Steam and during all the years I have purchased from them, I have never had an issue. Amazon looked like they could end up with a lot of my business, but after this experience, I will not be riskng my money with Amazon again.  Final note for Amazon. As the retailer, if you are not willing to rectify such issues, then what advantage do you offer over other digital retailers? It may be a few bucks less here, but that is not worth the saving, if Amazon are not willing (as the Retailer) to address the issue. Why take the risk to buy here if the support lacks!!!
1676	0	If you want to have the true Battlefield 3 experience,<br />then buy this game on a console. When you launch<br />the application it sends you to a web browser. Then<br />you have to figure out how to launch the game from<br />their. Don't waste your hard owned cash.
1677	1	I'll be honest, when I first turned the game on, I wasn't sure I liked it. I didn't like the Bots, I thought the matches were too short, and I wasn't too thrilled with the 6 on 6 team size.....<br /><br />Fast forward several hours, and as I have gotten used to the flow of game play, it has completely grown on me, and I can't put it down. I have come to understand that the reason for the 6 man teams, is to enable instant respawn and to ensure you always spawn close to action. I have also found that the matches are plenty long enough in the pilot hunter game mode. It was just the attrition game mode that had matches that just seemed short.<br /><br />As for the bots, I've grown used to them, and they're actually not that big of a deal. The game is much more challenging to me than BF4 and also more enjoyable.<br /><br />The graphics won't blow your mind, but they're plenty good IMHO. Could use some better textures though.<br /><br />I do recognize that this title might not be for everybody, but for me, I have absolutely no regrets in making the purchase. If you don't like it at first, give it a little time, maybe your mind will change just like mine.
1678	-1	It's not that I hate the game, I was unable to download with Safari on iPad but thought I would receive it on my computer.  No such luck.  Could it be sent again?
1679	-1	There is some form of error that gives an issue when trying to play Mass Effect 1 on windows 7.  ME3 multiplayer works fine but as the first doesn't. I look around online there are some fixes and i'm not the only one having this issue. It is possible that there is conflict with Origin.
1680	1	This game gives you options and choices.  You can haggle and bargain and set your own prices.  You can play the game over and over and make different choices.  Some games once you have gotten to the end then it doesn't change but this one does.  The same items are there but you make the choice of what items to choose and buy.
1681	-1	I was never able to download this game, so I gave up and went and bought it at Target.  Yet, Amazon still charged me even though I sent emails to all the different contact areas listed.  If you have Windows 8 DO NOT buy this download.  You will lose your money and still not be able to download the game!
1682	0	Gives me more variety along with the games I've already installed.For the old school players it's worthy.Certainly worth the cost.
1683	-1	I payed $20 dollars for this game. First I had a download problem: &#34;Unable to reach Amazon&#34; or something along those lines. When it finally downloaded and installed I couldn't (and still can't) get the CD key to work. When I open games for windows live it says that I don't have a valid key even though I payed for the game and used the key that Amazon supplied me. This is absolutely ridiculous. I want my money back.
1684	1	Before even starting the campaign, 16 hrs were logged into the multiplayer with a friend. That alone was worth the price of this game. I haven't finished the campaign however its irrelevant if i enjoy then ending or not given that the multiplayer is quite enjoyable.
1685	1	Just buy it then get the code and enter it into your xbox and done. It's fast and easy like it should be.
1686	-1	Background:<br /><br />1. EA was aware of the number of games sold by preorder and presumptively capable of being able to calculate sales at launch. This is one of the primary functions of their marketing department.<br />2. EA did not adjust download capacity at launch to meet these requirements.<br />3. EA did not adjust server capacity to meet the on-line play requirements at launch or subsequent to launch.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />1. EA deliberately launched a game which they knew they could not fully (or even in part, apparently) support.<br />2. EA deliberately sold a game which they knew its customers would not be able to play in full or in part for some period of time, to be determined, after launch.<br />3. As many have pointed out in the past, this is effectively fraud. Deliberately selling a product that does not work is unacceptable in almost any industry, and should be considered criminal.<br />4. These actions show once again that EA treats its customers with complete contempt. It has been rated as the worst company in America in 2012 for good reason.<br /><br />Solution:<br /><br />1. Do not buy this or any other games from this EA.<br />2. Do not buy this or any other game requiring on-line play for single player games.<br /><br />This is the only way they will pay attention. As long as we continue to give them money, they will continue to perpetrate this fraud. Hit them in the wallet and they will wake up in a hurry. Do it now, before these greedy companies ruin what is left of the gaming industry.<br /><br />BTW, thank you Amazon, for allowing refunds on this game. This will help send the message to EA and companies with similarly unethical practices.
1687	0	I have Clutter II and enjoy that one a lot, this one is just a half star less because it is the first version
1688	-1	A waste of money. Very retro but who cares.
1689	-1	"First off the game has improved somewhat since launch. When they launched it you couldn't play at all. Now they have extra servers so you can play, but they have disabled a lot of key region features like resource transfer to other cities. Those kinds of things update once an hour if you are lucky - sometimes not at all and your resources go poof - and this is all because this game REQUIRES an internet connection to play. All of the trades between cities are handled over the internet, but the servers in charge of doing it aren't doing very well.. That said, you can still build a city, so with that in mind I would have given this game a 3 star review..<br /><br />BUT!<br /><br />You can't reliably SAVE your progress!!<br /><br />So, what is the point of building a city only to have it \\""roll back\\"" every time you come back to play the game? It doesn't matter how you build it, there are no work arounds. The internet side of the game is bugged beyond belief and cannot handle simple city saves. So you may be able to play a city for a few hours, but when you come back to it next time it will be busted broken and sometimes completely deleted. So what is the point of playing a SimCity without saving your progress?? I guess it would be fun if you were content to never save the cities you built, but in that case the price for this product should be more like $5, not $60."
1690	0	I love this game. But before you buy it here, check to make sure it's not available for cheaper on Steam. I could have saved myself a few bucks if I had thought to do that!
1691	-1	This took me several hours to figure out. Turns out, this game doesn't work / display if you have multiple monitors enabled (and aren't using eyefinity to make the displays appear as one).  In order to play the game, I have to disable one of my monitors. Then play the game. Then enable the monitor again. This isn't the only issue with this game. If they didn't even test the game on multi-monitor rigs, it's easy to see that they probably didn't test a lot of other scenarios.  Even after a couple years, no patch to fix this has been released.
1692	1	One of the best games I've played. Do not expect game changing features in this one, but it will certainly be fun to play for anyone that enjoyed the first two...
1693	0	Graphic problems and compatability issues but still love the game.
1694	-1	It's really a pin in the as that you MUST have a credit card to pay for it. You can't even use a Debit card. That's the dumbest S$&* ive ever heard... A credit car is REQUIRED for something so simple. How come xbox isn't like that?? cause Xbox is better, and i ALWAYS knew xbox was better, i just knew it.
1695	1	Amazingly entertaining game. And yes it is the full game but not any of the add-on content. Worth every dollar.
1696	0	So, for those who have played PC games, you probably know the Good. awesome graphics. nice storyline.<br />I am still on the fence as to whether I will continue to pay the $14.99 a month fee to play this.  Why?  the bad is starting to truly interfere with the gaming.  I'm not talking about the silly mounts where the graphic people just did the minimum.  Or the really really awful maps that phase in and out.<br />What is so surprisingly bad is the customer support.  no matter what issue comes up that requires you to contact them, you will wait days for an email response. Which is a form letter. That does not help in anyway.  And you will have to reply to that and wait some more.<br />I am astounded by their customer support. Absolutely astounded.<br /><br />The graphics are truly incredible and realistic looking.  But if I can't even log on, what is the point of the graphics?  smh...<br /><br />For you PlayStation People, I understand from on-game convos that this is not such an issue for you all.  The game was made for Playstation and is trying to go online to get the PC crowd.  However, so far, I have encountered very few PCers.  maybe they can't log in either?
1697	0	Ruff release but considerable effort on the part of the developers to set things rite. Still needs work but very playable in multiplayer,single player not so good. If you have played any of the Rainbow six titles up to and including Ravenshield you won't be impressed with the single player side of this game.
1698	-1	I downloaded and it will not play, computer says this program is missing files<br />I even deleted and downloaded over again and again and still the same thing.
1699	0	Can't very well complain about a free lunch and this was free, so it's acceptable.  I have had no problems with it.
1700	-1	This game is alright. I played the free trial and luckily did not buy it. Otherwise, it would be a bad buy. Graphics are poorly draw with one dimension (flat images) instead of three dimensions that provide better graphics quality or more in-depth of the real images. If you want good game, you should download Campfire Legend Babysitter.   Game cover looks great but actual game wasn't anything comparing to its cover.
1701	0	It is not include all DLC and some DLC in this bundle look like cheating game (I don't know in first time). It make game boring :(
1702	1	I like role playing games, but in this game, you are more like an overseer or a god in charge of everything....too much for me.  If you like the building and prepping part you'll love it.
1703	0	Wildstar is a mixed bag. The game mechanics are fun and engaging at first. It's more action oriented than tradition WoW based games. However, the game is very grind oriented and focused on End Game Raiding and group PVE content. If that's your bag and you don't mind a sub fee, you may love this game, for me it was too much time sink to justify the 15$ monthly fee.
1704	1	The game is great, the engine works amazingly (mantle), the interface for changing settings, navigating main menu, etc. works in a snap without any delays or hints of animation. However there are occasions where the game will freeze, stutter for half a minute, and even worse everytime I join a match theres always some guy screaming into the mic or using an open mic with a terrible mic; I cant change the settings to mute everyone by default which really sucks. Overall though the game is fun and pretty awesome as well.
1705	0	old game but still fun to play
1706	-1	Bought a Mac some days ago, and wanted to buy The Sims. I've chosen to buy here because I had some gift cards. Nice, downloaded and installed. But when I open it, it says that an unknown error has occurred. I've seen in the internet that there are many people with this problem and I didn't find any solution. I've downloaded Origin 2 times and The Sims 4 or 5, cleaned my SSD but nothing works. Yes, my Mac is OK to play this game. If someone has a solution for my problem, please, help me. clarissa@ipodschool.com<br /><br />Thank you
1707	-1	game wont open after the dwn load and the istall so whats up with that? cant get money back neither
1708	0	A good game, not played by many sadly.
1709	-1	so much work to put into such a negative game... ugg.
1710	1	perfect
1711	1	this product was awesome it really works its totally recommended fgdfghdfhgdhfghgfh fgd dgfd d g dth dhd dhh dhdt  dfg
1712	-1	There is nothing wrong with it steam so why are they using this crap?  Origin.... I wasn't able to install the game because of it install freezes at 99%... I wasnt able to install any game from origins because of it .....
1713	-1	There is something about this game that is not just right; I have made several digital download purchases and very happy with all of them except this one; I did receive a Windows Warning (Windows7) when installing the game and ignored it; but I'm pretty sure that this game has some type of tracking, malware, adware, or something bundled with it.  I would not recommend this purchase.
1714	1	works as expected. got a code emailed right away. would recommend to anyone over driving to a store and dealing with weather/traffic
1715	-1	"Waste of $40 that should have been unlockables in the Station Store.<br /><br />\\""Expansion\\"" should be considered false advertisement. It's more of a way for them to get the last $30-40 from each player before the game finally dies off.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong i've played EQ2 since 2004. But this has to be the biggest disappointment since release. :("
1716	1	The download took forever, and then when i finally thought it was done it had to download more things. This happened several times. However, the game works great on my macbook pro (snow leopard). If you want the game, get it.
1717	1	Its GTA what else can you say.
1718	0	Ok game.  Good deal.  Not WoW.  I got bored quickly with this game and haven't played it very much.
1719	0	this game is a value because it's a bargin at 3 for 1 price. my only problem is that the objects that are hidden are very small, very hard to see. if you have 20/20 vision the buy is a bargin.
1720	0	GODS:  Lands of Infinity is a game made by people who didn't seem to know exactly what to make. What you get is a strange mix of two genres with a really horrible marketing scheme.<br /><br />First, the marketing. You may have heard the #1 marketing item about this game. It's main character was modeled by and voice-acted by a pornography actress. Why did they market that? She is a very pretty girl, but a very horrible voice-actor. And since this is a game built for 13 and up, it's rather inappropriate to make mention of her dubious past. Don't worry, there's no nudity in the game (as far as I've seen).<br /><br />Now, the strange mix of genres:<br /><br />Turn-Based Combat Fantasy RPG:<br />This game has an older style of turn-based combat. It's a bit similar to some old Final Fantasy games. Most of the combat is plain attack-attack-attck. But as you progress, the combat is actually very strategic. It's really in the strategic combat that the game gets its best flavor.<br /><br />The fantasy is typical cliche type stuff that you'll find filling the gaming libraries of the 80's and 90's. And the story is pretty basic, but not terribly annoying.<br /><br />RPG elements are almost all flawed. The characters are flat. The voice acting is rotten. The visuals are hit-and-miss. The music is annoying. It makes you eat and drink copious amounts to stay alive. If it's a bad idea in an RPG, it's probably found here.<br /><br />Economy Sim:<br />Each town has its own economy and inter-town trade affects the economy. So you'll spend a lot, if not most, of your time going from town to town buying and selling goods to buy things. You can make a bit of money from questing and other typical RPG-type activities, but not much. So you'll probably end up as a trader who carries tiny amounts of goods from place to place.<br /><br />The economy sim aspect of the game ruins it. It's a neat addition, but it takes real work to trade. And who wants to work when you're playing a game?<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Here's the strange kicker of it all:  you actually might enjoy some of this game. There's enough fun in the game to actually have fun. There's tons of other games that are more fun, but if you really want to try this game out, you'll probably at least have a few good hours with it before quitting. And if you suffer through some more of it, there's a pleasantly cliche story that unwraps for you.<br /><br />What's great about GODS is that it employs some of the traditions in old-school RPGs that are just not around today. And it's a little nice to revisit some of those, if not to remember why most have let them be forgotten.game. There's enough fun in the game to actually have fun.

1721	1	These PSN cards are really good for people like me who aren't on the USA anymore and have a credit card that is being declined by the PS Store system (don't know why). 10/10 - Willl buy it again soon
1722	1	Hey what can I say, it is a game code.  Got it and applied it all went well with no problems.  I like my little flying pet.
1723	1	Leave your guns at home, folks. Turn off the lights, turn up the sound, and enjoy the tense gaming moments.
1724	1	Love this game, definitely buy it.  Storyline is great, gameplay is great, ending is awesome, like a real movie. 5 stars across the board!
1725	-1	Initial install and set-up was fine, but as soon as I tried to play an actual match, the whole game crashed. Followed Amazon help-desk advice: reinstalled etc etc, but same thing every time. No help from EA and I haven't got time to waste on this, so I've given up. Don't waste your money!
1726	0	As the title says. I've updated my system, re-downloaded and re-installed the exe, and even tried changing the file paths. Nothing. I've heard nothing but good things about this game but looks like I'll never know.<br /><br />*update* After searching around and testing fixes I was able to launch successfully after installing xnafx31_redist located in the Bastion install folder.
1727	-1	the code I was given did not work
1728	1	Great game. Downloaded without a problem.
1729	1	Fast and secure! All like I expected, totally worth it
1730	0	It's fun, but gets old quickly. I guess being used to the console versions of GTA, I am be a little biased.
1731	1	Best PS VIta game of 2013.  Epic boss battles, high action, and stealth moves. ANd its cross-Play to...so best deal ever
1732	-1	Not enough content released
1733	0	Not too bad for the price!
1734	1	This has been great with my kids.<br /><br />The only thing about these downloads is after a few months or so if you try to download it to another computer the file is corrupted and you get a trojan or some other virus warning.  Buy a disc if its available.
1735	0	There's nothing special about this. There's not enough shows to the character to make good money. Would buy it again though.
1736	1	I choose that rating because i get the code very quick and safe . So thank you for your services and hope you all the best.
1737	1	Its the fastest way to get your Xbox live gold membership. No need to leave the house or wait for the card to be mailed to you.
1738	0	At least there is replay value with this version... you have a couple factions to choose from, plus all the trophies you can get... this is one game that'll last a while. Now if only one of my ladies will have triplets....
1739	-1	"As with the other reviewers I as unable to activate the software because the activation server was down. Amazon claims no responsibility as they are \\""only the middle man\\"". It was Amazon who billed my credit card and Amazon provides no contact information to obtain a refund or working software."
1740	0	Hi all.  I decided to try this game since it was only $4.99 today.  I've never played any Mortimer Becket before and have very little gaming experience when it comes to hidden object games.  I enjoyed the game, but it was indeed short. There were a couple of places that I got stuck for a while, but for the better part of the game is was pretty easy.  By the end of the game it was feeling a bit formulaic.  Overall, I'm glad I purchased the game at its discounted price, but I would not have given it a chance for much more than that.
1741	0	Could be better been playing over a year and half.. doesnt keep me in the game much.
1742	0	nice, not timed, no 'steam' register requirement.  not complex.
1743	1	I know i'm late to the party, but this game is awesome.  Too often games get boring quickly because they do not immerse you in a great story.  This is a first person shooter that has a deep, troubling story.  It's not just shooting things endlessly.<br /><br />There were some nights when i couldn't fall asleep because I kept thinking of this game!<br /><br />Remember to play BioShock Infinite if you haven't already.
1744	-1	This game is poorly designed for new multi core cpu computers.  It lagged out my AMD 6 core with dual Asus video cards!  I was hoping for so much more form this game!
