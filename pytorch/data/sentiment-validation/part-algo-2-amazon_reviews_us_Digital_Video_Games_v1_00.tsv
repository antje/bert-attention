0	-1	The characters are 1-dimensional. The setting of the story is bland and uninspired. The storyline is just like other that Herinteractive have done. For the price it's appropriate, but as an installment of the Nancy Drew series it is an embarrassment.
1	1	I ran out of Xbox Live Gold the day before I bought this and purchased the 3 month code sometime the night after. Got an email saying everything was fine and got my code seconds later. Entered the code on the Xbox Live site to redeem it, and 20 minutes later was able to connect again. Would recommend buying this if you need Gold without going to a store as it is extremely easy and convenient!
2	0	the graffics of the game were dull and hard to find the objects which is yes the object of the game but after a hour of playing I would get eye strain and have to stop playing. And one of the games wouldn't load all of the way. It was still a fun game .
3	-1	SUCK
4	1	Thank you it's amazing item
5	-1	I purchased this game from Amazon and then proceeded to complete the download.  Once the download was complete I attempted to install the game and it required me to insert the disc before I was able to install and play the game.  I made the information known to Amazon and they only told me that this was an issue with EA Games and to contact them.  I have received no help from either Amazon or EA Games.
6	-1	Tried and tried. It said it downloaded but it never did. What I did manage to download locked up my computer and I was forced to delete it.  I was very disappointed.
7	-1	The game has none of the free will that makes the Sims what it is. You basically get told what to click on and then have to click on it... and the game ends. You don't get to develop a lot of things on your own. Its really bad. And boring.
8	0	My 10 year old son son is dictating this review to me so here goes: &#34;The graphics were a little sucky&#34; ; &#34;I love the game because I got to create my own battles&#34; and  &#34;The campaign was a little hard even on easy setting&#34;
9	0	I can't get past the 'river'!  The 5th board, I think.  I won't ever be able to finish this game unless I buy a new mouse.  Mine isn't fast enough on the trigger.  For the money it's not the worst game I've ever played and by far not the best one either.
10	1	For a platform game, it is not like the other lara croft' in as such it is not a one person player, it is platform based. It has decent graphics and the puzzles are cool for the price I paid for them, it was on like four bucks though, so for four bucks you can't go wrong.
11	1	Very good game enjoyed it Very much good graphics. it has some very interesting missions. this game got bad reviews I don't know why.
12	0	Nothing special about this game. It has all the classice Final Fantasy story, gameplay and animation but has a very generic MMO feel. Nothing makes this stand out against other games.
13	1	This Playstation Networ Store Gift Card  - PS3/ PS4/ PS Vita [Digital Code] is a  nice present to give for anyone.
14	0	Not bad, but not as good as others AC games
15	-1	This is another money-grab rip-off DLC from PS4. Don't waste your money!!
16	0	I played this game when it first came out and I fell in love with it. It was lots of fun. I used to to think the whole slow motion shots were pretty cool. I even beat the game and had fun with it.<br /><br />Now I purchased and downloaded Sniper Elite V2 and I can't even get past the first level. For some reason the music was just so annoying and repetitive, while the game play was so slow, I quit the game and uninstalled it. I couldn't believe it, was this the same game I played years ago, or have my tastes changed that dramatically?<br /><br />I'm not sure what changed, but I was not satisfied. I gave it three stars for the nice graphics update and the nostalgia, but this remake just isn't for me.
17	-1	Bad Game
18	1	A lot of fun to be had but it is slowed down by long waits at dungeons and lack of quests to really level up all your classes. A little too much grinding to really be what you want to be. Seems like a poor way to achieve longevity in the games
19	1	For Assassins fans and first timers alike, this is a beautiful open world with so much to do and explore. As you progress, more sidequests and activities become available to you. From assassins contracts, to naval battles, to diving missions and more, Black Flag takes a lot of risks where previous entries of the series lacked. Granted, I found myself purposefully engaging in hand to hand combat just for the sheer bliss of the killing blow animations. Exploring the vastness of the Carribean on your trusty naval steed is quite a treat and a larger aspect of the game as well. Leaping from a 3 story structure onto a duet of unsuspecting guards never gets old! Ubisoft's attention to detail is substantial in this gorgeous tropical setting. This is the best Assassins in the series by far!
20	-1	Purchased the game , installed( about 6 hours), created the ncsoft account, then press play, doo, nothing happens, your game not found in North America, lets try Europe, , nope you are not there iether, well lets go back to my emai's, maybe there is something i need to do, my ip locations its not sufficient, well let try inputting my location North America, network error unable to connect .............64.25.34.198.23115, well this suks..........not the best start of a game by far.
21	0	Syncing to the cloud sucks... Game could have been epic.  Instead I lost my entire game.  UNACCEPTABLE.
22	-1	This didn't work for me, was there something I was supposed to do?
23	1	I understand that security is ideal and necessary, but waiting for a digital code download shouldn't take up to 4 hours. I was excited to purchase MS points in this manner, but I'd just as soon buy the MS points cards instead. At least then I know for certain that my money will pay for the intended product. Worry not, I still love Amazon!
24	0	I love the game and got this to support the title and because I want more XCOM! This DLC is entertaining but also frustrating. The missions were fun and challenging plus you get an insane amount of loot after the last one. There are a couple of armor and hair skins added as well. But:<br />1)there are only three missions<br />2)you only get one chance to kick off the story. I skipped it in the first month because my squad was still pretty weak and couldn't shoot straight, the Council mission option for Slingshot never showed up again.<br />3)while it was cool to have new maps that actually looked like they were in China, it only highlighted the lack of distinction on the regular game maps: pine forests in every country, no deserts, jungle or arctic settings, American gas stations in Egypt, etc. They really need to release a map pack.<br /><br />You might want to wait for a sale on this one.
25	0	I dont like that cannot go back and repeat a certain section of the game without having to the start, game needs better save places or have the ability that the player can create a save where they would like.
26	0	Was for a gift but I played and the story mode is too short and boring
27	1	goodÔºÅ
28	1	Fun game. Graphics are better. Not top of the line, but good.<br /><br />Vehicles are fun and plenty of maps to try out.
29	-1	I got an invalid CD code from steam which was not worth the price of the game after all the work just to play it, it took hours. Just warning you fine people, never buy a game using this method again.
30	-1	Cancelled it, it was a scam to buy a sewing machine.<br />Don't have or use Playstation.
31	-1	"I suppose this is a case of knowing who you're buying from. I quickly purchased this from Amazon thinking I would be downloading the game from Amazon. Instead Amazon fulfills a voucher code to be redeemed on EA's origin store.<br /><br />I followed the instructions to download EA's client, create an account, enter the code... and nothing happens. The EA store consumed the code but doesn't register that the game is mine to download. Trying to use the code again, and it's no longer valid.<br /><br />[Edit: after an hour or so the \\""my games\\"" section updated and I was able to download the game. It's now installing, hopefully I can play soon.]<br /><br />Now in a queue to chat or speak with a customer service rep from EA. The forums are full of people with similar problems redeeming codes from physical copies purchased at retailers.<br /><br />If you're reading this on launch day I'd recommend waiting or doing the research I didn't do before (impulsively) buying the download thinking you could be playing quickly."
32	-1	could not get to activate asked for serial number wont except activation number
33	0	It was easy to beat..I beat it in one day, maybe should of paced myself better to get more time with it.
34	-1	not dice or the game / the problems with this do not buy this if you think its the Second Assault for play station or x box  because its some dowload for pc also the instant accses is for pc
35	1	So useful!!
36	1	Grandson loved this as a gift. The digital code was more convenient than going to the store and buying a card.
37	1	A fun expansion for Destiny fans!
38	-1	I just bought this game as part of a three-game download.  It was available when purchased, but not when I tried to download it.
39	-1	SimCity could be the best game in the world, but no one would ever know as the servers are never up.  I bought this game days ago and have yet to be able to play it.<br /><br />Edit:  Good news!  They patched the game several times and added new servers!  Now for the bad news...  the game is still literally unplayable.  I would love to see where my $60 went, as I know it wasnt going towards the games infrastructure.
40	-1	Sony should have allowed anyone with the previous game to get this for a few bucks. Sat down to play and it was over that night. We have all of the series (6 or 7 now) this was by far the biggest disappointment of them all. It was a transition between the two PS3 games.    Only positive was you learned how to do things for the Crack in Time game.    Unhappy Camper
41	1	PS PLUS is the one the best services you can get, and for just 50 bucks a year is a must have.
42	0	This game is what i would call 'simple fun'. Something just to kill time. It's so easy my bf's 6yo plays it! It's cute and fun. That's it. Mine didn't download fully either. Something that I didn't even notice at first. And it wouldn't fix when I tried to get it fixed which makes me think it's the game not the way it was downloaded. All-in-all I would say it's not worth the trouble. Sorry Agatha Christie - I love you anyway. :)
43	1	easy enough to play but at the same time the boards that you have to light do present a challenge.
44	1	Really great bundle! Bioshock 1 and 2 are really excellent games. Also Spec-Ops The Line might have some generic gameplay but the story and theme behind the games is something you don't see that much in this industry. Overall great deal!
45	1	Amazon did everything right on their part for this deal. EA and Origin is a different story.<br /><br />As always it is a terrible pain trying to get games to activate through Origin that were not purchased on it. In this case I bought the game on Amazon to save a lot of money and then went to activate it all through Origin so that all the files would be put in the same directory and to keep it simple in case I ever bought Mass Effect 3. If you guys want to do the same thing, expect Mass Effect 2 to activate fine but Mass Effect 1 to fail. You'll have to then waste 20 minutes to an hour and create an account on Pogo so that you can link it to your EA account so that you can then get it on your Origin account (Took an hour in my case since Origin's sucky live chat support caused the first person I explained the situation to to have chat issues on his end and he ended the live chat for no reason forcing me to begin again with someone else). This of course makes no sense due to the fact you'll be using Origin's application to run the customer service live chat and they should be able to add the game to your account through their program, wouldn't you think?<br /><br />So again. Amazon did fine. I've heard people have had issues downloading the game through them in other reviews on here but since I chose a different route I can't blame them. They just saved me nearly $30.
46	0	listed as a sandbox game because you get to pick a few things, but the order you do your tasks and HOW to do them is predetermined and very linear. the game however is fun, and the &#34;story&#34; is entertaining.
47	0	It's a bit more basic than I thought, but is refreshingly simple after challenging myself to more involved games. Nice sometimes just to shoot something.
48	-1	Didn't download correctly, not a fan at all!
49	1	"I've just finished this game, and overall it was pretty entertaining.<br /><br />It's a  quest-based hidden object game with beautiful graphics and a creepy atmosphere, if you're into that type of thing. This HOG would be appropriate for older kids and adults. The storyline itself is hilariously convoluted. Seems to have been hacked together by several of the designers.<br /><br />Note that this game does differ from most other hidden object games I've played in the following ways:<br /><br />There is no time limit when you are playing the hidden object aspect of the game.<br />The first hidden object in the list is usually a two-step process - you have to find one object, then use it to activate/complete a second object to get you to the final object you are looking for. The rest of the list is conventional find and click, but that first item challenge adds a nice bit of interest.<br /><br />This game is heavy on non-HOG mini games and puzzles. To progress in this game, you are more motivated to play the mini games to win objects needed to complete/unlock areas you've visited (you can usually skip the mini game after a timer bar fills up). Towards the end of the game, you can't bypass a couple tricky challenges in order to progress. If you don't like to be challenged by mini games or puzzles, then this game may not be for you.<br /><br />You will have to use the clue feature.  There are some areas where you'd have no idea what to do unless you use the clue. The number times you can use the clue feature seems unlimited, but  it is timed before you can use it again. There have been only one or two spots where I've had to use back-to-back clues.<br /><br />The game ran pretty glitch free on a Vista based system - I was able to pick up right where I left off. When I completed the game, the \\""Task List\\"" still showed several tasks that I had completed, and the payoff at the end of the game was nothing special, other than 'you made it through'. Again for me, the HOG scenes were very well drawn and made this game worthwhile.were very well drawn and made this game worthwhile."
50	-1	game is hard to play. there is no documents to tell you how to play<br />i will not recomend this
51	0	I enjoyed playing this game, as I do most hidden object games.  However, it was less challenging than others I have played.  I enjoy a good challenge!
52	1	Then you'll love the game. There's enough to keep you busy and the game graphics are nice enough as it's one of those games that aimed for realism rather than the cartoon style graphics of say - Guild Wars, which I also like a lot.<br /><br />It's being in Middle Earth and experiencing the story as a &#34;extra&#34; that's fun.<br /><br />85% of the content (as far as I can tell) is free to play. You can buy bag and stash extensions - or EARN them doing Deeds.<br /><br />There is some grind but any game that says &#34;no grind&#34; is lying and we all know it.<br /><br />Yes there is a Cash Shop - most games have these now so stop crying after the &#34;olden days&#34;.<br /><br />I didn't download it here so can't speak to that, I download off of Steam with FiOS so it was very fast - maybe 3 hours 15 minutes.<br /><br />Set it to download overnight, leave it be, don't compute and do other downloads while it's going. Common sense.
53	0	When I click play on my Steam profile, it says i installed the game and launches, but instead of jumping into the game, it instead's shows me a screen of it finishing the installation with the bottom bar saying 'done' but the top stays at 77% forever.
54	-1	This item was purchased by someone who hacked into my Amazon account. I did not buy this item.
55	1	Many hours have been played. I love this game. Be sure to google search for NAM (a free add on) which makes this game much more enjoyable. Fast download and good price.
56	0	Sadly a disappointment. I love The Elder Scrolls series but this game is like every other MMO. You grind, you cap, they add levels, you grind, you cap. No real freedom which is what makes TES and games like it enjoyable.
57	-1	Kingdoms of Amalur - Reckoning might be one of the coolest game ever, but I doubt I will ever know or play it. I purchased it yesterday from Amazon, and after waiting for 7.42GB to download, I got the option to install. Here I was thinking I'm installing the game itself and come to find out, it installs something called Origin. Then absolutely NOTHING happened. Now typically the average user at this point would be stuck. So I looked into the download folder and found a reckoning zip file. So I unzipped it and tried running the EXE and got right back to Origin. No explanation or reasons as to why I'm at Origin again. After searching extensively for what to do, I came across the instructions on creating the folders, what goes where and that Origin is the gateway to the game. So, I run Origin again, finally after 3 - 5 minutes (which is unacceptable lag)it has me create an account, I'm able to input my code and then nothing happened. Everything just sat there again. So I went and did digging on the Origin site and removed, rebooted, cleared cache and temp folders, reinstalled and now it won't accept the product code. So, I spend two hours on a chat with Origin support. After the first hour of trying a few things I got him to understand what he wanted me to do had already been done and the problem was with the product code being recognized but for some reason didn't attach itself to my account. After being told by support he'd be back in a minute, the chat window sat for an hour with nothing being done. Shut it down, uninstalled the game and asked Amazon for a refund. I was thinking of buying the game on disc, only to find out that the disc is nothing but a product code and you'd still have to go through the cluster **ck that is Origin. Here are a few things I did discover while searching for fixes, that downloading it and installing it from Origin supposedly works better, which means Amazon should either A) be directing you to Origin for the download, or, even better,B) stop selling the PC version. Also, all of this BS you go through with Origin is supposedly to prevent pirating of the game. Bad news EA/Origin/38 Studios - the pirates have already cracked this game and it's availabe through the torrent. And, no, I don't plan on getting the game there. It's never worth the effort, to me. I highly recommend 38 Studios find someone better to work with than EA/Origin if they wish a more successful entry into the PC market. They also have some of the WORST customer service ever.
58	0	This review contains spoilers for DS3 and its DLC.<br /><br />Good: it's a new atmosphere. The 200-year-old grimy ship differs greatly from the contempory-but-industrial Ishimura and the residential Titan Station. And you are in space quite a lot--more than in the other games, perhaps, as there's a lot of traveling between ships. It gives the game a different feel, but it's no different than the change between DS and DS2.<br /><br />Sargent John Carver is a great character. Without co-op play, you don't see many of his interactions with Isaac, but the ones that are seen are priceless.<br /><br />The weapon-crafting system is awesome, and the universal ammo was such a great move. It required more skill to have the right kinds of ammo, but you can only carry two weapons in DS3, and DS and DS2 would often give you other, unneeded ammo. The crafting in general is interesting.<br /><br />On that note, I like that the suits themselves are cosmetic, and your RIG must be upgraded by itself, but I'm sure some don't like this. After all, you end up lacking the built-in upgrades that some suits offered (ie, in DS2, certain suits made items cheaper or gave you a damage upgrade to certain weapons).<br /><br />Above all, it's still the same game: Isaac Clarke on a ship full of Necromorphs.<br /><br />Neutral: There are now human enemies to fight. Not good or bad, but definitely a change. It definitely marks the change to an action game. While the ending itself is way too easy, the last chapter before the end is quite hard. You'll die randomly, presumably from debris falling, even if your RIG is totally upgraded and completely full. It would stop me from playing the game on Hardcore mode, because even if you avoid enemies and just run through it, you will die. Maybe I'm missing something, but I've beaten the game many times on many different modes and always had this problem.<br /><br />(Possibly) bad: the horror elements are greatly reduced. There are many psychological horror aspects in the first two games, particularly Isaac's hallucinations and various gory sights. Since Nicole is dead, there's little for Isaac to hallucinate about. Much of the gore and horror (including hallucinations) return in the DLC, but are absent from this game. It's still scary, though, and I think it becomes scarier when you realize you have to destroy the whole planet/moon (much as it became scarier, I think, when you realize that Titan Station is going to be totally destroyed).<br /><br />At the end of the credits, Isaac manages to respond to Ellie's last broadcast, and it seems he has survived. However, they spent a long time building up the nature of his sacrifice, only to have him seemingly survive (and survive for sure, as shown in the DLC...and then he seems to die again). Silliness.<br /><br />Definitely bad: Ellie is reduced from a strong, confident survivalist to a weak damsel in distress whose rescue occupies much of the game. Her face has become more traditionally feminine, her breasts seem to have grown several cup sizes, she now wears a supremely low-cut shirt, and the climax of the game is a kiss scene with her and Isaac. In other words, she has been hypersexualized, and it is to the detriment of the game. I wish they would have kept her the way she was.<br /><br />And the end of the game itself seems really way too easy; it's even easier than DS2. You get to stand in the exact same place, and your position allows you to TK limbs off live Necromorphs. I beat it the first time, and it was anticlimactic.<br /><br />It's still the same old DS3, despite the changes, but some of the changes have not been good for the game.<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD: I've dropped my rating to three stars after realizing how absolutely lazy this game is. The graphics are great, but every optional mission looks EXACTLY the same. Every room looks the same...I think the turning point came when they re-used a briefly-seen monster from the first game. Are you serious?! It didn't bother me at first but it's part of why this game can get so boring.
59	-1	This game came with three codes, Sims 3, Sims Late night and Sims high end loft.  One of the codes was not valid....
60	1	As fas as expansions go, this one added a lot of fun careers to play around with. I am very happy with this purchase!
61	-1	Your software installer caused unwanted popup ad and I uninstalled ultimate mahjongg 20 . Your software installer caused me internet explorer loading problems as well. I was given a warning about your software installer, but was told by your rep that it would be ok to down load this installer and the Mahjongg 20 program. I also tried to get this program to work in various screen resolutions to get a full graphics screen. I would not recommend this program to any one for the multiple problems it caused me. My operating system is win 7 pro 64 bit and after a full restore it is now hopefully back to normal operation. As a prime member, I would appreciate a full refund for this failed program, Ultimate Mahjongg 20, which was an ultimate disaster to my OP System. order no. 104-7766943-8702615.<br />Sincerely,<br />Eugene F White<br />Prime Member<br />Follow Up:<br />I finally have my Operating system back to it's old efficient self again after many hours of recovery and updates. I repeat, do not buy this program or use this Amazon Software Downloader Program especially, if you get any warning messages during installation. If you bypass the warning messages that indicate the Amazon Software Downloader can cause your OP system problems, BELIEVE IT!!!! AMAZON, you need to correct this problem with your SOFTWARE Downloader Program and better scrutinize the software games more closely for bugs, malware and unwanted pop ups! And, to those who read this, also beware of any so called FREE SOFTWARE FOR GAMES! I pride myself in having intermediate or better computer knowledge, but even I get fooled from time to time!<br />Gene,<br />Prime Member
62	-1	Not worth the confusion go to a store
63	-1	Where the hell is m code.
64	0	kinda repetitious
65	0	This product is alright but has no functionality with my logitech pc controller. If it did I would be in my office all evening playing it. Using the keyboard is terrible. If a reviewer knows of anyway to bypass this issue I will upgrade my rating.
66	1	Great
67	0	My son like it.
68	-1	It doesn't work for windows 8
69	1	This is a great and convenient. I was able to purchase an input this code for my sons in minutes.
70	0	After I purcashed this item  it said I was supposed to get this, three free games, and $5 AIV Creds and I only got the membership
71	-1	my download will not work
72	-1	MASS2 THIS DOES NOT DOWNLOAD PROPERLY.  WHEN IT IS INSTALLED THE DOWNLOAD STICKS.  IT TOOK HOURS FOR IT TO DOWNLOAD SO NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS VERY DISCOURAGED.  IT SEEMS THAT DOWNLOADS MADE FOR THE OLDER COMPUTERS DON'T WORK.  THE DISKS ARE NECESSARY FOR WINDOWS 7 FOR INSTALLATION.
73	1	I anticipate a great game as usual from the team who created MW2.   MAD-FOX...... Let ME see you on the field. I'm waiting for you. MAN-2-MAN if you are brave enough.   I'll turn your tears into bloooooooood.  
74	-1	In my opinion a far cry from the usual Jewel Quest Games.  Awkward and cumbersome are words that come to mind.  Too easy! Terrible graphics.  Don't waste your money.
75	-1	Thought I would like the game, but it quit on me.  Can't finished the game,<br /> for there must be something wrong with it.
76	-1	The download is corrupted, save your money.
77	1	There when I need ya
78	0	Not sure what to say.  I know the game is probably great, but it wasn't compatible with my computer for one reason or another and I couldn't get it to work even with support from EA.  My advice is to buy a physical copy.  I couldn't get a refund for the digital purchase.
79	1	fun game!
80	1	"I decided to comment on the game (version 1.01) since I have been playing it for almost two months.  I downloaded it from the company website and had no trouble running it.  I did experience some of the problems described by a prior review involving the track construction/destruction and routing of trains.  After playing the game many times, I have found those problems are often a result of my lack of understanding of how to properly lay track and route trains.  The only \\""glitch\\"" I have encountered is that after creating an empire of dozens of trains, I will occasionally have a train that gets \\""stuck\\"" and must be scrapped.  I may have too many trains on a route and the stuck train has no opportunity to move given its level of priority.  I rather fault myself until I can prove its the program's fault.<br /><br />Anyway, I play the game on a 2011 iMac without any performance issues on the highest game settings.  On my 2008 MacBook Pro, the fans roar to keep the temp down on the machine.  I have put the settings down to the min, and that helps, but not eliminates, the need to cool the processor.  I love the graphics, and they are nicely detailed.  Again, no problems on the 2011 iMac.  On the MBP, late in the game with many trains, the graphics will slow down, occasionally.  I don't have a retina display, so I don't know how the graphics look on it.<br /><br />The game itself is a perfect time-killer.  It can be played easily without much reading of the manual, but as you get involved, you may want to refer to it if you increase the difficulty levels.  I like the different scenarios, but I have not tried the editor to create my own.  I have not used the multiplayer option, either.<br /><br />I wish the zoom feature would zoom out further.  Sometimes, I rather focus on world domination instead of seeing the trains themselves zipping around.  Also, new scenarios would be welcome in the future.  I could imagine a WWII scenario in Europe.  I saw that one scenario touches onit, but I would like more detail.  Protecting trains from attack from the air and ground, protect the rails from being blown up, rerouting traffic due to areas being lost/won or bridges blown-up, moving troops and equipment to the front, moving troops and civilians to safety, etc.  Yes, I digressed ....<br /><br />I must admit, I have been interested in trains most of my life.  I find this game to be the next best thing to having a real model railroad."
81	-1	In all fairness this is a decent game. Intriguing storyline and HOSs are not too hard, not too easy. But that's where any pros end.<br />This game is full of glitches. I was fortunate (I guess?) and played for about 3 hours before I had any trouble. I play these for the simple pleasure of being able to zone out and wind down after a stressful day. Unfortunately, the next hour undid any good, as I was more stressed than when I started.<br />After checking several game forums I discovered I was one of many, MANY who had issues with this game. Most of these have been ongoing since it hit the market. Any requests for resolution from the makers has been largely ignored. Their only advice was to creat a new profile and start from the beginning. Yeah, I want to waste another 3 hours. According to other players this DID NOT resolve any issues. I only wish I had researched before I bought. If I'm even tempted to purchase another Alawar game you can be assured I will check reviews from outside forums first.<br />Shame on Alawar for keeping this on the market with so many known issues, And shame on Amazon's Quality Control for silently endorsing such a product by continuing to sell it.
82	1	i was looking for ac4 and i found this i considered price when it's on sale i just bought this at 19.99$
83	0	Is a unique game but would recommend watching the watchdogs forums if you really want this game and wait until most of the issues have been fixed.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> Unique Gameplay<br /><br />Cons:<br /> Tends to be laggy for most even with a good video card<br /> Game feels like it is intended for console when you try using mouse and keyboard (plays ok with 360 controller)<br /> Arcadish feel when driving<br /> Multiplayer is lacking
84	0	Its fun.........but &#34;Call Of Duty with mechs&#34; is a very accurate description. Played it for about 2 weeks and maybe a handful of times since, I need to try it out again.
85	1	I love this game.  It was well worth the money I paid to download it so that I can play it anytime I want.  I highly recommend purchasing it!
86	1	Very entertaining game, lots of fun.
87	-1	"I really don't know why I don't enjoy this version as much as I do \\""Little Shop Of Treasures\\"" which I still play occasionally,but it just feels that it is never going to end,and in fact I have not finished it! I always end up getting bored and go play another game. I would recommend \\""Little Shop Of Treasures\\"" instead,if you don't have it, Abra Academy,or Mystery P.I: The Lottery Ticket,Mystery Legends: Sleepy Hollow, Big City Adventure:Sydney,Australia,or Mystery In London: On The Trail of Jack The Ripper."
88	0	I love the new Platypus II, only there are no cheats to help out when in trouble.  See if there is any to be found.  NEED THEM URGENTLY.<br /><br />WAITING ON PLATYPUS 3
89	0	The game is fine. I don't like the fact that the catalog says the game is .99. But that only gives you an hour playtime. Nothing is stated that it is a game trial and there would be another fee for the full game. This is the second time this has happened.
90	0	When I purchased this, I did so not knowing that this would be missing the free Plant/Zombies Pack that is offered through outher outlets. This product is not equal to all the others out there for this reason.<br /><br />Understand when buying this that it does not include the free add on everyone else seems to offer.
91	-1	Can i get a refund the game isn't playable at all.. i wish i looked into the reviews before buying..
92	-1	The controls are difficult to master on a pc
93	1	This is the first video game I have ever purchased and the free download had me hooked!!! The character is funny and fun.  The strategy makes you think.  Now I can't get past the baseball bat level..so if you buy it, e-mail me and tell me what strategy you used.  You'll love it for the fun of it!! TGranny
94	-1	It's astonishing to see so many positive reviews for this game.  I could only stand it for about 20 minutes before I quit.  Lousy controls, terrible graphics (especially on a big monitor), awful pathfinding (click somewhere and hope it doesn't take you somewhere you didn't expect (like right by a guard).  Pretty boring to boot.<br /><br />Who could possibly give this game FIVE stars?  I'm beginning to lose faith in Amazon's rating system.
95	-1	Battlefield is a great game, I've been playing Battlefield since Battlefield 2.<br /><br />I bought BF4 for the PS3, but it was limited to 24 players, so I bought it for the PC because I didn't wanted to wait for the PS4 (either way, I'm such a fan of BF that I always buy the pc and ps versions, but I usually wait a little for the price to drop before getting the PC version).<br /><br />I was pretty ansious to play BF4 on the PC with 64 players, but so far it has been a terrible experience, the game crashes at least once an hour, and the net bug due to other users with different ping is horrible, they kill you when you are on cover, there are a lot of times when both the other player and you kill each other when it shouldn't be like that, and the patches that they are releasing are not fixing anything. Servers with 64 players are unplayable.<br /><br />That's the reason I'm giving 2 stars, its a great game, but it was released on a beta status, the game was not ready to be released.
96	-1	I have tried to download and install this file, it installs but I cannot get it to play. I have uninstalled it and going to reinstall to see what happens.<br />It stated 4 days 4 hours download time !! This is ridiculous!!!<br />I cannot review on game, but download is not working once installed! [[ASIN:B0030GG186 Vegas Make it Big [Game Download]]]
97	0	Be prepared to wait upwards of 48 hours for this game to download.
98	1	NO tax yay
99	-1	meh. Cell-style animation is a plus but overall the game is hard to play and a lot of things dont make sense. More than once I was blasted off a ledge by a boss character and has to walk back around (the long way) to get back to the battle. Each time all of the enemies I just killed were back and would drain my health. And even though all of the enemies came back, none of the supplies regenerated. That is just one of the many frustratingly stupid things about this game.
100	1	How come they still make these stealthy games? Been looking for a true stealth experience unlike assassin's creed and here it<br />is, pick it up!
101	1	Awesome. I love this game. The best of this HD Edition is Multiplayer. Great offer!
102	1	I'm reviewing this game not for amazon but for the great service that spectromancer team did to help me out some people that have bought the game on amazon had steam keys problems. I have waited 6 months still no reply from amazon support instead they ask me to review a game that I don't have...just WOW... after that period of time I decided to go on the web page of spectroamncer ...very easy to find by the way... and sended a e-mail explaining my problem in about 1 week everything was perfect  awesome support! fro spectromancer  the email adresse is :  support@spectromancer.com<br /><br />verdict: amazon support for this title 0 stars  spectromancer team 5 stars<br />hope this will help you guys to buy this great game that people turn down on amazon cause for the lame support and do review not base on the game cheers!!!!!<br /><br />P.S: I wanted to say that beside that specific game I DID NOT had any sort off problems every with amazon and I'm not saying that amazon is crap, im pretty sure that there doing there best but sometimes thing can go wrong. but they could have told peoples to go ask spectromancer team for help instead of the wait.
103	1	Very in-depth strategy game. I can understand if there are negative reviews about is being slow, but I believe this is more realistic and it promotes use of methods other than warfare. You cannot survive by fighting with your neighbors, it will eventually wear down your nation. Only negative I can see is there is no option of &#34;mission&#34; or end game.
104	1	Both games are good, but one needs to buy all the DLCs seperately if you want a full experience of the games. The worst thing is LA Noire runs like crap on ATI hardware, and I don't see any official patch that helps the situation, too bad.
105	0	Needs more variety.
106	0	The Good: Captures the Cold War atmosphere, fun tactical combat, deep character customization<br /><br />The Bad: Every battle starts to feel the same, nothing in between to break it up, story is muddled, squad perma-death is frustrating<br /><br />XCOM: Enemy Unknown was one of the best RTS games to come out in years. It had tightly coordinated tactical gameplay that packed a punch and kept you on your toes. The Bureau kind of keeps this idea while bringing you into the dice rolled battles first hand so you can control them. The game takes place after the Cold War where agent William Carter is tasked with helping save the entire planet from an alien invasion. That is one hefty mission, but you have squad mates to bring alongside with you.<br /><br />XCOM is a third person cover based tactical shooter. It pretty much feels like a zoomed in more detailed Enemy Unknown. You will encounter some of the same enemies and the art style is even the same. You can snap into cove and order your squad to do things like lift and enemy up, heal, revive, throw out traps like mines, sharpshoot and enemy etc. You can queue these up while time slows down and watch it all unfold. It's a very powerful tool in this game and can get you out in a pinch. The shooting itself is mediocre. Weapons never feel all that powerful and somehow just feel off. Ammo runs out constantly and you can end up weaponless a lot of the times in a hot firefight. At least the level are well laid out enough for you to find adequate cover and plan your attack.<br /><br />There's really not much else to the game outside of shooting. You move from fight to fight pressing switches or finding intel. The game is a bit on the cinematic side and the opening sequence is pretty awesome. Once your back at HQ you can walk around and talk to people, start side missions, and upgrade your squad and loadout. You get the same death penalty as in Enemy Unknown. A completely leveled up squad member can be lost in battle if you don't revive them in time, however the revive time is way to quick to pass. It's not enough time for someone to go across a battleground and save someone. This becomes frustrating since leveling up takes so long. When you do choose squad members you can choose from Snipers, close combat, medics, and various other classes. This mainly just determines their skill tree.<br /><br />I also found it annoying that weapons are slow to unlock. 25% through the game I only found a few weapons and two alien weapons. There's various other blueprints or tech you can find to turn into other things, but it's not as deep as Enemy Unknown. What's here is solid fun, but it gets repetitive and boring quickly. Every battle turns out the same, you get the occasional boss fight but it just gets so monotonous where there would be more substance. The game looks pretty good on PC, but looks very dated on consoles. It's nothing special, but the attention to detail on the Cold War era atmosphere is pretty awesome and engaging.<br /><br />As it stands, The Bureau is a solid shooter that takes the tactical RTS gameplay and puts you in the driver's seat. The atmosphere is well captured and the skill tree system makes battles easier, but the frustration of perma-loss when a squad member dies is excruciating. The overall combat can get dull and repetitive early on with nothing in between.'t revive them in time, however the revive time is way to quick to pass.

107	0	I bought it to support Artix Entertainment to be honest. I don't really feel one way or the other about the armor.<br /><br />Sure it's nice I guess. For the price I wish there was more to it. I wish it included a back item, a weapon, and a helm.<br /><br />It is what it is.
108	1	I haven't purchased tis game but I think it is awesome that the ASIN is B008SNTITS. Worth getting the game just for that!
109	1	still miss the DOS version but this is almost as good
110	1	I used this card for the points.. and I play LORD OF ULTIMA.. THIS CARD IS GREAT VALUE ON ANY EA online game..
111	-1	I purchased this game, took over 7 hours to download, then once completely installed and loaded up it would display a screen saying that the game is unable to play due to unexplained error? Uninstalled, Re-downloaded, and re-installed 5 times, still not working.
112	1	"\\""Vogue Tales\\"" tells a very simple story about a girl working her way across Europe in order to find the thief who stole her birthday gift.<br /><br />This is a classic time management game set up. Serve the customers before they get angry and leave. Achieve the needed amount of points or dollars per round in order to move on to the next one.<br /><br />\\""Vogue Tales\\"" is very reminiscent of \\""Fashion Dash\\"" but is much more fun. It's set up more like \\""Cake Mania\\"" in that you can add embellishments to the outfits. The embellishments get more complex as the game goes on therefore upping the difficulty level.<br /><br />If you are a \\""Cake Mania\\"" lover, this is basically the same game only with dresses and coats as opposed to cakes. The difficulty level is turned down significantly from \\""Cake Mania\\"" but is still very entertaining.<br /><br />My only gripe is that there is no level change. In other words, I can't go back and play the game through again on \\""hard\\"" or \\""challenge\\"" mode. Once you're through the game, you're through.<br /><br />Would I pay $7 for this game? Probably not. Buy the disc \\""Play 2.\\"" It's on there. The \\""Play 2\\"" disc comes with 25 similar games and fluctuates in price (I think it's now $10, over the holidays it was $14). In any case paying about $10 for 25 games as opposed to $7 for this one game makes a lot more sense."
113	1	Awesome
114	1	I don't care how old you are you need to play this game. Best lego game out there and one of the best LOTR games
115	0	We loved the original Dragon Age for the great story. DA2 is much harder to get into. I find myself not really caring about any of the storylines or characters and most of the time don't really know why I am doing each thing.    That being said, it is still fun to play and the action is good.
116	-1	... whichever way you choose to look at it. The Gold Starter Pack was the same price but you get 2 cars and 8000 boost. This new pack is not worth the price at all. I used to buy these starter packs about once every month or two, but never again.
117	0	I liked the game, ok!! I seemed to complete, the game to quick, wish it had more levels, great for yonger children, ages 9-15!!
118	0	"Silden Software is getting pretty good at creating some very average budget shooters. In addition to \\""Chernobyl: Terrorist Attack\\"", they also did the recent \\""Alcatraz\\"" FPS, and \\""The Mark\\"" a few years ago. All of them decent enough, but bog-standard as far as gameplay.<br /><br />\\""Chernobyl: Terrorist Attack\\"" appears to use the same engine as their other games. I did a bit of research, and it seems that Silden has created their own FPS engine. Which is a great achievement, as it contains most of the modern graphical eye-candy. Be warned however, that this engine has always run a bit clunky no matter what machine I have it on. For the most part, it's smooth enough, but I do get occassional hitches whenever something is going on. Nothing terrible, but it doesn't run as smooth as other more popular engines.<br /><br />Graphics in this game are pretty good. They went a little nuts with the depth-of-field, but other than that, it's quite pretty. The settings are very good, and quite evocative. Nice sense of place. When I first got dropped into the game, I was impressed. Until I saw how badly they botched the linearity. I can handle linear games if need be, but not when the game handles it by: (1) Radiation signs. Go past them, and you'll soon die. (2) Non-signed areas, where, if you stray into them, you'll get an audio cue to turn back to your mission...or die. That's how they keep you on the straight-and-narrow in this game. It's not a game killer, but it's frustrating, as this game had some nice gameplay potential due to the huge areas.<br /><br />Enemy AI is okay for a budget shooter. Weapons are likewise okay. I had a fair amount of fun with this game, and this developer (Silden) is improving with each game they release. If you're looking for a Triple-A experience, look somewhere else. But if you are a fan of budget FPS games (as I am), then I can recommend it. A lot of work went into this game by a very small developer. Not everyone will be capable of seeing that (nor should they be), but if you think you can appreciate the effort, there is fun to be had here.<br /><br />Test machine: Dell Core i7 870, Windows 7 Premium, 8 GB ram, GTX460 1GB.<br />Average framerate with everything cranked up: 75 fps. Should have been much higher in my opinion, but this engine needs a bit more optimising.<br />Also, this version of the game (download version) does use Amazon's activation wrapper, but I had no issues with it.

119	0	Not as good as a hand job, but the next best thing...
120	-1	I spent nearly half an Hour trying to make it work , TONs of information but not easy to handle, I just wanted a ride in my &#34;POD&#34;, get in the action, but it wasn¬¥t easy to do. is not well designed for a roll video game, and you HAVE to pay monthly for using your game...it¬¥s the opposite to a good game.
121	1	"An interesting retread with a few nods to it's predecessor, this game provides some good \\""Holy s***!\\"" moments and as with its predecessor, has a living history feel to it.<br /><br />That being said, shooting was exactly the same as in Bioshock 2 and it felt a bit too easy on normal."
122	0	I guess this should be based on each individuals PC, but even with lag correction my PC had trouble accepting what notes I was playing. Often times it would say I hit no note, but even the in-game amp would sound off in the background. The tuner also was an issue, as it would give me a +0 (indicating it was correctly tuned) and then flip between +1 and -1 telling me quickly that I needed to both tighten and loosen my string. You mean.. it's in tune? I spent more time trying to get the game to accept my instrument as tuned as practicing it seemed.<br /><br />For reflection, I also purchased the Xbox 360 version on black Friday. That version operates phenomenally and these issues only seem to be on the Steam download version. Until a patch comes through, it's Xbox 360 only for me.
123	-1	I have no idea how to use this.  I get to a screen that says to use scope.  That is as far as I can get.  This is one I wish I hadn't bought.
124	0	I have yet to finish The Maw after starting it twice, and it's not because it's a bad game, but more so to do with the slow, plodding pacing the game provides.  This was the developer's first XBLA game and it shows a bit so many years down the road; playing the game feels very slow and VERY by the numbers (go here, collect, door opens, repeat).  The characters are REALLY cute & charming though and shows the beginnings of what was to come in 'Splosionman and Comic Jumper.<br />Cute, funny, but ultimately is a bit of a snooze to play.
125	-1	I got sonic adventure and it was a nightmare to control! Playing on a keyboard sucks and my controller made the cam spin out of control constantly<br />I hoped this was fixed with Sonic Adventure 2... but it wont recognize my controller at all!  And the keyboard lay out is idiotic!  I wanted to change them around by it wouldnt let me!  The default is downright stupid! I can't even start the game, navigating the menu is hard with this thing!  DON'T BUY.  I WANT A REFUND! I'm sure they wont give me one since its downloaded content and there is nothing i can return... but i really wish i didnt just WAIST 10 DOLLARS ON THIS UNPLAYABLE GAME!
126	-1	Ok, This is my first review ever on Amazon, I've bought over $100k worth of items on Amazon, I feel so strongly about this POS that I have to write something.<br /><br />This game is buggy, you can not play it for more than 5 minutes without it boosting you out with some kind of errors.<br /><br />I installed patch 2.1 correctly, still same issues<br /><br />Installed patch 2.1.1 still crashing!<br /><br />I don't mind the always on function, but I just paid $19.99 for a POS that I can't even play.  I've tested it on three different computers. THREE!!!!!!!!!!!  Same issues, crashes and buggy as hell.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!  There tech support is horrible, the forum is full of bugs reports and such but no updates to fix.<br /><br />They are scamming you out of your money, DO NO BUY!
127	1	If the rating scale was 1 to 10, I would give the MAC version of this excellent game a 9 for minor interface and graphic issues. It plays just fine, though, and actually loads and runs faster on my 13&#34; Macbook Air than it did on my Windows 7 x64 boat anchor.<br />Civ IV has been among my favorite games for years. Recently, the last Windows laptop I will ever own burped, rolled over, and floated to the top of its tank. I came to Amazon for a quick download of the MAC version of Something-- Anything: starving for strategy. If you don't know what I mean, pause for thought before buying this highly addictive turn-based strategy game.<br />Your civilization begins alone on a dark and unmapped earth-like planet. You found a city, send out scouts, discover other civilizations, pottery, music... and eventually gunpowder. Use your time and resources well, and your cities will thrive with culture, wealth, and productivity. And bristle with military might, because they must.<br />The game presents a too-simplistic historical narrative, but it's a game, after all. It is beautifully implemented and very finely balanced, and much more strategically complex than the resource-gathering mouse-click races you may be familiar with in real-time strategy games.<br />The MAC version does not display the mini-map consistently on my MacBook, and some of the keyboard shortcuts I was accustomed to use in Windows were hard to find at first, but MAC OS loads the game much more quickly, and plays very smoothly. You'll be happy with it, if you are prepared to flex a little.
128	1	no problem

130	0	The game is fun, it's a classic. I loved playing this back when it came out years ago, but it is definitely showing its age.<br />The controls are a little difficult to figure out and doesn't sen like I can customize to a way that fits my style, but can't complain too much because the game was free. Thanks again Amazon!
131	-1	The Amazon downloader will only work with Mac os 10.6 or higher but the game will not run on Maverick OS.
132	1	Okay it works!  The game is very good!  It is just tough at times. I like it a lot! I recommend it!

IF you don't believe me check out \\""Mass Effect 3 install Stuck\\"", or \\""Mass Effect 3 must be logged in as administrator to continue\\"" in google and you will see so many issues with installing this client and downloading games.

134	1	i thought this game would be for fun  well its a challenge for me as you progress more food impatient customers i have to meet the challenges so goes any idea of a relax game, it took a couple of tries but i got through to the end felt pretty proud  its fun there is a relax game, a challenge game  everyone can play but can you get to the end  good luck hope you enjoy it as much as i do yes replay is like playing the game for the first time
135	0	Is a great game, but you can reach the end of the game in two days. Good graphics and nice history line.
136	0	"I love Hidden Object and Puzzle games and I've bought 14 of those games from Amazon in the past 4 months. This one just wasn't all that great. I actually quit before I made it half-way through because it's pretty boring. Yes, it's unique in that the screen is cut into 16 segments where the hidden objects can be found, but that is also the draw-back. It becomes monotonous searching from screen to screen trying to find the last 2 items. The storyline is also weak, although it does give you interesting facts about the locations where you've been, but I would rather play a game instead of a history lesson. The \\""puzzles\\"" between levels are pretty much the same you find in most of these games, but they are too easy, and I've seen them all before. Overall, it couldn't keep my attention, and I usually get sucked into these games until I've finished within a day or two. This one I will save for a rainy day when I have absolutely nothing else to do."
137	0	Eastern European gaming companies have came up with some great ideas in the last 5 years (STALKER and THE WITCHER pop to mind, to name just a couple). Unfortunately, although it tries hard, YOU ARE EMPTY is NOT one of the best examples.<br /><br />This game's strengths are mainly the story and the settings. Soviet-era mentality had always been obsessed with mind-control sciences, and when something goes terribly wrong the world is turned into a zombie and cyber-entities cesspool.<br />The graphics are nice (comparable, at least, to those of HL2 - a 6-year old game mind you), the surfaces are not too shabby (notice that they have been done painstakingly in polygons, not bump mapping!) - and the game engine, although previously untested, hardly ever glitches! Now THAT is solid kung-fu programming!<br />The scenery, with all the Soviet propaganda posters and the beautifully done cut-scenes, is gorgeous; whereas, the sounds and music have been tastefully chosen, with radio loop-announcements cutting through the cold Russian wind making the power-lines whistle: this is a game that is really easy to get immersed into!<br />Interestingly, YOU ARE EMPTY runs for well over 16 hours(!): this is how long FPS games used to last - and not the miserly 3-4 hours the latest over-hyped releases do...<br /><br />On the down side, the weapons may be realistic yet could not be more generic and unimaginative; movement is slower than flowing syrup, something especially nerve-raking when enemies have the tendency to jump you from all directions; and the damage (both sustained and inflicted) is hardly balanced: it is preferable to get hit by a grenade than to jump a single floor, to absorb several bullets that get bitten by a single rat and to keep using your sidearm than a rifle, since they do about the same damage, appear to have the same range and the sidearm can hold more bullets...!<br /><br />This is a game that had been available since 2008 in Europe before finding distribution in the US - and, undoubtedly, this is not helping its chances to impress. We should count our blessings though: the European release also featured the infamous...StarFORCE.<br /><br />This is a solid first effort by DIGITAL SPRAY, a newly founded group, that although fails to stand out in this pre-Christmas crowd, lays stable groundwork for its future developments. Let's only hope they do not get outright absorbed into a gaming mega-corporation...<br /><br />All in all: a creative and atmospheric game that is worth a budget admission price.t helping its chances to impress.

138	0	It's not as organized as the first one, the words do not appear in alphabetical order.  Other than that it has more modern/common words.
139	-1	What can I really say? Well... I have played many, many mmos and I have to say this was probably one of the least enjoyable I have played. The idea isn't a bad one... but Trion Worlds really fails to execute the game, as no one aspect of the game is really anything you've never seen before. Not to mention the overwhelming amount of bugs, big and small. The story missions aren't terrible, but the dialogue leaves you desiring a lot. In some areas you can see what they copied from the companies other mmo, Rift. Some quests feel very linear as they are go to this spot and pick this up and you're done. I could go on and on... but I think I've made my point. Don't get my wrong, there are a few aspects of the game that are enjoyable but overall the only way I would recommend this game is if you could pick it up for about $20.
140	1	it is very fun game , I've like it
141	0	Works okay, but not the quality that came on my last computer.  You can't go back if it thinks you have no more options.
142	-1	I recommend buying the disc if you're looking to buy before November 16th 2012- Origin won't let you download until then. It's a bit frustrating.
143	0	"I only play this now on the \\""speed\\"" game setting, as after I learned how to play the unlimited time left the game without much challenge.  What I found to be least appealing was the constant repetition of certain words in the puzzles--after a while playing you can recognize the target words with just a letter or two as a clue because you have seen them so many times. However, if you do not want to work too hard and just pass some time while watching tv, it can be an okay, if not too challenging passtime."
144	-1	Once program loads it takes upwards of 5 min. to load game.  Slow, slow, slow.  Don't let Amazon rip you off too!
145	-1	liked the game did not like all the messages and ads from manufacturer.
146	1	"Coffee Rush is a fun game- a mix of a serve your customers what they want and a match 3 game. Customers come in to your shop and place an order. The order is broken down into \\""parts\\"", for example, 5 coffee beans, 3 milks, etc. To fill the order, you have to make matches of 3 or more by swapping pieces.  I have played several match 3 games and this is the only one I've played where you can't swap pieces diagonally. (If that comes at a later level, I don't know, but I'm on the 3rd coffee shop and so far I can still only swap horizontally and vertically.) Not being able to swap pieces diagonally makes for a much, much more difficult game.  Very often I find myself having to make any matches I can (even if I don't need the ingredient) just to clear spots on the board hoping that what I need will drop in or move around to where I can use it.    The point of the game is to earn a certain amount of money each day by serving your customers what they want as quickly as possible. You move from level to level as you reach each daily goal.    Each customer has different patience levels. You can purchase items to help improve the mood of your customers and there are pieces on the game board that you can click on that also do the same. Each customer also has a different level of tipping. Patience levels and tipping levels are displayed when the person type is first introduced, but I haven't been able to find that information afterwards. Game notes suggest you serve your highest tipping customers first and give them the additional items available for bigger tips so I wish there was a list I could reference to know which customers are better tippers.    In addition to being able to purchase items to improve customer satisfaction, you can purchase new items to sell in the store that are worth more money. Each item on the coffee menu has a different value. As the daily monetary goals go up, you want to have more expensive items on the menu. More expensive items also take more ingredients to make, which takes longer to fill and makes the game more and more challenging.    This game is easily addictive and it's easy to lose track of time while playing. There are a few things that could make the game better but overall it's a lot of fun to play."
147	1	Got Just what i wanted a Code for my ps3 for minecraft 10/10 would buy again
148	1	This game is really fun, has nice graphics, can play coop offline and online, and its really cheaps. Thanks god I bought it.
149	0	This game gives a lot of ways to finish missions. Stealth is great. All out shooting is good to. This game also have a great story line.
150	1	The game is amazing, the world, Graphics, combat system well everything, one of the best MMO's today. Also is free to play, no monthly fee require so is even more awesome. Great game, still hooked after 6 months of release.
151	-1	"In my short playtime, I witnessed enough hacking to make me think I was playing Combat Arms. The kill cams, snapping to heads, etc. It's just terrible. Whenever someone cries \\""HACKER,\\"" I usually laugh and tell them to get better. But this is much different. The PC version of MW3 is ridiculously easy to hack, and the aimbots and stats hacks are overflowing from the internet. This is unacceptable for a title of this weight to have so many issues with hackers. Take it from any PC player with more than 20 minutes ingame; this game is filled with hackers.<br /><br />In regards to the actual GAME, it's fine. Same 'ol COD fish. Could've actually just been an expansion pack for MW2, seriously. But no surprise there. Just get this on Xbox/PS3 instead, even if you're into PC FPS. XBL handles hackers much better with new titles. VAC has no idea what it's doing, and Infinity Ward apparently is clueless."
152	-1	did not think was was any good when you go to the real one.  .  .  .  /  /  /
153	1	Thanks. Great product.
154	-1	The DRM on this game is unacceptable.  It is terrible what EA does to great game developers.  I can't believe Maxis is being forced to make such crap.
155	1	Nice card
156	0	I love mahjong games and have several. This one is kind of boring. It would be okay if it was all I had, but I think I played it twice and abandoned it in favor of the others. It's just so-so.
157	0	I loved heroes V and its expansions, but heroes VI is not as stable, there is no map generator, and too much repetition.
158	-1	OK so its annoying!!! !!!!!!!!! It Force QUITS ON THE MAC DO NOT BUY!!!! ITS A RIP OFF! I called amazon they refunded it without a hassle. So they said try in 1-2 weeks.
159	0	It's not necessarily a bad value, but it would have been much better I believe if Gearbox made all the DLC in-house (we will see with the upcoming Tiny Tiny based DLC, as that is finally a Gearbox made addition). The farmed out work wasn't bad. I enjoyed Captain Scarlette enough, but I didn't care for Torgue's DLC much (though Torgue was acted quite well, even though it was stupid - stupid funny, but stupid). I couldn't bring myself to even get terribly far into the Hammerlock DLC, which if you are playing with any other character than a over-powered, legendary weapon suited mega-vault hunter (like my main Gunzerker), the game is difficult to the point of frustration. Too many enemies are bullet sponges, they hit too hard and you die WAY WAY too often. In True Vault Hunter Mode with a high level character, it's doable. But the loot isn't there, so there isn't much to entice you to play through it from that point of view. With the newly increased level cap (DLC, though included in this pass), you may be interested in playing some more with your main toon, but the whole experience was rather frustrating. The season pass is a good value, but really only if you want every piece of the story DLC and level cap increase. It doesn't include any characters released, or any other DLC that may come after the Tiny Tina DLC. I probably would have picked and chose what I wanted and been happier, but I got the pass for a good price at launch and if you can nab this on sale it's probably worth it. I've spent 200 hours in this game between single player and co-op (most of which was spent in the base game, though a decent chunk was also spent in these expansions), so I've gotten my monies worth from it. But the content included in this package is wildly variable in quality and fun.
160	1	good
161	-1	I have downloaded and played about 25 of these hidden object games.  There is almost nothing to this game at all.  The storyline is really lame and the objects are easy to find.  If you are new to HO games or are buying this for a younger kid, the game would be fine.  If you are a seasoned player, don't bother.
162	1	Turn based strategy game for the game enthusiast.  Not the best graphics, but good story line and overall design.  It is worth trying out if you are a strategy game fan.
163	-1	Not only do you have to deal with Origin, but the scroll speed on the games is absurd and I have been unable to find a work around.<br /><br />Wish I could get my money back - complete waste of time.
164	0	This game had high expectations of being a great game, but the PC version is frustrating to wait over 15 minutes to find a game online, then the graphics engine but improved compared to his older brother, is still well below current performance computer market.<br />Definitely a game to hang out and it's nothing out of this world.
165	-1	Terrible game. the learning curve and newbie difficulties are frustrating. Go play star citizen.
166	0	So I only played for the 30 month free trial and only made it to around level 16. From my time playing I thought the Game was fun and the only reason I picked it up was because my friend wanted someone to play it with. Overall it felt like everyother MMORPG I've played. Although I really liked being able to switch classes at any time and the game looked beautiful. Once I have the money I will most likely renew my subscription and play some more but I can't see my self getting to involved with it right now.
167	-1	"Just downloaded this game add-on, but won't install.  I have re-downloaded it a few times, but each time the installer goes through the initial steps and then flashes a \\""Installation Failed\\"" screen, but does not indicate why its failing - the log screen is visible for a brief moment and says 'preparing to extract ... something, but then disappears.  The screen following has a 'back' button, but its greyed out and can't be used.    The registration code doesn't seem to be the issue, if I change a letter, it does indicate incorrect code, if I enter it correctly, it accepts the code and starts the installation, only to fail right away.    Not sure if its the version causing issues - I had 1.04 for Dragon Age, while Awakening has a patch for 1.03, or if its just a corrupt file (I've re-downloaded 3 times now with exact same results)."
168	1	"First off, this game was very hyped. We've literally been expecting it for \\""forever\\"" (give or take a year), since we saw the first gameplay reveal what feels like so long ago, and boy did this game deliver... I mean I used the word \\""superb\\"" in my title... I'm not the kind of guy who says \\""superb\\"" at the drop of a hat.<br /><br />Graphics 9/10 - This really utilizes the Unreal engine, which fits the style of the game and the overall feel. There was nothing in this game graphically to detract from the visuals except for poor wall textures in some of the dimly lit areas (developers may have gotten a little lazy there), for the most part the graphics were able to compliment and deliver the stunning visuals. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the developers gave more visual options than most games do, allowing me to balance performance and graphics on a gaming rig that is starting to feel the pressures of age.<br /><br />Visuals 10/10 - As I touched on in graphics, the visuals of this game are stunning. Every environment is unique, and if you enjoyed those feelings you got playing the first Bioshock -- wonder, scale, fragility -- you feel all of that in this game and some. Artistically, this game is a masterpiece, I couldn't find anything to take away from this game. Originally, when I saw the first gameplay footage, I was very concerned with how Elizabeth looked but they came through redesigning her to make her much less like a caricature (in fact they worked with a cosplayer who looked similar to their original design to make the character more realistic). I cannot overstate just how important it was that they did this, the original character modelling would have really detracted from the immersion of the game.<br /><br />Sound 10/10 - The sound of this game will blow you away. Everything is amazing, I get chills hearing some of the renditions of old-timey religious songs. I'm not sure if they intended for this to happen but it actually really made me yearn for more of that kind of music. It's not all hymns though, don't worry, there is such a variety in this game you should be blown away. There will be a lot of times you won't be able to help grinning, if you recognize the music.<br /><br />Story 8/10 - The story was great, obviously very well-written and unpredictable throughout. The characters developed well and I was able to connect fairly well to them. In many ways it's structure was akin to the first Bioshock, and although it didn't (sorry to say) deliver on the same scale the first Bioshock did, it was great none-the-less. I don't quite agree with the people who think it's the best part of the game, it was really lacking in some areas. Without spoiling anything, I simply didn't feel like all the necessary loose-ends were tied. There are not multiple endings like I had assumed, which isn't a terrible thing, I'm not crazy about having multiple endings on a linear story, it would feel like a bit of a cop-out. It does however affect replay value.<br /><br />Gameplay 7/10 - More than anything, the beefs I had with Infinite were that they sold me on it being in the Bioshock universe but with a much more unique playing style. While this is true for the environment, it's not functionally very different from Bioshock. The system of powers was supposed to be quite different, but functionally it was the same (with the exception of the addition of traps). In fact the only noticeable differences in gameplay were the elements that were simply not there anymore. There are no big daddy's or little sisters (I'm not saying there needed to be, but there needs to be some sort of functional equivalent to that game mechanism). Also eliminated were hacking and photography, which to me was a bummer since I always found that to be a nice optional bonus to the game. There were not the level of power-ups/upgrades strewn about the maps to be found that there were in the first Bioshock. In fact, most of the upgrades to your powers were justmeant to be purchased. This was a huge step backwards from the first Bioshock. I didn't fully explore the Infinite environment, but I explored it quite a bit my first playthrough, and it wasn't as satisfying as fully exploring the Bioshock environment.<br /><br />Combat 8/10 - The combat, on the other hand, WAS better than that of Bioshock. They added a great new mechanic in the skylines that makes combat a lot more mobile, fast paced and open. They did change the way powers work by having them be left-right mouse instead of making you use one mouse button to switch between (similar to Skyrim). This was a definite upgrade. Unfortunately one thing to be mentioned is that there weren't as broad of uses for the individual powers like there were in the original, instead there were simply more powers. The oil spills and patches of water were all very small so localized they were inconvenient to use, unlike in the first Bioshock where I found myself frequently utilizing the old water/shock combo. It seems like the one thing they did do to make up for this was to build-in \\""traps\\"" that you can place with your powers for the enemy to run in to. This was a great mechanic. (a useful tip might be to change your keybindings so that you aim with the right-mouse and use powers with the middle-mouse... it worked better for me).<br /><br />Misc. n/a - I can't really give a score to the game based on the fact that it allows you to do simple things like change key-bindings... however it does deserve mentioning since, sadly enough, some games don't actually allow that these days. The original keyboard layout is very poorly configured, but it didn't take much to fix it and make it usable.<br /><br />Overall 8.5/10 - I really enjoyed this game, the music was probably the most outstanding part of it, giving me chills at several points. The environment captures that underlying darkness of the first Bioshock but in a much more subtle way; with how bright and open this game is, it really doesn't have the intensely dark feeling of the first, and that's not a bad thing, it really worked for this game and fit the mood perfectly. The environment and tone were the biggest things setting this game apart from the first Bioshock, and definitely worth mentioning and applauding the developers for. Not having a save system was a real drag, especially for a casual play-through. I'm fairly anal-retentive about unnecessary killing, so at a few points I found myself having to restart a chapter because I upset the locals. They should have simply disabled saves for the hard-mode/1999 and allowed them for the medium/easy. The story added to the game, but it didn't deliver like the first Bioshock, but it would be asking a lot to ask for it to deliver on that level, the first Bioshock might have been the greatest video-game story of any I've ever played.<br /><br />This game stands on it's own, although I think it will always be the little-sister (no pun intended) of the first game, I should clarify that I'm putting it to a very high standard by comparing it to the first Bioshock, I would still say it is one of the best single-player storylines out there."
169	-1	"The code that this produced doesn't work.  I immediately entered the code into my playstation network account and it says, \\""The Prepaid Card code you entered is incorrect or is no longer valid\\"".

170	1	I was looking for a cheaper 12 month Xbox LIVE code than 59.99, and I was looking for a reputable website to buy it from. Amazon delivered very well again, and about 10 seconds after I purchased it, i had it redeemed. I was very happy to be able to find it for cheaper than usual, not some random website where it claims you can buy a year for 10 bucks. 5 stars!
171	-1	It did not work for me; I could not install it.
172	-1	The game would not work with my video card.
173	-1	If you have Windows 8, don't bother with this game - I have wasted over 3 hours of my time trying to get it to work at a resolution above 640x480 with no luck, even in XP Compatibility Mode.<br /><br />If you actually have a system that will run it, this is one of my favorite games ever, but now I've wasted my money here on Amazon.
174	1	A bit too short but actual gameplay, combat, abs a story that involves you just enough to keep you interested makes this shine SUPERIOR to the ambiguity of games like the over-hyped Destiny.
175	-1	was $40 for digital code now 60
176	-1	I bought this four days ago but it took about two days of the download on hooked up to the Ethernet cord for it to download, three hours for it to install (Not that bad) but with side tracks saying that I &#34;Need to contact my software vendor&#34;. But I finally got it on to Uplay and started it very excitedly it loaded to the screen where it connects to the internet then I pressed the new game button then the adventure. It loaded for about 30 seconds then stayed it &#34;Unexpectedly shut down&#34; so I kept on trying and the same thing. I finally uninstalled it thinking it installed wrong did it again (But it took less time) and the same results. I am trying it one more time as I am typing this. Very disappointed at Uplay and Amazon, now however I'm not going to tell you not to buy it because if you read the other reviews it works fine but buy at your own risk.
177	1	I really enjoyed this puzzle game, you may set the difficulty and the graphics and music is really cute.  Hours of fun for me and my family.
178	-1	I played the game at a friend's place on his PS3. Pretty fun and reminded me of the good times I had with You Don't Know Jack a long time ago. When I saw it was on sale for $3 for PC, I figured how could I go wrong? If the game works for you, then on the basis of game play, even though it's only 2 player, I'd recommend it. And on that basis alone, it's not 1 star review. If you go to the Steam forums, you'll see a ton of people who have problems even getting past the title screen. For them, adjusting their audio sampling rate apparently fixed the problem. For me, I was able to play the game (one time even all the way through!) but it would freeze in a random part of the game. Freeze, but still let me quit the game through the escape menu.<br /><br />There is no mouse (or apparently controller) support. From my understanding, THQ, the game's publisher, is going on under/getting bought out. And given Jellyvision's comments regarding their PC support, and my own experience with this PC port, I'd say you're rolling the dice when you buy this game.
179	0	Stays 'compact' on the screen -- can't enlarge or expand the displayed cards.  The barest bit of the tops of the undercards are shown -- OK if face down; eye-straining when they are dealt face-up and uoy need to see what is in the layout.  The Microsoft card games are much better.
180	1	Ok Everihing right
181	1	Great service. Very fast!
182	0	The games are old and it's almost impossible to find anyone online to play against, so if your buying this for that sort of connection, save your money. Playing with family is good though.
183	0	I thought it would be a little more challenging and have more worlds. I thought Mahjong dark offered more I will be looking for that one.
184	0	The first Amazing Spider-Man game wasn't half bad. It had funny lines, great combat which felt like the Batman Arkham games and a good variety of missions. Unfortunately, I thought this second game would be just as good and found myself disappointed. Spider-Man acts like a spaz in cutscenes, constantly moving around and waving his arms in a most un-Spider-Man like way. The dialogue is laughably bad and the camera is awkward and terribly glitchy. Also, missions are full of random insta-fail moments that will come out of nowhere for seemingly no apparent reason.<br /><br />Even for a huge Spider-Man fan like me, this game was a massive let-down. The ONLY redeeming quality is the webswinging--which is absolutely a blast to experience. If you enjoyed the first movie game...wait for a sale.
185	0	I want to return it but it won't let me and I didn't open the code................... But other than that it is pretty good
186	-1	So Disappointing!  It should be called Sims 2.5, because it is lacking SO much.  The create a Sim and build mode have improved, but that's the only thing nice I have to say about it.  There's a reason the previews focus so much on these...because that's all the game has going for it.  There's no world view, and there are only about 4 public venues.  Your Sim doesn't have free reign to walk next door, or ride a bike to the movies, you just hit travel on their phone, and poof there at their destination.  I just want to say what were they thinking, when they released this game like this!  Seriously!!
187	1	just purchased this item, check process takes about 1 min.<br /><br />worked like magic.<br /><br />i ordered a 50$ also just after this one with no luck so far ,<br /><br />will see what happens with that one , then post and rate the service.<br /><br />UPDATE : NOV don't remember exactly<br /> i got my 50$ code after a 2 hours delay,and i was so close to canceling the order but that would take 12 hours to confirm and the psn code takes up to 4 hours to be sent.<br />so i kept my order and after 2 hours i got an email with the code , and guess what? it worked .<br /><br />my initial rating was 5 stars for the 20$ card , and since amazon wont let me put 2 reviews(one for each card)and my rating for the 50$ purchase is 3 stars , then the average would be 4 stars.<br />i recommend you to stick with the 20's since it seems to be a lot faster and that is exactly what i'm doing on my next purchase'S .<br /><br />UPDATE : DEC 5th<br /> i just bought another 50$ code , and it took less than 1 minute to complete the purchase and get the code.<br /><br />from where am looking it looks like amazon will give you one card at a time and if you try to buy an other one a message will appear on the screen saying it would take some time for security purposes.the good news is you are still getting your code , the bad news is it will take some time ( 2 hours for me ) .<br /><br />i have updated the rating for the service to 5 stars.
188	0	It's an okay game. But it seems that it's too easy to win. I'm not very good at poker, but I usually win each tourney. All I have to do is go all in and the other players usually fold.
189	-1	not even worth the 5 bucks i spent on it.  really regret buying it.  regret playing through all of it even more
190	0	Your a guy trying to find a cure for some kind of disease I think. You can choose your class and try to make it thru all 30floors. I think the furthest I got was floor 15. You start with a pistol and a knife and explore rooms. Find objects and make something with them. The issue I had was that to make anything takes 4 to 5 items and the game has a ton of  items so your constantly having to sort thru everything. Also just for fun you need to eat food to stay alive and your pistol and knife and anything else you have has a health bar on it. (just an aside how in the world does a knife break? What? Dull maybe but break come on)<br /><br />So you need to find stations to repair your gear. The graphics while not super ugly are not bad. The issue is bullets or lack of and guns. There are many different pistols in the game so bullets labeled pistols may or may not work in your pistol. Fun. They also have a beam weapon you can never reload unless you wear a energy backpack. Fun again. Bad guys are numerous and mostly what happens is you run out of ammo and have to rely upon your knife. Fun. However its not all bad I did play  almost 5.5hours out of the game before I became bored with it. I got this for under 2bucks. For the price its listed at now its way to high. There are a ton of better games for the retail price of this game that are a lot better in graphics and gameplay. The tutorial hints at having people in the game help you out but I never encountered anyone helping me. 5/10 for me.
191	0	I've had a couple of the different Cake Mania titles and enjoyed them all. I find that the game tends to get really tough quick. However, with Main Street, it seems to stay on the easy side longer. It's a good game, but there are a few others I'm enjoying a lot more right now; such as Burger Bustle, Sally's Salon and Jessica's Cupcakes.<br /><br />If you're looking for a truly great time management title, go with Supermarket Mania 2.
192	-1	I have been getting the run around from Xbox on this card. I redeemed the $10 but was unable to use it towards a $9.99 1-month subscription to xbox live gold. Microsoft gave some excuse about it being just for games and DLC not a live membership- even though the description tells you how to redeem it for an xbox live gold membership. I'll see if Amazon will refund this, but am doubtful becuase I have already &#34;used&#34; it and cannot get it back.
193	-1	I really didn't care for this game at all - for all the hype, it's not worth the time it took to download.
194	1	Awesome game, can't wait til 4
195	0	The game is pretty darn good but there is a huge problem with it, the game does not work with SLI at all!!  I get a red blinking screen when I run my computer that was built to showcase games like Crysis 2 with stunning detail. It is very frustrating when you build a custom computer to be used with GAMES like Crysis 2 and the software company doesn't make the game so it works with them.  There is no support from the game company on the issue and I'm certain that there will not be a fix for the issue because they are releasing Crysis 3 very soon.  I will not be purchasing the third installment because of this issue and I would have never purchased this game if I would have known that I would waste countless hours searching for a fix that does not exist.  Thank you so much Crytek!!
196	1	Best price, best timing. Recommend.
197	0	"In an internal memo today, Maxis' general manager Lucy Bradshaw stated, \\""I'd like to say that it's not fair -- that the game score shouldn't be punished for a server problem.  But it is fair.\\""  So with that, I present an attempt to provide a fair review of this game in its current state.  A lot of the reviews here are mostly rages against EA and their insistence upon forcing \\""draconian\\"" DRM policies upon their customers.  DRM is the least of the problems with this game.<br /><br />It's definitely not all bad.  The game itself is beautiful, and serene.  The aesthetics are a huge step away from previous releases and in the right direction.  Some may complain that it is too \\""cartoon-ish\\"" but I was a big fan of the solid colors of the game.  I found myself just staring and appreciating random buildings.  The game looks very clean and polished.  I want to live in this city.  Lens effects and filters help you create a perfect look for your city.  A city with a lot of heavy industry looks great with the vintage filter, and the black and red filter would accentuate a crime-ridden casino town.<br /><br />As with most SC releases, the music is gorgeous and creates an atmosphere that sucks you in.  It is not at all annoying, harsh, or blaring.  When you go to different data views, building menus, or just pause the game, the music transitions seamlessly to a \\""lite\\"" version.  When I did notice the music, I loved it.<br /><br />Building upgrades and improvements are a big part of the gameplay, and necessary for your city to succeed.  Almost every ploppable building has an upgrade, from adding signs and flagpoles, to entire wings of a petroleum or mining headquarters.  You find yourself having to really think about what you want your city to specialize in, and you have to plan accordingly.  If you want to have a highly educated city, you better remember to  allow yourself plenty of room for university dormitories and schools.<br /><br />Which brings us to strategy.  With the smalltile size, you have to meticulously plan.  Wind direction, resources, and location within the region all come into play.  A tile heavy with coal could possibly be a great industrial and power district, but you have to account for where it stands in relation to its neighbors within the region.  If it's upwind, all that air pollution will spill over into the next town.  If there's a huge water table, you may want to consider not polluting it, and instead using it to provide water to neighboring cities.  Resources are finite, and solely devoting a city to the exploitation of any resource will go bad for you when it's all dried up.  The game is very challenging, and can present unforeseen circumstances to your every move.<br /><br />Traffic is a huge problem that I ran into.  Fully upgraded avenues with plenty of mass transit would still clog up, and cause havoc all over the city.  Power plants will shut down because the trucks delivering resources would be unable to push through the traffic.  The effect on emergency services is the worst.  Sims are hardheaded and do not move out of the way for firetrucks, so your city will burn to the ground while the firefighters are stuck in traffic.  This is a problem with the simulation, and needs to be remedied.  Again, with the small tile size, it's very hard to get around that once your city gets to a certain size.  Bottlenecks at the entrance to your city is an all too common occurrence.  And you only have one entrance.<br /><br />Now for the really bad.  The game's simulation relies heavily upon the client-server relationship.  When those servers are flaking out, the game flakes out.  This isn't simply a multiplayer issue, but a problem at the core level of the game.  Resources, money, workers, and utilities don't get transferred between cities, utility upgrades have a slow effect within the city, and upgrades aren't shared in the region.  Those are the least troublesome issues.  Actually being able to play is the larger issue.  When I could get onto a server, my regions would disappear and reappear at random and loading another city would seize up the game.<br /><br />The small tile size is another problem, but I won't spend too much time on it.  Maxis has stated that future patches (hopefully not DLC) will fix that.  As it stands right now, the tile size forces you to play as a region.  That's all well and good in practice, and something I actually appreciate and love.  However if the servers are flaking out, you can not play as a region.  All of the interaction between regions is handled by the servers, so it becomes an exercise in futility and you're stuck in your single, helpless, miserable, and rapidly failing little city.<br /><br />This is, of course, assuming you can get into the game at all.  A problem that I'm sure will soon be remedied, so I won't drill them on that.  I have faith they will fix the current server issues.  With that said, this isn't a launch day (week) problem.  It is a problem with the core functionality of the game.  Your regions are not synced between servers.  All your hard work would come to a dead stop if the server upon which it is built is unavailable.  Logging on to a new server will have you start from scratch.  How in the world, in a game built primarily around progression and creation, are we to create and progress under those circumstances?  All my hard work would be at the mercy of a single server.  As beautiful and challenging as the game is, this is a deal breaker.  Bear in mind, this is all from a single-player perspective.  I have no idea of the quagmire that is multiplayer.<br /><br />I have devoted a lot of time and faith to this franchise.  I've purchased every release of SC since it's inception, and I've spent countless hours enjoying it immensely.  I would consider myself a part of its faithful fanbase; one which continues to build, mod, and enjoy SC4 10 years after its release.  I feel as though Maxis has turned their backs on us.  I know they put a lot of love and hard work into this release, and the aesthetics and depth of simulation are to show for that.  However, aesthetics and depth of simulation are for naught if we can't play the game as its forebears intended.  The soul of this franchise is creation.  In this release, creation is dependent upon the health of a single server.  This isn't conducive to the needs of SC's loyal and patient fanbase.  We won't be willing or able to play this game 10 years down the road, and there won't be a huge modding community built around it.  It saddens me to walk away from it.  I requested and was granted a full refund.  If they allow us to play the single player game offline, where we can use mods, and for Pete's sake, simply save our hard work on our own hardware, then maybe they can have my money back.<br /><br />UPDATE 2014-05-14:  I've since repurchased the game (on sale) after Maxis patched it to allow offline single player mode.  This was back in March.  Other than that, I don't have much to add because I really haven't played it that much.  Which I guess sort of says something within itself.  It is far less frustrating when you're not depending on servers.  Traffic problems seem to be better.  That said, I still see myself getting bored, because of the low tile size.  I find I'm constantly switching back and forth between cities to deal with resource issues.  That gets dull rather quickly.  I'm hoping for bigger tiles in a future patch, or that EA will open the thing up for modding.  +1 star for offline."
198	0	Good game, but i prefer arcade. If her price is low buy it, if not, no....
199	0	Don't download it from Amazon tool 54 hours with a brand new hardrive and memory card to download took another 13 hours to install never had that problem from another site before and I checked to see if it was internet it wasn't
200	0	I'd be irritated if I paid &#62;$20. But I got it on sale &#60;$10, and at the price I find this an okay game with a nice visual look and setting that needs to be used more in games (possibly even exploring themes and issues from the 60s era, although this game does work them in somewhat, like Red Scare, McCarthyism, aliens among us, and exploration of &#34;alternate&#34; identities). This game doesn't go that far into those themes and issues though; it's more like a slightly smart/political spy thriller movie in this regard--more about the action, but enough attention to the issues that at least it can't be accused of being blind to them completely. As for the gameplay, fairly repetitive, and at times frustrating b/c of AI and UI. Mass Effect does the squad-action shooter-rpgish gameplay better. And, well, I swear, years-old Republic Commando did squad AI much better (could just be nostalgia filter).<br /><br />I'm not even accounting for the XCOM-tie-in, or the letdown after the early hype--I can understand why people would be pissed, but I found it decent enough in an alternate-fictional-history sense. But I'm not counting that in the stars-score above. This game stands on its own feet/merits, but there's not too much game there, or replayability.
201	0	I guess some people might be thrilled with it but my it did not get my son's attention and he is 7. I guess different strokes for different folks.
202	0	If you liked any of the Splinter Cells, you will like this game. If you like action games, you will probably like this game.<br /><br />[Good]<br /><br />Level Design: Much better than the old Splinter Cells. There's a lot more choice as to how you want to complete the missions. You can either take everyone on, avoid everyone, or take them out when they're not looking. In fire fights there's good emphasis on flanking. Even the final boss fight was really awesome. It just looks great and plays great.<br /><br />Replayabilty: Since you have a lot of choices for completing the mission, the game has challenges for specific play styles as well as different sets of weapons and gadgets. The changes in difficulty and the semi-randomness of how enemies are placed and how they behave is nice as well.<br /><br />Multiplayer: Co-op missions are awesome assuming you can find someone to join you.<br /><br />Story: This is the best Splinter Cell story so far.<br /><br />Weaker: Even with good armor, Sam can't take too many shots. This is good.<br /><br />Performance: I only have a mid-range PC with a mid-range video card, but even with all the settings maxed out, the game still ran pretty smoothly.<br /><br />[Bad]<br /><br />Uplay: I really don't see any value with this. It's just another separate login that doesn't really offer anything, aside from locking up parts of my game. This should be removed. Ubisoft, I'm never going to buy games from either your online store or EA's Origins store. Give it up. All Uplay does is add more problems like your old always on DRM. Please remove Uplay from Steam.<br /><br />Bugs: A lot of people are reporting bugs i.e. Game won't start or multiplayer doesn't work. My guess is the source of these bugs is Uplay. It needs to be removed.<br /><br />Steam Family Share: Because of the extra DRM from Uplay, this game doesn't support Steam's Family Share feature.<br /><br />Multiplayer: Maybe this will change with time, but there's no one online for PC.Probably because of Uplay. See a pattern? This is no different from past PC Splinter Cell games. I like single player better anyways so I can quit playing anytime. For other people this may be a huge problem since two of the major game modes are multiplayer only.<br /><br />Story: Like all Splinter Cell games, the story isn't very good. This time however, it's not as ridiculous and horrible as the older Splinter Cells. It's just super vague about everything. There is still some really unrealistic and ridiculous stuff in the game, but you don't play Splinter Cell games for the story.  On the bright side, the story is better and makes more sense than anything from Metal Gear. Hint: to make the story better, Sam Fisher and his organization can't be the good guys all the time. Those stories are for children and yet this game is for adults. A lot of adults enjoyed the Sopranos and Breaking Bad. Why can't this type of maturity in storylines cross over to video games? One more thing. In the field during an operation, professionals use call signs instead of their real names. This franchise sorely needs a story reboot with either better script writers and advisors and / or less constraints given by Ubisoft execs for the story. Maybe Ubisoft should hire a former spook to consult?<br /><br />Choice: The game does give players some choices, but I don't feel that they actually affected anything. It would have been nice if they actually changed the game or even the ending. Alpha Protocol wasn't a good game, but it had some good ideas. Future Splinter Cells should borrow from it.<br /><br />FPS view: I didn't like the small solo missions with FPS view. Splinter Cell to me is meant to be played in 3rd person view.<br /><br />[Misc]<br /><br />Not a full reboot: When you do something drastic as changing Sam's voice to someone younger sounding, you really need to change the story. A 30 year old with a college aged daughter doesnt make too much sense. The new voice actor is fine, butI still miss the old voice. This is a minor complaint since the storyline still sucks.<br /><br />I am really thankful that Ubisoft removed their always on DRM. Still Uplay is crap. Please remove it.<br /><br />If you don't like Steam, you probably won't like this download.
203	-1	Downloads and installs on Windows 7 but then crashes every time an attempt is made to play the game or change the configuration settings. Obvously not intended for a Windows 7 system or whoever wrote the install program needs to find another job. Don't waste your money.
204	-1	I have a few other expansions that work perfectly, but when I installed this one the game refuses to load any more. I tried uninstalling it and then reinstalling but I get the same results, only now that I've uninstalled it everything I had done on there is gone. Now I have to re-reinstall my games that work and cry foul that I wasted my $50 that I spent on this worthless download.
205	1	Worked and did what it should do. Quick delivery, like 10 minutes.
206	0	Pretty much Burnout reskinned, nothing really changes enough between the NFS games, felt a step backward with stupid unlock system and lack of variety in the customisations you normally get. Criteron seriously need to be taken off the project because they don't seem to be able to make a different game.
207	1	Simple and easy with instant access to the gold code. Amazon could not make it more convenient.
208	-1	when it was about 50% done with the download it said there was an error and i got disconnected and it STOPPED downloading.
209	-1	Gameplay is great.  Very reminiscent of Soulreaver and the rest of the LoK series.  Combat is fast, challenging, and interesting.    The problems come in with the fact that this is one of the shoddiest console to PC ports I've ever played.  Having to restart boss battles due to glitching out through the floor while attacking, losing hours of progress to a game bug that prevents a door from opening, random crashes, a complete absence of video options to optimize performance...    In short, buy it for the console.
210	-1	"I read the reviews and figured why not. It's only 5 bucks.<br />It downloaded rather quickly and installed with little or no issues. The graphics are \\""iffy\\"" at best, but that may be because there may be an update I haven't found yet.<br />The game itself is ok. It reminds me of Sid Meier's \\""Pirates\\"". Wasn't real fond of that game either.<br />I've played it a total of 5-6 hours and found it to be rather difficult to figure out some of the scenarios.<br />It's ok..but wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
211	1	Excellent in every way.
212	-1	I hate it only because I lack the ability to make it work. I actually gave up.....
213	0	it doesnt make sense to me,i mean i gave 3 stars because its a cool dirt bike racing game...but i cant play a game i bought and paid money for because i activated it 3 times? maybe its only a rental,hahahaha!!
214	-1	The game wouldn't work for me, and they refused a refund... Only buy this product if you're 100% certain it'll work, and even then hesitate; even EA customer support couldn't figure out what to do..
215	0	The game is good, is a blend of action and terror in fps, Resident Evil style, and you still play online in coop with friends.
216	0	Is this an expansion as labeled, or a sequel????    I want to get this game but not if I have to own a game to add this on to first. What is the first in the series, and is this an expansion or a standalone game?
217	-1	I bought the game on 5/16/12, including the Generations expansion and I am still unable to play it at all. I should of read comments here first before buying this game and wasting my money. I need my refund because this is too much hassle for me, given all the bugs and technical difficulties with it...(sighs). Not going to buy any digital game on Amazon..EVER!
218	-1	This was listed as working with windows 7.  Because of this, I thought it was an updated version.  Had I known it was the original version with the original graphics, I wouldn't have bought it.
219	-1	I did the trial on another site and really liked this game. Even after reading the reviews here on Amazon, I took a chance and bought the download. Big mistake! I ran into the graveyard bug and have tried everything to get around it. On other sites  several other people encountered it too. Worse, it seems the company initially promised they were going to fix the bug a while back, but never did. Now, apparently, they are not responding to anyone. Please, Amazon, stop selling this game! The game maker clearly knows it is selling a defective product. I have never had this problem with anything I've downloaded from Amazon before, and I am sure it's not Amazon's policy to continue dealings with a disreputable seller.
220	1	So I got crysis 2 on easter sunday on sale for $7 for pc, already owning it on ps3 i knew what i was getting into. basically I bought it to see how good it looked on my pc, and I was not disappointed. the servers are pretty lackluster now but they are still available, and hacking exists as this game came out before origin existed and punkbuster was not around prior. all in all, if you want a game for benchmarking look no further.
221	1	Nazi Zombies, Nuff Said.
222	0	Fewer levels than most Super Granny games.  I tired of white playing fields, but the puzzles were okay.  I much prefer the other Granny games.
223	0	it was o\k
224	0	I had it and changed computers and needed an updated version.  Not overly excited about it.
225	1	Wow This was an incredible purchase it is the exact game you think it is not a knock off and I played this all weekend long after purchase and found I have gotten very bad at this game after years of not playing ha
226	1	no comments
227	0	Works only for US accounts but are sold for people with accounts from all over the world....<br />I Cant use it with the account that i already own
228	-1	Gameplay is fine, but the waiting 3-5 mins just to even join a game is infuriating.
229	-1	Lost out on $10. Wouldn't play on my laptop and called customer service for help. But still didn't work. I know its not the laptop because RCT3 played extremely fine with no problems running Windows 8. Definitely encourge to ppl to download RCT3 instead of RCT2
230	-1	You can't use cheat codes on the pc version, don't buy it if you were going to use it.
231	-1	I received my  mos of xbox live but never got the game that came with this packge, even though i paid extra to get the game. very dissapointing.
232	1	Good game. Highly addictive though
233	-1	Game did not work properly.
234	-1	It downloaded to my laptop just fine. It's not interactive at all, the characters mouths don't even move when they're speaking. There are only Three (3) short games on it and they are LAME! WIsh I'd known more prior to my purchase!
235	-1	I have 150+ hours in Black Ops 2 but I cannot get Black Ops to run smoothly no matter what I try.<br /> I've spent hours in google, on BO and other games forums and tweaked every setting possible and nothing seems to work. As it turns out, I'm not the only one. Many PC users with newer and older computers cannot run this game smoothly. If you're one of the lucky few it might work for you, but just avoid it and don't bother wasting your money.<br /><br />0/5 - DO NOT BUY!
236	0	Great Game on XBox 360...<br /><br />Cannot get it to work on Win 8.1<br /><br />I have tried several things including modding the exe, still cannot get the game to function.<br /><br />No way to play it...
237	1	My 5 year old granddaughter is addicted..  it has been a great game for me to enjoy myself and with the grandchildren...  we love the explosions and the puzzles...
238	-1	Amazon ripped me of becouse te game does not work and hangs at the beginning really done work the game
239	1	THIS GAME REMINDS ME OF THE FOOL..ODDLY ENOUGH AND ROYAL TROUBLE BUT ITS EVEN BETTER ..SUCH A WONDERFUL GAME TRY IT..
240	1	I bought this because I wanted to be able to go and play on Club Penguin as a member anytime throughout the year, even if I don't play on the game very often.<br /><br />I really recommend it because it opens up a lot of different areas of the game such as you can buy more clothes, puffles, and do different quests once you become a member.<br /><br />Also it comes the card comes with a little tablet for your penguin which is pretty neat. You can't actually play on it like you can the Spy phone though, it's just a decoration for your penguin like another piece of clothing.
241	1	I received my code instantly! I used it right away! Thanks!!!!
242	0	The game is Ok , but  it remain buggy. A lot of Fun, but unfinished product. This game relie too much on dlc buisness
243	-1	I couldn't download it.
244	-1	I wanted to start a gunner toon immediately but discovered that I need a max level toon first... dissapointed. I play once a week so for me this expansion is worthless.
245	1	Dope
246	-1	This is the THIRD code I've purchased that doesn't work. No, I don't want to hear any excuses this time. First time, I looked over it, second time I got upset and this time...it's ridiculous.
247	-1	I just wasted twenty dollars on a game that won't work no matter how many hours I fiddle with it. Absolutely ridiculous. I would advise not wasting your time.
248	0	The game was alright, but it was way too easy.  I let my 7 year old grandson play and it was just his speed.
249	-1	This review is for &#34;Origin&#34; the website provider for the game.  I have tried to download this 3 times, all &#34;sessions timed out&#34;.  Also, beware when purchasing via Origin, as their auto-policy it so share your info with a gazillion different parties.  I wish I had gone with a different vendor.
250	0	its an ok fantasy adventure game and for 10 bucks well worth it for game and expansion. BE WARNED, it is almost 20 gb download and DOES NOT activate on steam or origin and the process of just installing the game was a real pain for me fyi, my comp is fairly new custom made windows 7. If i had bought this thing near or at full price i would of just asked for a refund.<br /><br />K so after downloading the 20 gb file, i noticed they split the languages into different FULL GAMES, 2 gb files each. Thats 2 gb for 7 or so dif languages, dont games usually have a more compact way of doing that? Anyways, after the fairly big sized download installing was kinda a bitch. First after downloading and trying to install, it said an error occurred involving the expansions pack not being copied over. I then deleted the file that the download was being installed to and tried again by installing directly in the same file. that way worked. sort of.<br /><br />HERE IS HOW TO DOWNLOAD IT (worked for me atleast):<br />-start download from amazon, Remember where you choose to download it b/c u need to find it later!<br />-go to the file called something like two worlds 2 game of the year pirates of the flying fortress edition, i DID NOT click the install that the amazon downloader said to do b/c i think that could of been one of the many things that messed up my previous attempts<br />-once in the file click the .exe file with the corresponding language, for english click the one ending in ENG.exe<br />-I let it install to the default setting which is the same file where it downloaded<br />-i restarted my comp here<br />-then go to the newly created two worlds II goty setup file (in the same file where you selected to where to set the download)<br />-go to install then common then double click twoworlds2.exe<br /><br />BE SURE to unplug an xbox 360 controller if you have one! this messes up the keyboard layout.<br /><br />I noticed some glitches after doing certain steps, to fix them i always restarted. If something isn't working always restart instead of re downloading the whole 20 gb AGAIN.<br /><br />Make sure you have update graphics card drivers aswell.<br /><br />Also the code for the expansion pack is in the downloaded file ending in flying fortress edition keys.html<br /><br />I hope this works for you! This is what i did after lookig around the internet. Now time to finally play the damn game!<br /><br />edit- u can register the game online and they send u an email saying thanks and give u an ingame code that unlocks something, guess what the freaking code was invalid, just another great example of a good game getting messed up in retarded ways
251	-1	The Ram II is a pretty underpowered tank with a high rate of fire.  Premium tanks are supposed to be credit earners but I found that this was not the case.  Buy your premium tank in game and pick a better one.  The gold included in this package was not any cheaper than in game gold.  There is nothing here that you can't get in game.  Cheers!
252	0	different
253	0	Didn't get code!
254	1	I was in a hurry to play with some friends and my Live membership was expired.  I knew Amazon had the membership for a cheaper price than what in-store prices would be so I bought off here.  After purchase, the online code was provided &#34;real nice and fast-like&#34; and I was gaming online within minutes.<br /><br />Definitely a good choice if you want the membership for a bit less $$$ and a lot less time than having it shipped (which is even cheaper :O)
255	-1	its not that I hate the game. I love all the nancy drew games I even ordered the box cd version of this one after this one refused to work. I got the digital download of another nd game from herinteractive s site and it worked great so I thought this one would work just as well but it wouldn't let my mouse move at all and the screen was frozen the entire time. the sound worked but nothing else did. it had nothing to do with available memory cuz I have tons of space I even deleted other things on my computer and redownloaded it and still nothing. so im very disappointed in the download version of this.
256	-1	It feels a little unfair to rate it one star when I didn't even get to play.  The download was incredibly slow and so I scrapped the game after an hour and a half of very little progress.
257	0	"Use origin to download these games. I had the \\""saferun.exe\\"" issue when I tried installing after the amazon downloader. Call EA customer support and they will trash amazons activation code for an origins compatible one."
258	-1	The icons are all too  small.  There are too many warnings too soon.  It never allows you time to make a lay out without pop up messages telling you to do something else.  Some of the better upgrades are so huge too you have to stick them way out of town.  The freeway on ramps won't go off an avenue.  If the next logical step of roadways is avenue to highways, there should be some way to incorporate them without tearing down half your city.
259	-1	DO NOT PROMOTE THIS BEHAVIOR<br /><br />This game is currently in alpha development. It was originally released on Steam for early access. Currently it holds many bugs, some of which are GAME BREAKING for certain players, such as corrupted save files. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME HERE. This action will open the flood gates of promoting such a behavior for other AAA Indie devs to release their INCOMPLETE PRODUCT on retail shelves!!!<br /><br />RETAIL LOCATIONS ARE NO PLACE FOR EARLY ACCESS / ALPHA STAGE GAMES !!!!!<br /><br />However, i do recommed that prospective purchasers keep an eye on this product, for it has the potential to be a incredibly fun game, and, in its current state, does have its pluses. If you wish to purchase this please do so on Steam THROUGH EARLY ACCESS. Any purchases of EA / Alpha stage games through retail outlets is a behavior that must be treated like a cancer and stopped before it spreads!<br /><br />DO NOT PROMOTE THIS BEHAVIOR FROM DEVS!!!
260	-1	Terrible execution.  Small maps, glitchy, more often does not work and can't launch.  I tried to like the game, but they really flubbed up the release.  You must connect to one of their servers, and the servers were overloaded.  Nothing like working on a city for a couple of hours only to have all your progress lost because of some error on the server end.
261	-1	"I should have known. EA killed the C&C franchise, now they've laid their sights on SimCity.<br /><br />The first problem I have, like everyone else, is the servers. I did not buy this game to play with others, I just wanted to build cities. I don't need leader boards. I need a game. The servers are consistently down, and their \\""scheduled\\"" maintenance comes in the form of a blog post at 10AM the day they're shutting down the servers and they choose a relatively \\""peak\\"" time to do it for some of them (ie 8:15 PM in the time zone the server is supposed to serve). All saves are server side, so if your server is down, tough luck, go through the tutorial on another!<br /><br />Now on to actual game play (which I've had little of, but enough to give a review). The AI is terrible. I've had fire trucks drive around in circles, ten of them going to one fire, while the building next door is blazing. I've had ambulances drive past an injured person's house TWICE before stopping. The play area for a single city is tiny. I get that its supposed to be a \\""region\\"" type of game play, but still, its too small to really enjoy entirely. Trade and commuting between cities is a little wacky too.<br /><br />In the end, I cannot recommend this game as it is. I'm praying that EA fixes the bugs and I can enjoy it. Its has the potential to be a GREAT game, but EA released a broken game, no two ways about. I'm sticking with it, just because I want it so much, but don't buy it now."
262	0	Pretty addictive and enjoyable for a while, but HIGHLY randomized. Running through multiple levels without finding anything useful while gear degrades and items run out gets pretty discouraging after a while. Still, for the price i felt it was worth while.
263	1	amazing game. my son really loved it.
264	1	I'm very glad I held off on my review until after giving it a little time.  Else, I to would be complaining about the initial server issues.  Thankfully, those problems seem a thing of the past only unfortunate to those of us who pre-ordered and those who bought at release.<br /><br />The game itself is quite remarkable and the teamwork aspect is great!  I game with the gunslingergaming.com community where friendly teamwork is a staple but I could see how teamwork could hinder a city as well.  Thankfully, you can make private regions to avoid having neighbors who merely drain their neighbors resources and if gaming with others isn't your thing, you can populate the region with just cities run by you if you'd like sole control of your destiny.  I would say a more apt title would have been SimRegion or SimCity: Region as what your neighbors are up to very much affects your growth and you theirs.  But I'm certainly not going to really gripe over a title.<br /><br />If you're buying this game expecting a past SimCity title, there in lies most people's problem.  It will take some getting used to dealing with a more limited space in which to build and dealing with somewhat finite resources(although some careful planning can even replenish those).  But while others view this as a deal breaker, I accept it as the challenge it is.  If you're looking for the SimCity's past, the great news is those games are still for sale and functioning so there's really little to complain about this one's existence.<br /><br />The game would get the full 5 stars had I not been one of those who suffered the initial server problems.  I would also like to see them separate the chat window feature to have player chat in one area with regional city achievements appearing somewhere else as there's quite a lot of achievement clutter to sift through for chatting/planning if in one of the larger regions.
265	0	Its ok.  This is the first shooter game I have ever played on PC, and I was pretty much addicted for months.  I don't play it that much anymore because the maps are too big and most game modes are lame.  But its decent.
266	0	Ubisoft is  a terrible company and this game is riddled with problems.
267	1	bought it and redeemed in less than 1 min.... just the way it should be.<br /><br />totally recommend it.<br /><br />I need to buy a bigger card ;P
268	1	this game had incredible graphics great game play quality<br />i loved the customize options<br />great game I would recommend it
269	-1	Seeing how the game + premium was on sale for $40.00 last month infuriated me.<br />This game wasn't even a year old. What EA should have done is delay the game/what dice should have done is not add so much stuff to the game because obviously their engine cant handle it. With all these people talking about netcode.. its because they added way to many things to the environment; well thats my opinion.
270	0	After playing 4k battles I have to say, stay away from WoT. Once you grind/pay your way to the tier 9/10 tanks the game is ruined by tier 7/8 artillery. Higher tier.. the tactics consist of hiding behind any hard cover to avoid artillery.<br /><br />They completely dictate the outcome of any battle more then 3 per side are in. They splash damage of 600+ often, direct hits will be 1200+ to 2000+.<br /><br />WG themselves simply DO NOT CARE even tho the forums are livid with complaints, US and EU. If you want to play and never spend a dime and stick with tier 1-7 then it can be fun.<br /><br />They should stop misleading people and rename the game World of Artillery (supported by various tanks)<br /><br />I'm simply hoping to reach as many future customers as I can to save you from giving them any money. It's very hard to run tier 10 without spending some money at least once, buying a premium tank or just paying for a premium account each month. If WG won't listen to their customers.. maybe income lost from future payers will hit their pocket book enough to get a response.
271	0	Great game, lacks instruction manual, and from what I can tell it also lacks any way to utilize the multi-player function!
272	1	Nice little game. Easy to learn, can be played for just a few minutes or for hours at a time. Good way to relax.
273	0	Runs very slowly at times(unless they have improved it since i downloaded it) the missions though are awesome! the game lost points for me because of the slowness and glitchyness(i have a high end machine). Adjust settings alot is my advice
274	1	EASY TO BUY, EASY TO USE, AND IS AN AMAZING GAME
275	1	I played a trial version online and just had to have the entire game. Download time was fast and the quality was good. The price is good to. I beat it in 1.5 days :)
276	1	This game.  Awesome.  Both versions were super cheap for download.  Absolutely loved and enjoyed them.  Well worth the purchase. If this goes on sale again, get it!!
277	1	This is cute game. My nieces and nephew love it.
278	0	This game is alright, but it's ruined completely when the client desynchronizes with the servers. This problem has existed for years, since alpha and they refuse to fix it.<br /><br />I wouldn't get into this game if you enjoy competitive play or hardcore modes from Diablo series.
279	0	I paid very cheap for this! The game has alot of glitches and it freezes alot! You will run into problems but im sure some forums out there to fix these issues!! wish I didn't have to deal with trying to fix the game first then to just play right away
280	0	"Like other video games from Amazon, this one downloaded & installed easily.  There are a couple aspects of this game that I find frustrating, though.<br /><br />Some of the answers don't really relate to the question.  For instance,the number one answer to \\""name a soup served at a Chinese restaurant\\"" is Chicken Noodle.  Now, maybe I've just visited the wrong Chinese restaurants, but I don't recall seeing chicken noodle soup on the menu.  If that answer had a low count, I could understand it.  But, supposedly chicken noodle was chosen by over 50% of respondents.<br /><br />The other thing that frustrates me is that this game locks up my computer like no casual game ever has.  I'm a frequent casual gamer.  My laptop is relatively high end & greatly exceeds the requirements of this game.  The issue may well be my laptop, but this has never happened with any other game.<br /><br />When it works right, which is most of the time, the game is blandly fun."
281	0	Graphics could have been much better.  I didn't pay attention to the overall story...because I'm more interested in just working the hidden object part.
282	1	I had the older version of this and loaded the new one on my new computer.  It was worth all the trouble and satisfies my gaming desires.
283	1	so so good
284	0	I purchased the game desiring to learn the mechanics and then play online mano v mano. However when trying to connect online all I get is invalid CD Key. Obviously there isnt any security on the software keys from the employees, they must be using them with thier friends. I wrote a complaint desirng a refund and they issued a new key. No instructions on how to switch the keys in the registry. so I had to resort to uninstalling rebooting and re-installing. Amazing no request for a key after second install, however go online ERROR  Invalid CD KEY again.    If it isnt resolved after this last complaint I will demand a refund and go buy a legitimate game at a brick and mortar store. I have serious doubts about ever purchasing licensed software from Amazon again, since it seems there is no security on the keys and any they issue are invalid online.
285	0	Shift 2 is overally good with its kind of realism it offers but this depends on your point of view of this game... also if u played shift 1 ... 2 doesnt got too much to offer... if I have to say most noticiable news is Night race and camera from helm... yup thats all.
286	0	The some of the puzzles were very difficult, therefore it was a challenge.  However, I reached one point in the game and I got an error message.  I don't remember exactly what it said, but I was unable to go any further in the game.  Otherwise, the game was was okay.
287	-1	I purchased this and downloaded it twice. You have to go through Origin to play it. So I signed up with them had to jump through hoops to keep them from collecting and putting my info out there for all to see. Then I could not get the game to play. Canceled hoping to get my money back.
288	0	This is the first game of this type I bought and played. I found it diverting for a while. It looks nice with carefully drawn, crisp and detailed images presented. But I found the logical and narrative structure of the game frustrating most of the time. There were gaps of logic and storytelling that made it hard to be immersed in the experience. Information was often entered in to the journal before it was `discovered' in the game world by reading a newspaper or note for example. There were silly procedures too. For example, at one point you need to put out a fire in a fireplace. You collect a bucket of water, but it won't put out the fire. You have to find a different bucket of water later before you can put out the fire. The game is frequently punctuated by a repetitive mini-game where you are presented with a still scene jumbled with objects, out of which you have to find 16 or so, in order to be given one of those objects which will actually be used in the game. There is no attempt to justify the logic of this pointless object searching game, and after 3 or 4 repetitions it becomes tedious. You are congratulated for coming up with such a great idea for dealing with the last ghost despite not having thought of the idea at all. The `good idea' is all set up neatly for you when you arrive on the scene.<br /><br />The closing story is hurried and disappointing, all too eagerly setting up a sequel without giving any real sense of closure here.<br /><br />So, it's a cheap way of passing a bit of time, but you can get much better and longer games for $5 on Amazon so why bother with this?
289	-1	WILL NOT DOWN LOAD
290	-1	Is not what I thought it was...opened it once and never opened again...it is too slow for me. What a waste of money....?
291	-1	Lots of hype, however the game can be annoying, and the player-match-up sucks.  Nothing worse than going in as a level-4 and being stuck in a game with people who have nothing better to do and have gone around the dial a few times..<br /><br />Oh well, graphics are great, and it's a fun diversion... It would have been better if it had a single-user story mode.
292	0	Mass Effect was a great series, if you are here you probably want to finish the story and see what your decisions have influenced. And you should! But take it with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Instead of having richly involved conversations and interesting relationships, interactions, for the most part, have been reduced to on-screen text while you walk by people. Basically, if you don't stand next to someone pointlessly while they talk, you will miss plenty of the story as you will be tempted to walk on by. Without any spoilers, the ending is lackluster, and everything seems a little dumbed down (story-wise). This saddens me because they created such a rich universe to play upon and instead of building on something grand, they take advantage of their hard work in the past by never honestly revealing anything new or actually answering many questions. It reminds me of the ending of Lost. I had a good time, but I want my brain back.<br /><br />Good news is that the multiplayer is fantastic, although I doubt anyone will be playing it in a year, and the combat system is a lot of fun.<br /><br />Graphically, it is indistinguishable from Mass Effect 2, which is probably due to restrictions on consoles.<br /><br />So enjoy the ending, hopefully you don't expect much and the few surprises you get will be even better that way. Expect less, get more.
293	1	This was cheaper than anyone else and I got it in less that 2 hours I was back online and playing in minutes it was fantastic. I did my research and this was 15 dollars less than every other place! I'm buying my Xbox live from here for now on.
294	1	The game is a decent bargain now, but not spectacular.
295	1	I purchased this and had 12 months on my account within a minute. To those who have had issues, it is a code to apply to your account. Not sure what the download program from Amazon would be able to do. Just use the product key on the Curse site (make sure you didn't include any spaces before or after the code or it won't work). Very simple.
296	1	Got just what I wanted
297	0	I bought this stuff pack just because it was on sale. I don't really use any of the items that are included. Sometimes I use them whenever I am creating some sort of &#34;entertainment&#34; sim like a singer, acrobat, etc. The items are cute, but I wasn't impressed. If it goes on sale buy it.
298	-1	i just finished downloading and it when trying to run it says disk write error 705 i run as administrator /change location / gain more disk space same thing ..this is my amazon download and im already feeling dissapointed need help now.
299	0	I recommend everyone just downloading that game client from ubisoft and then installing ghost recon from there ... Otherwise its a pain in the butt to get this game running on Win 7 ...
300	0	Origin.  I hate you so much......Just run without a steam knockoff or run on steam.  Origin isn't a bad program at all,  its just completely unnecessary.  I would rather just run this old style like off of a disc with no back program or anything.  Good game,  just launching it is more of a pain than it should be.
301	1	"First of all, I don't understand why people give a game a 1 star review because it requires Uplay.  That has nothing to do with whether or not the game is good.  And make no mistake, this game is good.<br /><br />The world:<br />In my opinion, this is the single most important aspect to nail down in games like this, and Watch Dogs does a good job.  Obviously there will be plenty of comparisons to GTA5.  And while Watch Dogs ultimately falls short of GTA5's glory, it's still a darn good game in it's own right.  I think I would have been really impressed with the game's rendition of Chicago if GTA5 hadn't set the bar so high already in it's depiction of SoCal.  This is easily the 2nd best \\""world\\"" in games of it's type.  Many have complained that it lacks soul, but it actually did begin to grow on me as I progressed through the game.  No, it's not over the top and zany like Saints Row or GTA, but it's not a flat, bland world of cookie cutter buildings either, and the underground hacker vibe starts to take on a life of it's own.  Additionally, being able to learn information, albeit limited information, about nearly any citizen you see lends it's citizens a certain human aspect that's not apparent in other games.  Hacking into people's laptop cameras to spy on their private lives has a guilty pleasure about it, and many of the things you'll witness are funny, tragic, sexy, etc.<br /><br />Story/Characters:<br />The story line is pretty decent, but nothing earth shattering.  I found myself less interested in Aiden getting revenge for his niece's death than I did for the other story lines in the game such as the human trafficking ring, and DedSec's (a hacker group eerily similar to the real life hacker group Anonymous) desire to take down ctOS, which is the Orwellian company that has monopolized all things digital in the name of safety and convenience.  Aiden Pearce, the game's protagonist, is fairly cliche although not an unlikable character.  Jordi is a sadistic and ruthless Asian man who helps Aiden from time to time.  Claire is an emo hacker chick with questionable motives.  Most of the game's other characters are believable except for one, Raymond Kenney.  Kenney's supposed to be a legendary hacker that's gone completely off the radar, but when you finally meet him he feels more like a dumb hillbilly than a legendary hacker.  I think they were trying to avoid a stereotypical nerd with glasses and a pocket protector as being the best hacker, but they went too far the other direction and Kenney just isn't believable as someone smart enough to do what he's done.  He'd feel more at home cracking open a beer can in a trailer park than being the best hacker in Chicago.<br /><br />Graphics:<br />The graphics are pretty good on high settings.  I can't say that the game looks a great deal better than GTA5 did on Playstation 3 though, even with settings on high.  Rain effects look realistic and the character models look nice, with the exception of Aiden's sister who looks a little bland.<br /><br />Driving:<br />Many have complained about the game's driving physics, but I had no problem.  It's not quite as \\""fun and easy\\"" as GTA5 but not quite as realistic as GTA4.  Probably somewhere in between.  Aside from buildings, cars and trees, pretty much everything is destructible so you won't spend a bunch of time crashing into things that slow your momentum, you can just plow right through and keep on going.  The boats in the game feel similar to GTA although they seem to be much faster.<br /><br />Hacking/Puzzles:<br />Even if this game had no driving or shooting, it could nearly stand alone as a puzzle platforming game.  Unlike in other Ubi titles such as Assassin's Creed, solving the \\""climbing/platforming\\"" puzzles is actually fun in this game, especially when combined with accessing different security cameras to give you viewpoints otherwise unobtainable, which are then used to solve parts of the puzzle.  Some puzzles require equal parts platforming and hacking of cameras, and each puzzle seemed fresh and not overly challenging, but still rewarding when completed.  The hacking mini-game was one I wasn't too fond of, you basically rotate T or L shaped joints to allow the \\""info\\"" to carry on through the lines to it's destination.  Most of them aren't too difficult but they're not exactly fun either, so I find myself grumbling when another one would pop up.<br /><br />Shooting:<br />Shooting works as well as most other 3rd person shooters.  You can choose to go in guns blazing or try to take a more measured, stealthy approach and each side feels equally as balanced and challenging in most situations.  Leveling up grants you points you can spend in skill trees to upgrade your abilities in hacking, combat, driving, etc.<br /><br />Side missions:<br />There are plenty of side missions available.  Some require you to steal and deliver vehicles to a specific location before a clock expires, some require you to lure the cops' attention and then lose them so that your buddies can pull off a crime elsewhere, there are missions that require you to take down a convoy of enemies before they reach their destination, and there are missions that have you infiltrating a stronghold of enemies and eliminating them.  There are also mini games such as chess, drinking games, poker, etc.  Digital trips offer a break from reality and have you terrorizing the city in a mechanical spider tank, mowing down demons in an armored muscle car, shooting aliens with laser guns, and sneaking through a dystopian city while hiding from killer robots.  None of them compared to the campaign missions, but many of them are worthwhile and I found myself completing all of the optional missions, which is rare for me.<br /><br />Final verdict:<br />I have a feeling that if this game had released before GTA5 did and hadn't come with a slew of technical issues right out of the gate, it would be a unanimously well-received game.  I enjoyed it much more than Saints Row 4 and GTA4, but GTA5 set the bar ridiculously high and Watch Dogs falls just short of that mark.  Don't let that dissuade you from playing it though, I had a blast with the game and probably played for at least 40-50 hours, and will eagerly await any DLC that comes.  Don't let the Negative Nancy's out there skew your opinion of this game before you play it, it's a really good game and if you enjoy games in this genre at all, you'll love it like I did.tforming and hacking of cameras, and each puzzle seemed fresh and not overly challenging, but still rewarding when completed.

302	-1	I've only been able to play the game for a couple of hours since launch, and every city created during that time was promptly deleted/lost. EA's strategy is to act as if the problems are isolated. They leave all the servers up to the point where it looks like you can log in, but once you are in nothing will load.<br /><br />Even when they get the servers going, you can see that EA's plan is to nickel and dime us for expansions/bigger cities/more stuff.<br /><br />This could have/should have been one of the greatest games of all time. The potential is great, but you can tell it was rushed out the door before it was ready. The game itself is buggy, and there are a lot of poorly thought out aspects that leave you scratching your head.
303	0	You have to REALLY like hidden object games to not get bored with this. At first it's quite interesting with plenty of nice graphics and facts about London, but then you keep going back to the same landmarks over and over again to find objects that you start to remember the locations of because they stay in the same place. There are a few other puzzles here and there like word finds and such, but the game doesn't actually require any more skill than good vision.
304	-1	It was horrible it installed a virus on my system DO NOT BUY
305	1	Pretty good game for myself and my toddler sister.
306	0	I love hidden object games and this one was just okay, the story line was a little on the dull side.  The end of the game was the biggest disappointment for me, it just sort of stopped, 'the end'.
307	0	It is a bit difficult to learn all the intricacies of the game, but worth the investment of time to do so.
308	-1	Doesn't download correctly - what a waste of money
309	1	This is one of the greatest tycoon games i have ever played! Very good and worth buying! Im playing it right now and it is very fun and easy to create a basic prison!
310	1	made it look fun and badass.
311	-1	Did not work on my computer
312	1	I loved the bundle.  I've wanted to play the original McGee's Alice for awhile and this is the only way to get it.  Fighting mechanics get pretty repetitive and 100% completion is tedious at best but the underlying story is wonderful.<br /><br />The screen resolution is a bit buggy in the old version, but it's to be expected for a game over 10 years old.
313	1	Awesome game with awesome story line.....but why do they have 2 kill jhony gath.Anyway the best part is that u will enjoy each and every momentum of this game.
314	1	Initially, I resisted the temptation to try this game, just because I hadn't been a big fan of some of the later Final Fantasy games, however, my sister  convinced me to give it a try. I was able to order it quickly and easily, get my free trial going, and get into the game very quickly. The game is a great deal of fun, very easy to pick up and learn, and has a variety of  options that allow you to really have fun with it. If you are a fan of the old final fantasy games, you'll find a lot of nostalgic  nods to previous game, as well as familiar themes and  things that are a tradition in ALL the games (Spoiler alert: Biggs and Wedge are in it. Like they are in EVERY game).  But it also has a  lot of unique features  and really  keeps the feel of the series alive.<br /><br />One of my favorite features is that you can have the same character be multiple classes. That's right, you can level multiple classes, on the same character, to  50.  There are also 'Job' classes, that is, advanced classes you can unlock by  leveling  combinations of certain classes. These give you special abilities  you would not otherwise get.  You can also  have action slots that allow you to use certain spells and abilities from other classes, meaning you can really  build a strong character, and it benefits you to level multiple classes. And to those who worry it will be too difficult, keep in mind that the larger the difference between your highest class and  the one you're playing, the more of an xp bonus you get. This makes it  painless and fun leveling up and working towards your goals.
315	0	It's ok, but its not as good as X-com EU, only buy if you like 3rd person shooters and the price is 5$ or less on sale otherwise avoid.
316	1	Easy, painless code reception via email.
317	0	This game isn't terrible, but it's definitely set more towards a younger audience which is to be expected. It's still a fun game with decent graphics.<br /><br />Overall it'll keep you or your child entertained for a few hours.
318	1	Excellent
319	-1	Not enough gameplay
320	1	I was reluctant to download a game but tried, and I am very pleased.  The game takes a long time to complete, but not difficult.  If you like this type of game, finding objects, it is perfect.  Charming, lots of objects to find, very colorful.
321	0	First what I like.....The graphics are fantastic. Now what I don't really like... The game play is bland.  There is nor &#34;strategy&#34; involved in the game.<br /><br />It is still enjoyable to play, you do not have build massive armies and conquer your neighbors, you can explore and build your empire.  There are many factors that you cannot control, but you can adjust for (e.g., type of construction and research).<br /><br />It is a great game to just play and build an empire. Don't expect to much and just enjoy the graphics.
322	0	There are a lot of hackers in this game still I bought this for friend and he stated he gets sniped while inside buildings with no windows and what not.
323	-1	"Your goal is to keep your Sim's happy. If you kept every Sim happy you would have no people and all services and be out of money. They would still complain because there are no places for people to live.<br /><br />All they did was upgrade SimCity 1 and somewhat connected the little towns<br /><br />The statements are true no subways and freeways reason: the \\""city's\\"" are too small and go nowhere except a road leading into your \\""city\\"", there are Seaports and trains in some \\""city's\\"" they also lead nowhere.<br /><br />The city sizes are a little smaller than the smallest cities in SimCity 4; SimCity 4 had three size cities.<br /><br />The casinos, Concert Halls, Expos and Street cars are cool but take up a lot of space you do not have it is worse when you add hills and water<br /><br />plan to sit around doing nothing for long periods of time due to the slow loading programs that forces you to be online to play the game yet you can make your game private. Every time you enter into a city your wait time is 9 to 20 min per city to load. I have a 1,000gbs,<br /><br />TIP. Buy the 39.00 and then upgrade once you have your purchase the game will give you the opition.<br /><br />DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIMITED AND DELUXE:<br />The Deluxe Edition: You get a high speed rail from Germany, a junky police station from Paris and a double decker bus station from England. I have had big ben and the Eiffel tower and the city did not change in any way<br /><br />THE UPGRADE COST for the \\""Deluxe Edition\\"": 20 dollars for all of the above or 10 dollars per item above.<br /><br />I sent 26 thousand crates of TVs to two cities and the city's never got them. Yet the city I sent it from said they sent them. I had to try to do that because the City making the TVs was no longer sending TVs to the Great Work. Hhhehehehehehehe<br /><br />No Churches. This version has sewage that looks like number two throughout the city.<br /><br />¬º of the time I lose what I did in a city. I have several \\""cities\\"" that I can no longer enter because it says error.  After waiting 15min or longer it says cannot enter city or I just get tired of waiting. I did install correctly. The first time I did not but the second time I did. Still had the same problems."
324	0	My daughter and I played this together. Its cute and we had fun. It's kind of limited as far as choices, but not bad. She really loves fashion games and its hard to find some good ones. This one isn't too bad.
325	1	As expected. Fast & easy way to charge your ps store.
326	1	I just started playing this game a couple months ago, but I'm hopelessly addicted. With this I got a ton of new perks like making up to twelve characters on a server, species unlocks (they're only unlocked as long as you're subscribed), ability to send mail with item/money attachments, price drops, up to three crew skills at a time on a character, and a ton more.<br /><br />When you buy it, it comes with a download. Open the download and select &#34;View Keys&#34; or something like that, and it will open a window in your internet browser with the subscription code. Go to the SWTOR website and redeem the code and you'll immediately become a subscriber. Once you've done that, you can delete the download. I think it's only so that they make sure the buying gets the code and not someone else.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy I bought this and it's feeding my addiction nicely.
327	0	Some good games, and some bad - would probably buy for someone else if it went on sale, again, though.
328	1	Love it, it keeps me entertained whether 5 minutes or a couple of hours at a time.  Give it a try.
329	0	"Just like so many others, I am on a mac (Leopard 10.5.8 with \\""supported\\"" graphics card) and have been experiencing the freezing horse problem since I downloaded it a few days ago. Seeing a horse, interacting with a horse, and (heaven forbid!) owning a horse is absolutely impossible. I end up having to force quit the game (and you all know how long it takes for the game to restart...ugh). Puppies and kittens are all adorable and wonderful and have creative interactions, i love it! But I did spend my money on this mostly to play with horses.......so.....  I'm also completely disappointed that the game has been out since October and there STILL isn't a fix for this ridiculous problem. I've turned the graphics down all the way (which has resulted in awful gameplay) and it still freezes...so no point in that. I'm going to try and upgrade to Snow Leopard with my fingers crossed that this will fix the problem. If you decide to take the risk, good luck and I hope the game works for you."
330	1	Beautifully made, such fun to play
331	1	"I enjoyed this game. Small problem toward the end when, according to the walkthrough: \\""It will activate and a sunbeam will go through it and it will open a wall area.\\"" Hmm, got the sunbeam but no wall area opened. Got all sparkly like something was there, but I clicked just about every pixel and can't get a \\""wall area\\"" to open so that I can find the final gem and finish the game. Nobody else mentioned this, so it might be just something in my computer that hiccuped at that point and stalled the game. Seems that I was almost done anyway. Again, good game to that point and I recommend it."
332	-1	This is a horrible game! All this does is just freeze on me, every time I went on Create A Sim, at some point it would freeze on me. Sometimes, I actually had luck, and created my family, but then it would freeze once they got into their new home. I am absoutly not impressed with this game. I was so excited and heard good things about this game, and I'm sure its great without the freezing, but otherwise I'm not impressed. I went to uninstall the game then reinstall just having the nightlife expansion pack. But that totally kept bailing on me when I went to the launcher. I would not get this game, and try getting new games of sims other than the double deluxe. Good Luck!
333	1	I was a little skeptical at buying it as a download, especially with the other reviewers that had difficulties but my download went great. The game is fun if you are a sims fan. I got bored of it quite quickly.
334	1	Great set of games!<br /><br />Like others have said, no steam keys for DoW Gold and Dark Crusade which is a bummer. =/<br /><br />My only real complaint is I wish you could see which ones have Steam Keys and which ones don't without having to open up each item link.
335	1	potatoes are awesome and I like pie with extra pie on the side of my wallet so shut the front door
336	0	I have seen many videos on YouTube of this game it seems great but every time Metroplex fires a missile at the Decipticons it crashes on me! I would recommend this game for ps3 and the xbox360 but not for pc to me it was a waste of money to buy this game for pc
337	-1	Game don't work at all in full screen, it just give a black screen and sound stuttering, i've found is a common problem with amd cards like mine (290x) and ea know this since the launch but haven't solved yet.
338	-1	Installs ok but when I go to play it the game does not start. Plus it took over 2 hours to &#34;PC Download&#34; You should be a bit more informative prior to selling this product.
339	-1	DRM issues aside, this game shouldn't have been released so soon, a lot of features are broken. EA should be ashamed.
340	0	none of these downloads work for vista--amazon downloader is not functional on my system
341	1	Keeps my grandson busy.  He absolutely loves this game and plays it all the time.  He calls to tell me what level he is at.
342	0	the 2nd one is good, i liked it alot!<br />but the 3rd one, i cant get anywhere with it. stuck because i cant find some hiden tresure :(
343	1	a lot of fun
344	-1	I was not pleased that I had to download software to open the game.
345	0	Kind of fun in that you can't find to many games anymore that are expressly Rally type games.  Graphics were probably great for it's time and still hold up somewhat. Fun game though.
346	-1	I recently purchased and attempted to play Black Miror 2. The gameplay was enjoyable except for a problem with FREEZING at various parts of the game. After visiting several forums it is quite apparent that MANY people have experienced the same problem. WHERE IS THE PATCH WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY NEEDED? So far, a wste of money, unfortunately. BTW, this is english download version.
347	-1	The game runs like crap even on a gaming computer, the amount of glitches and control errors will drive you crazy. TOTAL waste of money. Pure Junk.
348	-1	This game is not a good one to get from Amazon. The game that they give you is unplayable without a critical patch that you cannot install on top of this version of the game. Buy it on Steam or another service that installs updates for you if you really want to play this game.
349	0	Sniping is always great fun so any game that offers plenty of it has to be a good thing. The sniping in SNIPER ELITE V2 is (as I understand it) pretty realistic. It includes all the conditions that would effect such a task in the real world, including bullet drop, wind speed and direction, body movement etc. There‚Äôs no denying the satisfaction when you score a hit, especially a headshot, and this is often augmented by the enjoyable spectacle of the bullet flying through the air in slow-motion towards its target. Personally, I could have lived without the kill-cam‚Äôs depiction of the victim‚Äôs injuries, but this is only a game so let‚Äôs not get too wrapped up in the ethics. Less successful is the close-quarter combat that you are sometimes forced into. The cover-based stealth system is less sophisticated than in some games (Deus Ex: Human Revolution, for example) and aiming at close range can be problematic. This, coupled with a ridiculously keen-eyed AI, can prove frustrating. The graphics are good to very good, with the ruins of a war-torn Berlin particularly well depicted. The story is rather fractured due to the mission-based gameplay but SEV2 isn‚Äôt really about story, its about honing your long-range shooting skills, and this it does well.<br /><br />3.5/5
350	-1	Did not like it!  Got it as a gift and my nephew could not get signed on to play even with his mom's help.  Gave her my password stuff to sign in with my account and it still did not work.  Thinking of asking for my money back.
351	0	I had the 95 version..was hoping they had a newer version and now I finally have it..It is not as good as the 7th guest but I like the puzzles and story line...
352	-1	stuck own a level I cant get past but its is a ok game
353	-1	EA stated that this train wreck of a launch would be avoided many times in their press releases. HOLD YOUR MONEY UNTIL EA FIXES THIS!
354	0	It's fun to play but not enough levels
355	-1	haven't been able to play it yet....the computer crashes every time.  Wish I could get my money back on this
356	-1	So I just purchased this digital copy of this game and it's not even working right. It installs and that's as far as it gets, I don't know if it's the windows version or the product itself.
357	-1	I would hold off on buying this digital key. Expansion I 'The Dark Below' should be released sometime in Decemeber (2014). Asper gamestop, Expansion II should be released sometime towards the end of Jan 2015. Its a good game but not worth keeping 4/5 months. That being said its a waist of money.
358	0	This game is ok, but is not as responsive as the older game.  I like the colors better in the old game.  It's too bad that the old software doesn't work with Windows 8.  Also, I can't play full screen with this software on Windows 8.  The cursor disappears.  Not really a fan of this game anymore.  The 'creatures'? Not really exciting.  The older version of this game is much more fun and relaxing. If I had it to do over, I would not buy this game.
359	-1	Never got code
360	0	I love the series and I almost liked it better than the third Westward. BUT I couldn't figure out how to replenish the wood resource. In the third game, you just buy saplings and plant them to build up your forest again. Then there's your replenished supply of wood. But here in the second one, I couldn't for the life of me find any way of replenishing the wood. I ran out early on and looed and looked but none of the buildings I saw sold more saplings or seeds. I could't building anything else since I was out of wood and was stuck. If there was a way around that, I never saw it. I would have given it only two stars for this, but the whole series is decent so I gave in three instead.
361	-1	"Initially this game had a lot of potential.  The crafting system looked great, the fact that weapons dictated your skills made sense but still had a great element of fantasy to it, the graphics are good, the stories starts out interesting, you (generally) just can't plow through mobs like it's 'ezmode', etc....  As it turns out though, it's just a bunch of cosmetics covering up the ugly underneath.<br /><br />Crafting:<br />The crafting system is tedious.  Not insanely tedious, but just enough to make it enough of an exercise in micromanagement that the bang for the buck isn't as rewarding as one might like.  It is nice that you can learn them all (though only two active at a time), but in the end...it's just not worth the effort.<br /><br />Weapons:<br />The weapons/skills make sense, especially for warriors.  What you have in your hands dictates what you can do.  You don't do a lot of stunning with a sword or axe, but your enemies will bleed a lot; put a mace (or two) in your hands and you're cracking skulls and so on.  However, the primary skills get a bit boring quick, and the skills you acquire as you level tend to leave a bit to be desired.  There are generally good trade offs though, and this is one of the highlights of the game overall.<br /><br />Combat:<br />Combat calls for a more interactive role from the player and takes a bit longer.  Even when you level and return to lower level areas, your level is reduced to a level comparable to the area (this has some impact, but I've found I can pretty much plow through areas well below my level, so I see it as more of a 'handicap' than anything else).  Because of the slower combat and the fairly quick respawn rates, if you get yourself into a corner, you either spend a lot of time fighting your way back out, or you teleport (handy), but then have to come back to the location if there is any unfinished business.  After a while, the combat seems to really drag on.  Another point I really have an issue with is howyou are defeated.  In one battle, you can be beat down to the ground, put up a (pathetic) resistance and come out victorious.  In another battle you can be destroying the enemy (until respawns show up), then you retreat a bit, get out of combat momentarily and end up defeated at nearly full health.  Just can't figure that one out.<br /><br />MMO Interaction:<br />The game in many areas is deserted and there is little to no interaction.  In addition, a lot of the actual \\""quests\\"" pretty much require a group which takes forever to do in many cases.  The server I'm on was high population when I joined it...but I'm not sure what constitutes that or if I missed some mass exodus.  Most chat is ignored, or worth ignoring.<br /><br />Leveling:<br />While many of the positive reviews that got me to purchase this game talked about how the game wasn't a grind fest and how you got experience from everything you do (which is true), the most efficient way to level I've found is grinding repeatable events.  Experience from crafting is a good by-product from wandering around and gathering stuff, but the return on investment is questionable.  Experience from regular kills is very low, along with discoveries.  Story line quests provide a significant amount of experience, but there are gaps you have to fill.  The leveling starts out slow...and only gets slower.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Like the title says, a lot of potential gone to waste.  There's a lot of promise in this game, but it just doesn't bring it all together in the end.  Additionally, the forums for the game are another thing.  I posted a topic on how I was rapidly losing interest in the game in the Guild Wars 2 General Discussion, which was promptly \\""infracted\\"" and deleted.  I gave specifics on some of the issues I had, in a professional tone (much the same way I've posted this review), yet I guess criticizing some aspects of the game and telling them because of that you're no longer having fun is against the rules.  Honestly, that's what pushed me to write this review."
362	-1	I CANT BUY BUY PLEASE FIX THIS NOW!!!!
363	-1	Unrealistic controls feel like RC boat and simple detail graffics are a little outdated and need huge improvements when compare to today gamings .
364	-1	so frucking boring
365	0	I had problems running it after download. When I did get it to finally run, it just wasn't worth the effort. Needs to be more difficult
366	0	"\\""This is one journey you will never forget.\\"" First of i must say this game was hyped and my expectations were enormous.<br />That said I honestly did not feel connect at all with both brothers nor did i find the storytelling that impressive(it's good) as some critics made it out to be. The world is gorgeous and feels fleshed out. The puzzles are lacklustre...not once did i feel challenged with one of the puzzles. This game leans heavily on it's story and you being emotionally attached to the brothers, i was not.  What was left is a predictable story and linear game where you hit invisible walls when going slightly of the pad . I was left disappointed when the credits rolled. Though it is not a bad game at all, i would give it a 6/10 and deserves a playthrough. Which will last 3 hours if you take your time. Not worth the full price."
367	-1	Ordered 2 separate $20 PSN cards, as you arent allowed to buy more than 1 of the same value at the same time, for some dumb reason. First one took longer than usual to process, but was available within a few minutes and was valid. Second, went through as usual and made available quicker than the first only to be non-valid. Support?? From what other reviews have said, no direct support for this type of item, and no help/support  option on order receipt or account page on website.
368	1	as expected & as advertised!
369	1	Its pretty awesome didn't have to leave my home to get it, instead of going to a store it was sent right to my email.
370	0	I needed something to do when I surfing the net or downloading music to itunes and this is it. Simple, fun, and ever changing if you don't like simulations stay far far away.
371	-1	A WASTE OF MONEY! Do not...I repeat, DO NOT buy this trash. Tutorial sucks, Gameplay sucks. Carry on.
372	0	the download went just fine and fast, the game is just fine. I would have to say that I'm more into adventure games that don't include HO scenes. To me I feel this game is well suited for 8-10 year olds. I finished the game rather quickly due to the simpleness of it. I use windows 7 pro-64 bit and everything ran just fine. If HOG's are what you like, then yes this would be a great game for you.
373	0	I don't think people should have to pay for new maps, they should be able to just download them like we used to do with old Rainbow Six multiplayer games. Barely anyone is online for Max Payne 3, DLC isn't worth the $$
374	1	i originally bought it to play with my clan members and think it is brilliant, the only downside is that you can only have 4 players at one time, other than that 10/10
375	-1	When I purchased this download there was no indication that sign-in to the Origins site would be required to start the game. I thought I was purchasing the full version with full user rights. The Origins software also prevents Windows from closing without having to go through the added step of closing it. A bad product.
376	-1	Hello EA,<br /><br />AGAIN! YOU DID IT AGAIN!<br />I bought this game now for the second time but again i got banned after 10 min of playing!<br />I want an new serial for premium and the game!<br />Now!
377	-1	Impossible to beat.
378	1	I was doubtful of this game when it first came out and had some reservations about some of its' business ideas. But I gave it a chance and have stuck with it ever since! It just keeps getting better all the time and is fast becoming one of my all time favorites! You can buy as many or as few planes, in addition to the ones that come with this version, as you want or none at all! You get to choose which planes you'll fly, which is very smart imho, and the added income just helps them support the game further. Win win in my book. I very good purchase indeed.
379	1	Dear<br /><br />Thank you for the product could you please cancel the order since i bought another card
380	-1	What a waste of money! SimCity is about single player. Get rid of this online play only deal and I'll buy. Ridiculous.
381	0	the game locked up and it I can't even click on the menu. I have to do a hard shut down. what I was able to play was fun.
382	1	Was a fun game, albeit a bit repetitious.  The detail that went into creating the Paris, Moscow and Washington DC battle fields were spectacular.  I found myself looking for major landmarks (which I found) in these cities.  Great interface and easy to learn.
383	-1	dumb game.
384	1	This game loaded perfectly and with no issues. The graphics are exceptionally good, a good story line, and not too many HO just right. The puzzles were great and not too hard. The movie sequences were very interesting and helpful in understanding the story line. The hint button helps out a lot. The medieval ear and espionage was intriguing. The only regret I have was that it was not the collector's edition because there is a bonus chapter. I will have to find that one as well. I highly recommend this game to any hidden objects game lover and to family and friends. This is really a GREAT GAME!
385	0	Not remotely sandbox. Very very linear...plays out exactly the same way every time. Just not impressive but kids will enjoy it.
386	1	Thanks :)
387	0	I didn't even bother finishing this game. Glitches day one made it unplayable and still the game has so many bugs. I totaled one of my vehicles in the game by running into a sand castle. It is fairly repeatability. Metal bars have as much durability as a wooden plank. It is also too easy. If you play smart, you never die. Graphics are pretty behind, this game had so much potential and kind of lost it. BUY THIS if you can find it on a good sale. great $10-$20 game MAX.
388	0	After playing the game, twice, in 3 days, I was very disappointed. I was expecting a better and longer gameplay than Dragon Age Origins. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are AMAZING, the gameplay incredible, but the time, well, just plain too short. I hope that Dragon Age Inquisition does not disappoint.
389	1	cool game
390	-1	I have been playing Football Manager and Championship Manager before that every single year since year 2000. This is by far the worst FM ever. Saving the game takes too long, and it crashes too often. You have to choose between wasting hours saving the game or wasting hours playing all your games over and over again. Injuries are out of control. My team constantly have at least 5 injuries year around. There are also bugs in the game. Weird things happen during the game. For example, a few times my goalkeeper watched the ball going into the goal slowly.
391	-1	Just bought for my DD, but can't try yet. You must have .NET 2.0 or 4.0 on your system...not sure if most do or not. Have to hunt it down, install, and then see how the game is. UGGH! Amazon should develop a thing that automatically detects if your machine is compatible with a game BEFORE you buy it.<br /><br />So tired of these issues :(<br /><br />D/l is at Microsoft site, FYI. But, good luck getting this game to run, even with the .NET. Junky crap!<br /><br />Edit to ad: Go to ftc complaint assistant dot com and file! Enough with these rip off vendors polluting Amazon's pages.<br /><br />Funny, they were able to successfully install malware, just not the darn game!
392	0	fun but crashes after 3 races
393	0	If you've played Batman: Arkham City and want more, you'll get it here. But I found the AC's DLC (Harle's Revenge) to be a chore and this feels like more of the same, despite the earlier version of the city, new bosses and fast travel. The puzzles, combat, and traversal are largely the same as Arkham City and the story does not seem particularly engaging (I'm a bit burnt out on the Arkham games at the moment, though). The new crime scene reconstruction mechanism wherein Batman can scrub forward and back in the temporal dimension is pretty neat, albeit very much a linear puzzle in essence.
394	-1	I'd love to rate this game higher, but the game stopped working after a week.  After numerous attempts to contact them, I have not even had an acknowledgement that they received a help request.
395	1	fun expansion
396	1	Great
397	1	A very nice game
398	1	This is a true classic. It's unbelievably fun and challenging. When I first bought this for my son over 15 years ago, I was amazed at how many levels it had. The more I watched him play, the more impressed I was with the game. Finally, I tried it myself, and I was addicted! I can't say enough about this game, except to highly, highly recommend it. Truly, one of the best video games of all time.
399	0	gift to Grandson
400	-1	ii Have no Idea why it Invalid Or Used But I Want My Money Back Wish I Can!..Yeah But I Think It's Just Sony
401	0	I love this game don't get me wrong but I recently bought a new computer that has windows 8. It seems to always want to close out of the game when I'm playing. Sometimes it will do it right away and other times I can play for a half hour or longer with no issues.
402	0	It is not very challenging because you can't choose the levels of easy, medium, or difficult.  But...it would be great and interesting with its' cute characters for a younger child or a person that hasn't played many games on the computer before.  I'd buy it again just because it is cute!
403	0	I like the game but it is such a system hog that you have to wait for the lag to play it. I have all the other Youda games and do not have the same problems with them. Youda is known for having great graphics.
404	0	Guacamelee is a unique game by a unique publisher. The plot's quasi interesting, but the mechanics are too specific to the Vita for an enjoyable experience.
405	1	This is awesome because it includes all major expansions as well as other premium events such as double xp, extra in-game assignments, awards etc. I bought this also because I have been waiting on a sale on the DLC. Amazon came through like they always do and I got a major discount on this item during a sale.
406	0	Purchased the game for my son to play, but there were a few problems with it downloading. Downloaded other games with no problem.
407	1	SEGA is awesome, keep delivering digital games to the PC people! I hope more Saturn games come in the future
408	1	Virtual Villagers - The Secret City, is the first game I downloaded.  Amazon made it a breeze and now I wish I could download all my games and movies!<br /><br />Also a FUN game!
409	0	good game, but not good as his predecessor dead space 2. If you like to play co-op with one friend its a good choice. Middle gameplay and story is not so exciting.
410	1	it works great on windows 8.1
411	-1	I cant believe i spent $25 on this worthless THING!!!! Next time i will NEVER EVER buy anything from amazon AGAIN! I am so surprised that they would even have a scam like this. Dont waste your money on this, I fell so stupid that i even bought this. Sham on me...
412	-1	Its really fun filling out the link over and over to have nothing happen! Somebody should fix this. It is very annoying!
413	1	Will you survive?<br /><br />Terrifying. Heart-pounding. The fabric of nightmares.<br /><br />Dying Light is in essence, FRIGHTENING. This is horror done right.<br /><br />Harran has recently hit an economic boom thanks to the discovery of oil beneath its soils. With this black gold now within the governmment's possession, development began and western influence creeped in and slowly took over. And then the plague hit. Rabies. No one expected someone to weaponize the virus...but they did.<br /><br />Crane. That's you. You're him. GRE Operative working undercover between warring factions in the epicenter of the Rabies plague; you're mission is to extricate a file containing delicate information in regards to the weaponization of this virus, pertinent to national security.<br /><br />As you progress the game, your skills increase exponentially. Running up walls, using a grappling hook to fly from building to building, vaulting over enemies, and somersaulting to land high jumps all become routine. You are able to modify various weaponry found with a plethora of blueprints that add DoT effects and increased damage for crafted equipment that really feels epic.<br /><br />Speaking of equipment, Dying Light has tons of it. You have plenty of melee weapons and ranged ordinance that are tweakable with blueprints to give you just the right amount of variety to keep the flow of the game engaging and never feeling stagnant.<br /><br />Stale. That's something you'll never feel when playing. The ambiance of an infected Harran and the hyper-realistic quality of Techland's Chrome 6 engine are to be commended. It is unbelievable what maximum settings do for atmosphere here. Everything is lush; movements have fluidity and polish while shadows, flames, electric currents, water, oil slicks, billowing smoke, flapping flags, and even birds in the air, all add to an intensely sinister and nightmarish reality that does an amazing job at mounting tension and giving you a jolt of terror.<br /><br />The music has a very eerie 80s synth-pop slash modern era dubstep hybrid feel to it, giving the game itself this ever-present dark cloud that looms constantly, ever present and promising the player a carnival wrought with fear and blood. I can't recommend highly enough the importance of playing this game with good audio equipment. The sound work on this game is truly topnotch. Playing at night in the dark with the volume cranked up really does induce goose bumps. Hearing a volatile scream echo in the hallways while walking through a multi-leveled abandon building is nerve wracking. The sounds of a Demolisher rounding his charge will make your blood curdle. And the infected toddlers in Sector 0..their cries will make you shutter.<br /><br />Having enjoyed this genre since Resident Evil on Playstation, and with my all time favorite being The Last of Us, I would have to say that Dying Light is a serious contender for one of the greatest in the category. It is a superb experience, and it can truly be horrifying. The intense combat mechanics, the ominous music, the hyper-real visual effects and great voice work all make for one white-knuckle, high octane pulse pounding thrill ride. Remember: safety in numbers. Zombies are easy 1 on 1, but as soon as there is more than 1..the game changes, drastically.<br /><br />Good night..and good luck./><br />The music has a very eerie 80s synth-pop slash modern era dubstep hybrid feel to it, giving the game itself this ever-present dark cloud that looms constantly, ever present and promising the player a carnival wrought with fear and blood.

414	1	this game was on my mind for a while and amazon gave me the best bang for my buck<br />this is the best series besides the total war series
415	0	Haven't reached the end yet, but I watched the spoiler before buying. Enjoying it for the most part, I thought it was a little racist that the one Latino character is all full of himself and swears at you. It'd be nice to have vehicle portions like in the first 2 games, but I like that you can mod your guns again, this was there in the first, but not the second. Game play seems like a compromise of the best features between the first and second Mass Effects. I heard that people got opinionated over the issue of homosexuality in the game, now I can see why. The first 2 games referenced it some, but it seems more prominent in this one. A little annoying but what ever. I greatly enjoy the multi-player aspect of the game even with it taking forever to call home to mommy and ask EA if it is all right for you to play your game. Also EA/Origin servers take 2-5 minutes to respond before you can 1-play the game, 2-play the game with dlc, 3-play online. Even with a good internet connection it will sometimes loose connection and tell you how terrible of a person you are and that you can't play dlc anymore. It makes me want to use a cracked version of it just because the DRM is a bigger issue to the people that buy the game than to those who pirate it.<br />I'd buy it again... if it was on sale.
416	1	I got this item for .98 from  Amazon, so I took a chance.  One of the things I like about the best is that it has a mode for children, too.  My niece, 8 and her brother, 5, both enjoy it.  Beside playing the game, they also just like to dress up the window mannequins. We each play under our own names, so no problem.  If you like time management games, this is fun, and there are new costumes and new upgrades at each level.
417	1	Muy recomendable
418	1	I was able to get this on sale, which made it way worth it! Playing these games takes me back to middle school!
419	1	This was my first RPG years ago. I finally found it on disc and bought it. It is a neat little game if you just starting out in RPG. For a beginner, I do recommend it!
420	0	but still some fun. nothing near the quality of say, Need for speed francise,<br /> but considering the low price I paid a decent value.
421	-1	Absolutely not worth the  price, no better A.I, just 3 (3!!!)  more missions, the possibility of a couple o different suits (just visual differences, no improvements) for soldiers, no bugs solving ( aliens still firing trough walls...)
422	1	Nice. fast. thick. solid. tight. literally it was as easy as buying it. code immediately. very nice. good buy. cool
423	1	TERA Online is a pretty standard MMORPG - think World of Warcraft.  The benefits of TERA, however, are that the graphics are much improved, the UI (User Interface) is much nicer and the game overall feels newer and more streamlined.  The fact that it went free to play with keeping all of the enjoyment of the paid version is also a bonus.<br /><br />The things I like about TERA is the community, the graphics, the world, and how easy it is to pick up and play.  Each class feels unique and there is something for everyone.  I also like being able to team up and dig into the big monsters or raid a dungeon for the rewards.<br /><br />What I don't like about this game is that it follows a standard MMORPG model, so much of it feels tired and done before.  There isn't anything too revolutionary.  There aren't any exciting things to do besides fight and level up and move from area to area. The combat system is nice, but when you realize it is the same as any other combat system except you're automatically moving the camera with your mouse without having to hold it down to look/move.  There's still mounts, spells abilities, parties, monsters, dungeons, PVP, PVE, and everything else you'd expect from an MMORPG.<br /><br />If you're looking to play a social online game with these themes, dump the subscription-based games and go F2P with TERA, you will not be disappointed.  If you do want something more developed and more original and exciting than the standard MMORPG, then this is not for you.  What it does, however, it does well.

425	1	Many professional reviews gave lower marks to KZ:M on release because of its unerring similarity to its console/PC shooter counterparts. It looks, sounds and plays just like you would expect from a modern military shooter on the PS3. For most people, this is Sony's (Western) promise for the PS Vita fulfilled--console/cinematic quality gaming on the go, a promise they began with the PSP but didn't quite fulfill until now.  KZ:M is one of the premier games that makes a case for the Vita's incredible processing power and dual analog setup, providing a heavy yet tight control scheme and offering a visual presentation on par with current gen AAA titles, if ever slightly diminished in feel and looks. Diminished, but still well defined: this is still one of the most technically accomplished, visually stunning titles on any mobile platform, and it plays very well.  Beyond the usual game modes you would expect in MP, such as FFA, TDM and Warzone, Killzone's signature take on rotating-objective based fragging, the single player portion of the title is no slouch. Offering 9 well paced, moderately lengthy missions with plenty of branching approaches, varied environments and plenty of ways to take on opponents, it is a lengthy campaign, make no mistake. This is before the other Contracts you can take on to earn more cash while playing with a specific loadout, various playstyles and completing extra objectives.  All this feeds into a loop of instant reward for your efforts--score headshots, stealth through areas, melee opponents, whatever it is, you are rewarded with cash. Cash is a shared pool between SP and MP, letting you build up an arsenal of weapons and gear to suit your playstyle/situation.  The VAN-guards are an excellent addition, and you'll soon discover every one has their use. Classic standbys like the Carapace personal shield return from Killzone, while others like the Mantis Engine are downright cruel and fun to use (if a bit broken in MP).  As of patch 1.08, Botzone has been introduced for a reasonable price of $2.50 as DLC. It's an excellent addition to KZ:M that truly elevates it to portable classic--play MP everywhere you go with or without internet. The AI both in SP and MP is believable and animated well, providing a stiff but surmountable challenge.  You could write this off as another military shooter with sci-fi trappings, but the fact that it's done so well and, moreover, plays to the strengths of the PS Vita's mobile nature makes it a must buy for every owner, unless you're absolutely opposed to the FPS genre.
426	-1	Second Life, once the premiere virtual world, has remained a technical wonder.  Today, however, has a bad case of faded glory.  For all it's technical expertise it has allowed it's customer support fade away.  Would I link Amazon and Second Life, NOT EVER! Could I recommend Second Life to my friends and/or co-workers, NOT ANY MORE!  Is SL still fun?  I suppose so if you enjoy dancing to the tune of a dinosaur with indigestion.  Sorry SL - once upon a time I really loved you.  Now I just tolerate you.
427	0	Seeing Rapure before the big disaster was definitely a thrill.What a beautiful place!Such nostalgia for anyone who ever played the original Bioshock! Booker is a noireish detective with seemingly no memory of the events of Infinite.Elizabeth is a tough Dame who apparently needs Booker's help.The Raptue portrayed in this game melds the original Bioshock with elements of Bioshock Infinate & cause one to think some sort of time-space event has occurred.Very interesting .The disasters that result in Raptue's downfall are pending but have not yet come to fruition.The story draws you in slowly but surely &  gains your full interest & then much too quickly ends in another surprise ending.<br />And that is my problem with it.A premature ending which leaves you hanging just when you are really getting into the game.You really want more.And to my mind the ending makes Elizabeth look like a vicious,spiteful (but still very attractive ) villainess. Time will tell if part two will resolve matters satisfactorily.I really hope so,because there is so much potential here.
428	-1	Do not buy it.
429	-1	I have played all the sim city games. I still have the original on my computer, and I enjoyed Sim City 4 Deluxe quite a bit. This game is a pain to even play single player, servers are constantly full or crashing, there are way more restrictions on what you can build, Sim City 4 is better in almost every aspect, learn from my mistake and don't but this crappy product.
430	-1	Not running under W7 64bits.<br />Lot of entrys on forums on internet.<br />Someone should consider to try to solve this issue.
431	0	Nice graphics but the game is very poor. I'm holding my evaluation so low .. Tr: Bey oyunun grafikleri berbat ama oynanƒ±rlƒ±k g√ºzel bilginiz olsun. :)
432	0	Not the best representant for the Disgaea series's. A lot of good concepts from Disgaea 3 and 4 were removed. Nothing good was added. The history itself does not add any relevance to Disgaea 1 and just seems like a cheap and sad sequence. The only good thing is the more polished graphics. Still I give it 3/5 because it's a Disgaea game. It will take hours of your life unnoticed, tangling you in deep tactical rpg battles, so rare those days at the ps3.
433	0	Would love to brag about how great it is, but yet to get the chance to play it, looks great from review, and animation looking forward to this game will update
434	1	Was great got it really fast
435	0	ok first off this is a cool game, plus support a controller in an MMO is just sweet BUT i do have some reservations as well. its a grind fest, not like kill mobs for days and thats it but your gonna quest your ass off to get to cap. PLus there is virtually lil to no story you find yourself loosing intrest in anything becuase its taking so long to really progress anwhere. by the time you reach end game cuz thats about it you have done so its end game, unless you wanna do the nexus which is unless you have a super machine lagggs so bad and they do have one raid now so all is not lost entirely.
436	-1	What more is there to say that hasn't been said...  you buy a game and you can't play it because you have to connect to servers that don't work...  Don't buy this game, you've been warned.
437	1	Love this game!!!! the best
438	-1	my game opened but kept freezing. i tried removing game & reinstalling.it. the same thing happened again & again.pls. correct or refund.brain teasers is a promising product if it works<br /><br />  mary apollo
439	0	I really haven't played too much of the game - What i can tell you is this is not Dungeon Seige I or II quality.  Not nearly as good.  Also the key doesn't redeem on steam(would be great if it specified this), but at 2.24 on sale today it is worth the money.  I have played it on vista 64 bit and it worked, i haven't tried it on win7 yet.  I think this might be a fun game for a kid to play but not enough to draw and hold the attention of this adult.
440	-1	Infuriating.  Going from screen to screen and back picking up items that the people in the area don't want to pick up.  Potion making is catching blue drops...I got to level three and deciding it was torture.
441	-1	I really feel the could be so much better. The graphics are not great. I have played much more entertaining games but it is what it is. Some people like it. It just isn't for me.
442	0	My son has the WarioWare D.I.Y. for his Nintendo. He thought this was pretty much the same thing, but for Wii. It's not. It simply allows him to play the games on his Wii that he created on his Nintendo. However, he can't create any games on the Wii. Still, he enjoys that he can send it to a friend who also has the WarioWare D.I.Y. for Wii and their Wii's are connected.
443	-1	This is far inferior to the amazing PC version, the Xbox controls kind of suck and take some getting used too.
444	-1	Overall Doom and Destiny is not a terrible game, but there's lots of room for improvement.  It's a classic 90's era RPG.  After getting through the main quest here's what I've learned:<br /><br />The good:<br />It's a 90's style RPG, I really love the genre<br />Unique story line<br />Bits chuckle worth humor mixed<br />Semi intelligent AI that doesn't just target random characters they actually pick on the chars they feel are the most dangerous either do to doing lots of damage or doing a lot of healing<br /><br />The bad:<br />The controls are clunky and there's no mouse support<br />No map when outside the main world so tracking where you've gone in dungeons all has to be done by memory<br />The MP cost of skills is very high compared to the total MP for the non-caster characters<br />Regular attacks (even from the supposed strong melee chars) are really weak compared to enemy HP so you have to resort to skills for piratically every attack.<br />The cost of items (not just weapons and armor, but HP/MP restoring items as well), are high in the store.  You do find a lot but you wind up buying a lot because of the mentioned MP points skill cost ratio.<br />The stat system needs to be rethought.  Character HP is tied to Str so if you want your caster (who is doing a lot of damage and therefore getting targeted) to have a decent amount of HP you have to dump a lot of points into Str.  Also XP gains are tied to Grit so if you don't want one char to be way ahead in levels it's best to try and keep them even.<br />The MP point skill cost ratio also forces a lot of wasted points for melee chars to be dumped into Spr to have a higher mana pool.<br />The inventory system needs a lot of improvement.  If an item is for only one class it's hard to tell which char it's going on, so I'm not sure if it's an upgrade or not.  There are also a few screens that tell you to push button 'A' to do something, but the 'A' is not even the default mapped button.  Luckily there are only 2 buttons that do anything so it's not hard to figure out what they mean.<br /><br />Overall if you can get this game for really cheap it's worth a try, but there are several free games of this genre you can play though gaming sites out there.  I usually hate it when reviews mention another game by name, but I'm going to mention one that's free.  If you like this genre you should try the MARDEK RPG chapters 1-3.  It's flash based and free to play on a few different gaming sites (I recommend Kongregate).  Chapter 1 is very short, but 2 and 3 are fully developed games and well worth the play and I actually like the inventory/item system and combat better in Mardek.  Mardek actually seems to have more content as well.
445	-1	No Controller support for Mac OSX - does not work with PS3 game controller as many other Steam games do.  I attempted to fix this by spending $5 in the app store to use a key mapper in hopes of getting that to work, but no luck as after a search turned up some Ubisoft games are incompatible.  Come on Ubisoft It's a driving game, not a keyboard game.<br /><br />Other issue on Mac OSX is after first install you just get a white screen with audio but no video; you must go into the OSX settings Energy Saver and uncheck - Automatic Graphics Switching<br /><br />Also unable to return after purchase even though none of these issues are pre-called out on the product page before buying.
446	-1	sucks does not work freezes all the time and says error redownload done that @ leasr 20 times and still doesnt work
447	1	Work perfectly. Fast delivery
448	1	i almost did not download this cause the reviews...<br />i have a macbook air and i have the needed specs for the game<br />nothing went wrong i been playing for a few hours the whole process was easy and fine, not one single problem at all<br />just wanted to tell everyone its ok to dl this I'm so happy to have my sims again  ! and also the download took mabye 30 min
449	-1	I enjoyed some of it I only got to 4 and couldn't finish it everything is so small and pale (white)<br />these old eyes couldn't find some of the items. I did delete it although I paid for the full version.<br />If anyone knows how to enlarge or make the items your looking for more visible let me know and I will<br />download it again.
450	-1	Doesn't even know the simplest rules of chess
451	0	It has it's moments, but it just starts to get repetitive. I wish that it was as good as the first two, but that's just not the case here.
452	1	Great way to purchase membership since my bank doesn't allow foreign transactions. Membership is credited to my account just as fast as card codes and purchasing through the official website!
453	0	The graphics are great and the music is fun.  The game itself, however, I found annoying.  Finding the pieces of a zillion different things and putting them back together...just not my idea of a great game.  The movement through time is a nice touch.
454	1	This edition includes some excellent gameplay enhancements.  They have added new layers of complexity to the game without making the game bog down in details .  I especially like the addition of espionage and trade which in different ways can be used by players to catch up with more technologically advanced civs.
455	1	It is disappointing that The Secret World received such poor sales, the game really deserves better. Great story, fun gameplay, and an intuitive leveling system. The Secret World is a coupling of horror and Cthulhu psychological thriller with a lot of conspiracy thrown in for good measure. Become a member of one of three secret organizations and lend your aid to an ongoing secret war, filled with mutants, aliens, zombies, and more.
456	0	"This is a simple case of schizophrenia.  Or maybe it's more like Alien Hand Syndrome.  The two parts may be connected but they do not work well together.<br /><br />The game is wonderful.  It plays well and is tons of fun and is responsive.  The max city size is way too small, but I understand, for now.  I've read an article that says that eventually the max city size will be increased so I think the approach of starting small is acceptable...acceptable, not optimal.  I like the online play aspects and I'm fine with the way single player works.  It needs some fine tuning and graphics refinement and there are some frustrating game play issues like not being able to turn a road into an avenue without demolishing everything on that road.  If it worked like that in real life, we wouldn't have massive downtowns with huge skyscraper cities.  Instead the center of each city would be nothing but dirt roads and old buildings and the edges would be filled with avenues and skyscrapers.  Which is actually an interesting concept...I think I'll build that tonight!  Score 4 Stars for the game designers and devs. 5 stars if updates and patches come quickly.<br /><br />The game politics are atrocious.  They are disgusting and disrespectful to their own target market.  Origin is horrible.  This company doesn't respond to the negative criticism it receives because all it has to go on is their own internal statistics that show things like \\""Studies have shown that DRM systems like Origin reduce piracy by 50%.\\""  Statistically, that might be correct.  I don't know.  What I do know is they're not looking at the correct statistics or at the reality of the situation that shows that by requiring 100% online connectivity that they have automatically removed about 50% of their potential market that lives outside of urban broadband availability.  They are also not facing the fact that when a consumer buys a game with DRM, the DRM should be considered a feature and provide additional value.  Buyers should see it as a positive addition and protection to their investment.  It's hard to see any DRM like this as a value when, at a potential failure, the game is unplayable.  Worse yet, this piracy protection feature they have sold you will keep you out but NOT keep the pirates from playing.  In addition, if they have studies that they (in this case EA/Origin) have statistically shown that this kind of protection works and prevents piracy, then where does that success get passed on to the consumer?  It certainly doesn't get passed back to us in the game's list price.  1 Star.<br /><br />When companies realize that Louis C.K. was right and they can make millions off of creating a good rapport with their target market and sustaining a positive, pro-active reputation with their customers, then DRM will go away forever, they will save millions, game costs will come down, and we'll live in a happy little world of fluffy clouds and trees ala Bob Ross."
457	0	It's a very good price for a lot of games together, but i bought it for Generals Zero Hour and it's shows the same error (Technical Difficulties... You have encounter a serius error, blablabla) before the &#34;upgrade and fixes&#34;, so if you'll buy this pack and your fav game is Generals Zero Hour, don't buy it. and wait for Generals Zero Hour 2 =).
458	-1	Great game, great price but to complicated to figure out to use. Need instructions on how to unpack install files
459	-1	i ordered this for my son and the first one was already redeemed. called CS and was told to contact Microsoft. Microsoft says to contact Amazon. Amazon finally gave us a second card that was invalid. called Amazon again and they gave us the code over the phone and we put it in while on the phone and that code was already activated. I wanted my money back since this was just silly and i was told that i had to call microsoft and get a customer ID number. Microsoft didnt have a clue why i needed that ID. maybe ill get my money back in the near future.<br />save yourself the hassle and just go to the store and buy this.
460	1	The transaction is quick and easy for adding funds to the PSN wallet! The code is available immediately after payment.
461	-1	I had waited hours for my game to download and then the game wouldn't let me finish downloading it. I tried to use the activation code, but that didn't work either. I think this practically a scam because a lot of people have been having the same problem. Amazon should take this game of their website.
462	-1	takes 4 hours to recieve it go to the store it will be much faster than this its a waist of time
463	0	"Released 14 years after the original game in the series, and 4 years after SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 is considered by many to be the last proper SimCity game. The instalments that followed, SimCity Societies and SimCity (2013) are best left untouched, the former because it's just plain bad, the latter mostly because of an evil DRM scheme, bugs a-plenty and confining size limits.<br /><br />This, in short, is why I felt like reviewing SimCity 4.<br /><br />Let's start with a very quick description of what SimCity 4 is about. As a wannabe mayor, you select a virgin stretch of land and start building. Your city consists or residential areas, industrial areas, commercial areas and public services. With the exception of public services, you are not in control of which buildings are built. Instead, you delimit zones (residential, industrial or commercial) and your citizens/businesses will build on those zones, provided certain conditions are met. These conditions include access to electricity, enough jobs (for residential areas), enough workers (for industrial and commercial areas) ... When zoning, you can decide how dense the zones can be (no skyscraper on low-density zones, for example). Whether your residential areas will welcome poor or rich citizens, whether your industrial zones will be filled with high tech industries or dirty fumes-spillers, however, is not in your direct control. Rich people, for example, will not build their magnificent mansions on your residential zones if the area is polluted, or if you haven't provided easy access to education and health facilities. In contrast, you are directly responsible for laying public service buildings (like schools, police stations...) and networks (roads, water pipes...). Building those facilities costs money, both upfront (the cost of building itself) and throughout the game (monthly maintenance costs). So when building a brand new university, for instance, you must not only make sure that you have the upfront cash, but also that your monthly budget can afford the additional recurring expenses.<br /><br />Although it's perfectly possible to concentrate on a single city, you can build several in a region, and connect them. This has a number of benefits: one city can buy the other's excessive electricity, while providing garbage disposal service in return; or a city can provide jobs for the other, provided the commuting facilities between them is good enough. If that sounds like the features of SimCity(2013), the ones that Electronic Arts told you were responsible for making always-online mandatory, that's because the concept is very similar in both games. Strangely, in 2003, it worked just as well as an offline single-player experience. But I digress...<br /><br />What I've just described is only the basics: there are many additional parameters to take into account, and an exhaustive list would be too long. Suffice to cite a few of them: city ordinances, crime control, parks...<br /><br />Let's continue with what is right with SimCity 4 (Deluxe or not). And that would be its core mechanisms. The simulation itself is very solid. 99% of what happens to your city makes perfect sense. All the feedback that you get is logical. If your citizens or advisors complain about a lack of water/power/education/hospital funding/whatever, that's because your city is really lacking in those departments.<br /><br />Another very pleasant element is the interface design. Laying down your zones and special buildings is a breeze. Managing your transport network is a surprisingly hassle-free experience as well. All the game's information is never further than two or three clicks away. And what a load of useful information there is! You have access to your citizens' general opinion of your work, to your advisors' comments, to dozens of graphs and, perhaps most useful of all, to different map overlays. These will tell you at a glance where education is lacking the most in your city, where the air pollution problem is the worst, and about 15 other similar crucial data types.<br /><br />The game is also open for mods designed by the community of players. Although the official repository of mods on EA's website is now closed, other websites, most notably simtropolis.com, contain hundreds of megabytes of new buildings, textures and game tweaks.<br /><br />To complete this round of praises, the visuals are pretty realistic, giving a good illusion of a lively city. The music is also surprisingly decent, its quality a bit higher than the usual elevator-music found in other simulation games.<br /><br />Because the basics of SimCity 4 are so solid, it's really a shame to find so many flaws in all the rest, some of them real show-stoppers.<br /><br />The worst of them being the crashes. Not the car crashes, mind you. These are just signs of a congested traffic network, and you can only blame yourself for those. I'm talking of the kind of crashes that brings you back to the desktop without you hitting the \\""quit\\"" button. These happened frequently for me. So frequently that they're responsible for my decision to never touch the game again. Judging by the forums, it's a very widespread problem. Now, I get it, it's an old game that wasn't designed to run on our modern gazillion-cores processors. And you can fiddle with the launch options and force the game to only use one of two cores, and this would lessen the frequency of crashes somewhat. But even then, they remained much too frequent. And this \\""newer hardware\\"" excuse would be more convincing if Electronic Arts didn't STILL market the game. You'd think with ten years, they could have come up with some patches to accommodate our speedier computers. Alas, the tactics here seem to be \\""Take the money and run\\"" (which was much funnier as a Woody Allen movie than as an industry's motto). To make matters worse, there is no auto-save option: a crash will destroy all the progress that you've made after last hitting the \\""save\\"" button.<br/><br />A less serious but equally technical issue is poor performance. You'd think a CPU and graphic processor miles above what was available at the game's release would guarantee a smooth experience, but you'd be wrong. Scrolling makes the frame-rate drop deep into the single-digit realm. And in a busy city, even staying still doesn't prevent some short graphical stutter. It's not a big deal in all honesty, because a management game doesn't require a high frame rate to be enjoyable, but it's yet more evidence that the publisher couldn't be bothered to adapt a game it is still making a profit from.<br /><br />Not all problems are on the technical side of things. I've said above that SimCity 4 was a solid simulation. The problem is that it's also very dry. There is a severe lack of bells and whistles. It's like the developers had just the time to make a solid core design and had to ship it before adding all the nice extras one would expect. If you allow me a cooking metaphor: they've made a nice cake but forgot to put the icing. Let me tell you about some of the features that are missing or underdeveloped.<br /><br />1. Scenarios. Other instalments in the series have shipped with pre-made cities (real or imaginary) facing a variety of issues. You were invited to step into the mayor's shoes and try to improve the situation. Not so here. You can download user-made cities from unofficial community websites, but it's not the same as cities hand-crafted by the game developers.<br /><br />2. Disasters. Sure, they're here. Tornadoes, volcanoes, giant robots, you name it. Unfortunately, there is no way to let them happen at random, so they're basically meaningless. Aside from saving your game, firing up a spectacular disaster to watch what havoc it wrecks to your city, and getting back to the pre-disaster era by reloading your save, there's not much point to it. SimCity 4 doesn't let you live the life of an East coast mayor having to regularly deal with random hurricanes or that of a West coast mayor, always in fear of the next huge earthquake. The only \\""disasters\\"" that can pop up from time to time are fires and accidents at your nuclear power plant. I never had a nuclear incident, but I can tell you fires are one of the rare features that are broken in SimCity 4. Whenever a fire occurs, the game pauses, and prompts you to dispatch a fire truck from your nearest fire department station. The truck will get there WHILE THE GAME IS STILL IN PAUSE. if you have a fire station, no matter how small, no matter how distant from the fire, there is absolutely no chance that it will propagate.<br /><br />3. Research/Technology. In SimCity 3000, you could start your game in the early 20th century and new technologies, such as nuclear power plants, would unlock with time, giving the game a real sense of historical progression. Nothing of that sort here.<br /><br />4. Driving missions. The Rush Hour Expansion is included in this Deluxe version of SimCity 4. Its most important additions are focused on new options for your transportation network, including new kinds of roads and public transportation. So far, so good. Unfortunately, the expansion also brings another new feature with it, called U-Drive-It. This consists of driving missions, arcade-style, where you take control of one of the city's vehicles by using your keyboard's arrow keys in order to complete a series of fetch quests. Whoever thought that strategy gamers would enjoy playing a built-in arcade racer is obviously out of its mind. It doesn't help that so little care has been put into this: it feels like a promotional flash game. While this feature is thankfully optional, some buildings are only unlockable after completing certain missions.<br /><br />Overall, if you are lucky enough to not be impacted by the frequent crashes, you'll find SimCity 4 to be a very playable and solid city simulation. Its shortcomings, however, prevent it from reaching its full potential, making the end result too dry to warrant a frank recommendation."
464	0	It won't let me download the Jason and predator character. Is this happening with anyone else?
465	1	$14.99 after the Amazon $5.00 discount - you can't even get 1 of these great games for that price, let alone all of them.  I already have Civ IV and Civ V, but $14.00 was cheap enough for the G&K Expansion pack, plus all the add ons for Civ IV.  Throw in Stronghold, and this is one of the best deals I've ever seen.
466	1	"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre. I bought this game originally for my Xbox 360 and found it to be a very good yet buggy game. I saw that Metro was on sale so I purchased it for my gaming laptop, mainly to see how high I could get the graphics up.<br /><br />Steam- I read a lot about the complaints about it being a Steam game. Being a Steam user, I was glad to know that the CD key provided when purchasing this game would work if you were to try to activate it on Steam. In other words, if you had the disc and you used the CD key provided, you can enter that into Steam and it will count as you owning it on Steam. You never have to use the disc again, Steam updates Metro 2033 when an update is available, and Steam keeps track of game achievements and time played.<br /><br />Graphics- The graphics in this game are quite good! I turned the graphics to its highest possible settings for my laptop and the game ran smoothly and looked fantastic. Most of the time you are running through a dark metro tunnel that doesn't give the graphics the justice it deserves. Once you are on the surface of Moscow, the graphics look really good. I would compare the graphics to Skyrim or even Crysis 2. The one drawback about the graphics is the fact that human faces look somewhat blocky.Faces don't seem to be that well done but everything else does.<br /><br />Gameplay- Metro 2033 runs like most first person shooter games. The controls are easy to get used to but the game itself seems to be somewhat buggy. Once when I played, I walked up a slope to get to a building, I fell through the slope and fell infinitely down under the city. This was not supposed to happen. I had to go back to the most recent checkpoint but that wasn't that bad. NPCs in the game tend to be a little \\""stupid\\"" if you will. Enemies will run from one door to the next, backtrack, and repeat. Sometimes an enemy might not take notice that it is being shot at. There is stealth in the game, which seems to be a big part of some of the levels. I like the way that stealth works, however, being sneaky isn't that easy. Once one enemy knows where you are, all of them know. It doesn't matter if the other enemy is a couple hundred feet away and on another floor, he will just know.<br /><br />Story- I found the story of Metro 2033 quite interesting and engaging. Most of the game is just shoot this and shoot that but that is what all games really are. Towards the end of the game, the game becomes a more story driven and you question your motives in the game and wonder about some of the mysterious things you encounter throughout it. I won't spoil anything but there is a cool but difficult to get to ending of the game. Unfortunately, if you do not read about the requirements for the ending and do not do everything exactly how you are supposed to, you may never even know that such an ending was possible. I am currently reading the Metro 2033 book and it is similar to the game. The game is more action packed while the book is more story. That all makes sense. If you are interested in the book, I recommend playing the game first then reading the book. You will understand the story better.<br /><br />Difficulty- Metro 2033 has a couple different difficulties but the easiest difficulty can prove to be pretty challenging. It is easy to be overwhelmed by mutants, killed while trying to fight humans, get caught in a trap that wasn't easily spotted, or die from loss of oxygen loss. While fighting on the surface world, you need to wear a gas mask. You must change oxygen filters frequently and if you don't, you breath heavily, your mask becomes filled with condensation, making it hard to see, and you eventually die. If you take enough damage to the face, cracks and holes appear in your mask, making it easier to lose oxygen and eventually die.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good Story<br />Amazing Graphics<br />Fun and Challenging Gameplay<br />Realistic<br /><br />Cons:<br />Glitchy and Buggy<br />Sometimes A Little Too Challenging<br />Faces Look Bad<br /><br />Bottom Line- Metro 2033 is a fun but very challenging game that could have used a little more work. Though the graphics are spectacular, faces look like garbage. Gameplay is solid but too many glitches appear to make it flow perfectly. The story is quite interesting and the gameplay is pretty realistic. I would definitely recommend buying this game, especially if it is on sale like it is now."
467	1	Plays like a top down, old school GTA murder simulator.  It's a blast.  Two complaints:  the AI is too random, so the same strategy never works twice.  Not sure if this is a conscious design decision by the developers or not, although I'd assume so.  It's insanely frustrating to make it all the way through a level and have to restart because the last enemy wasn't where he was 'supposed' to be.<br /><br />Secondly the game is really glitchy.  There are definitely memory leaks that have yet to be patched.  This can be very frustrating.  I have an i5 2500k processor, 6950 2gb vidcard and 8 gigs of ram... shouldn't be having the slowdown on this relatively undemanding game that I get.<br /><br />Neither of these points should really stop you from buying, especially when you can get it on sale for around 5$.  It's a fantastic game and I can't wait to see more come from these developers.
468	-1	I have been a sim gamer since I was 11yrs old....I'm 28 now and I was devastated with the sims 4 release. I bought it giving a lot of thought into it...played for a couple hours and returned it. It took forever to build a house. The neighborhoods were awful. I'm sticking to my sims 3 were I can build pools, use the color/pattern palates and walk around an open neighborhood, freely visiting playable shops and sims!  EA took a giant step backwards!
469	-1	"Game is fun, and free to play (with \\""premium\\"" offerings) but if you put money into it BEWARE, customer service is horrible and will offer you pennies on the dollar if you have a loss due to their poor game design."
470	1	Probably the best way to do it
471	0	The games are perfectly emulated, but the menu is a little clunky. If that's not a problem, go for it!
472	1	i got my code really fast and didn't have to wake long at all. it was as simple as just emailing the code to your email although you get the code right when you buy it also.
473	1	I used it mainly for the discount upgrade option on PS4, so not tried it out so far on PS3, but if you like AC you will love this one.
474	1	I bought it from Amazon and redeemed it on my Xbox without any issues. Also, it is technically $1 less than MSRP. From this alone I can only give 5 stars as I don't have any complaints and it performed the necessary functions without issue.
475	0	decent could of been longer for the price i paid. very exciting at times but i lost interest at the end.
476	1	Downloaded on Steam (after trying XBLA demo) and have loved the updates they made to the series! I've been a fan since the 90's and hope they continue making more. If you honestly like the others at all, you should enjoy this. Metacritic has it in the mid-70's which sounds about right.<br /><br />I also have not experienced the same bugs as others have mentioned. That's typical, given all the hardware/driver differences, etc. Team17 has solid support and should get everything is working order soon for those<br /><br />Two wormy nubs up!
477	0	The game is good, but after downloading for a number of hours the game would not install through steam. Had I known this ahead of time I would have just used the product code and then downloaded through the steam client directly instead of having to download twice.
478	1	very good
479	-1	EA Is one if the worst companies in the world! I bought this game even after the whole launch failure. I guess that's my fault. Point is bought the game, had trouble getting it started after the download portion. Come to find out I wasn't the only person having the same problem. You think EA would learn. You've been warned! Don't Buy this game!!
480	0	It was free
481	0	Finally, however three stars because i was expecting more of a GTA gameplay with zombies even i know rockstar didn't make this
482	-1	looks so good a lot of detail.But lacks so much.lock ups are so bad I had to delete it right away.Am into car games wish there were more like this one that would play very well.keep looking.
483	-1	This game is a tad boring and simple.  Everyone is different so I wouldn't recommend not buying it but if you like the games with more puzzles with great hidden object scenes then this isn't the one for you.
484	1	Best subscription service out there.<br />Within the first hour of having Plus active on your account you'll get your money's worth by downloading the Instant Game Collection. Also, you can save an outrageous amount of money on game discounts.<br />Seriously: GET THIS!
485	0	An annoying thing about this game is that even when you click on an object, the game sometimes doesn't recognize that you've found it.  You have to click it just right, in the right spot--it's too persnickety.  It's a bit boring.  There's a story line, but it doesn't really engage you.  The graphics are pretty cool.  Maybe I'm just getting tired of the hidden object games, but this one just didn't do anything for me.
486	0	Game is okay, really hard to do at first and trophies are very hard to get.
487	0	[...] its really nyce if u knw hw to play it try it out really good game with some good graphics n music n sme gr8 functions in the game btter then the old versions
488	-1	On 3/18/14 I went to a site that advertised a Singer Confidence Quilter machine, Model #7469Q for $50. I clicked on purchase. It said go thru Amazon.com. The site that Amazon is affiliated with is fsllb.com. Then &#34;up comes your purchase&#34;..you just purchased a<br />$50 Playstation Store Gift Card for $50. I called Amazon on 3/19/14..&#34;Sorry, we can't help you.&#34; Lesson learned. Just thought I'd share this so others don't get scammed.
489	1	This game puts a twist on an old favorite--it's a story within a game.  I highly recommend this for all Mah Jong fans!
490	0	Bought for my son, he loves it.  Only gave 3 stars because of the difficulty in downloading the game from another site, pain in the neck.  I would not have got it if it wasn't for everyone elses comments about how to set it up.
491	1	I loved the game play and it was a much better improvement than the previous assassins creed game, but I had a lot of questions in the ending and concluded that there is going to be a brotherhood like assassin creed game that continues thee AC4 story line since there were a lot of parts that were not really clear to me
492	0	Activated it on steam but not playable in game....
493	0	I've played all the games on this system before so there was nothing new, but it kept me busy playing the old games
494	0	This was a good purchase for the price. Though, to be honest, I've had this for months and haven't touched any of the games for more than five minutes. I tried to get into homefront, and I couldn't do it. I tried to get into Stalker, and I couldn't do it. And I've yet to touch the Red Factions, Space Marines, or Metro 2033... although I have a new 1080p monitor coming in the mail, so I will probably end up playing all of these (starting with Metro!)
495	1	:)
496	1	Nice
497	1	amigos es uno de los mejores juegos, gracias a la descarga online se puede jugar en play3 y recordar de esos momentos en que el mortal kombat estaba en sus inicios. a pesar de ser una de las primeras versiones las imagenes y graficos se ven bien. lo recomiendo con seguridad.
498	0	Good strategic game reminiscent of Panzer Leader / Russian Front style board games.  Greatest challenge for most scenarios is the turn limit aspect.  In terms of re-creating the actual grand strategy of the Eastern Front, the creators missed the mark, which is odd as they seem to be obsessed with realism. Well worth the cost overall.
499	1	So far, I haven't played the first two games as I have been wanting to buy Bioshock Infinite for a while now. The graphics in the game are very good. Game play is solid and keeps you hooked. Can only carry 2 weapons so choose wisely, this ads a more realistic element. With the triple-pack being only $15, it was a bargain.
500	1	I'm a big fan of free to play mmorpg. Just when i got bored of the free download games, i saw gw2 with the price of $30. So i decided to give it a try. It turned out to be great, gameplay is so unique and I think I will continue to play it for a couple more months. Thanks for putting it on sale.
501	-1	Purchased this game early to get into the pre-release madness. Spent the entire weekend playing other games as the servers simply say &#34;Error 1017 World is full try again later&#34;. No queue, no suggestion for a server that might not be full, just an error that keeps you from logging in. At some point I may revise this review to reflect what I experience, but so far I've had the game for 5 days and haven't been able to log in a single time.<br /><br />Terrible, terrible, terrible game release.
502	-1	Download only has error reports  never worked
503	1	Good transaction. No problems with product.
504	0	I enjoyed the first Ubersoldier when it came out, however, the second one wasn't as good as the first. I won't say it was awful, just alright.
505	0	Currently giving it three stars because the download code was not working originally, I finally fixed this by signing onto another account and entering the code, a bit of a hassle, but at least it's working now! Currently downloading, and I got the Sting code from preordering so everything is good now!
506	-1	Since I was unable to download this game to my pc, I can't give it a true review, so therefore the one star, and I have not played it anywhere else.
507	0	I was disappointed to be honest but I still play it from time to time. I played the first and this is pretty much just a clone of that with more features and whatnot
508	-1	Rome Total War is a wonderful game, Barbarian Invasion created new features and it was designed before CA started to make anti-modding the top priority of the agenda. I am sure Alexander made new features and did a great job and is definitely worth buying. So why did I put in only one star? Why because when you buy it from here you get a missing dll error. Purchase from an installer that gives you the game, if you buy from here you are only purchasing half a gb lost from your computer and you get nothing. I am considering purchasing from other sources but it seems the link is just broken and Amazon needs to fix it.
509	0	This game is great,<br />though once you figure out how to run a city and industry to make money it gets rather boring.<br /><br />At that point it's a matter of simply creating a bunch of cities that meet your fancy, the biggest down side is this total BS cloud services they've got going on, when the servers get wonky you lose your progress, that's the only downside thus far, but, if you get bored of games easily, don't purchase this one. .
510	0	They are points, you use them on Xbox live. You play games then.<br /><br />And best of all, Microsoft doesn't get your private info!
511	-1	The code has already been used and i couldn't play the game. Also there is no contact number so this sucks.
512	1	I was surprised how much I liked the demo.  This is on my list to purchase in the near future.
513	-1	What can I say? We're all aware that EA is notorious for taking great games and making them trash (e.g. CoD), but they have definitely outdone themselves with this one. This has got to be the most unstable and poorly built game I have ever played. Launching from a website? Seriously? The single-player campaign is laughable, and the multiplayer experience is riddled with bugs. How can you take an established, succesful game series and make such a terrible game? All you had to do was make more maps, and perhaps play around with the classes, that was it. I'm willing to say that this is worse than 2142, which was in itself a terrible game. I never write angry reviews, but I had voice my concern of what I feel was a blatant theft of my money. Never buying from EA again.
514	-1	This will not successfully install, even though I tried running it as administrator and in various compatibility modes on a Win 7 computer and on one running XP.<br /><br />I have been able to successfully install other programs and games on my computer recently, and I have followed the most detailed help FAQ's I can find about this problem, which remind the user about running it as an administrator and in compatibility mode.<br /><br />Unless I find a way to successfully install this, I have to believe that the fault is in the software and cannot recommend it to anybody.
515	1	This is twisted metal 2.....the best of the twisted metal games...yes i have played them all.  I don't understand how people are confused.  If you have played this game you know it is great.  Controls don't work great on the vita however.
516	-1	Premium Works perfectly fine i just had to go through a bunch of cr*p to get the premium member ship.
517	0	This is interesting.  It is a farming simulator.  I like sim games and this one was okay the little bit I have played it.  My only complaint is that it needs better documentation and instruction.
518	0	I first ordered a 1600 point card online code, it worked fine. Then I ordered another one for 2400 points, online code again, and the code wasn't valid, luckily i got my money back but I'm not really pleased with that.
519	0	Have played previous tropico's and enjoyed them very much but this one not as enjoyable as the previously played ones
520	-1	Still haven't been able to access the game.  I'm ready to give up.<br />You had to make an Origin account.  I did so, and then it tells me I can have Plants vs. Zombies for free when I just bought the Online Game Code, but I can't access either one.  I give up.
521	1	Just a note - this also works with the PC version.  I have enjoyed Civ5 and this was a great addition that added fun features like religion and new civs.  I recommend it highly.
522	1	I played Anniversary and Underworld before.  They never piqued my interest and I gave up after few hours.<br /><br />I knew I would get the game when I saw some promotional videos and read an article about the storyline.  I could easily relate to the story because I am personally stuck in a certain country which I desperately want to leave.<br /><br />The new TR is absolutely amazing.  Lara Croft is very relatable and I could not put down my controller.  The graphics are on par with Crysis 3.  The battle system is a bit too simplified but holds much promise.  With future evolutions of the game, TR could become a top brand in 3rd person shooting games.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there is not enough problem-solving in the main story.  There are optional tombs that have simple puzzles, but the lack of puzzles in the main story made the game a little too linear.
523	1	Easy way to add game points so you can buy more stuff on xbox live. More expensive than card, but oh well. Got code instantly.
524	1	Great and quick present to give online!
525	0	Its a 2d motorcycle racing game.  i didnt like it because i thought it didnt have enough content.  Its just going around and doing jumps but that's my opinion.  There is 2 player same screen though.  Thats why i rated it 3.
526	1	Instant code, redeem on ps4, all ok.
527	-1	REQUIRES &#34;STEAM&#34; internet account to even install - you CANNOT OPT OUT and must install their SCAM internet system, even if you only want to play the game locally and NOT ON-LINE AT ALL.  Will be discarding, and won't buy ANY more game software from amazon because they 1.) Do not warn that this scam STEAM is required in order to install, and 2.) Once you buy the software that they did not warn you about this REQUIREMENT, they will NOT refund for return of this UNUSABLE software.<br /><br />Had HOPED to be able to play one of my long-ago favorite games.  But it seems that is a dream that is OVER.
528	0	Cannot beat level 4 of game 1---keep drowning.  Annoying as all get out.  Mastered many Sega games; this one appears to be beyond me, yet it isn't the most difficult Sega game I've played.  Have searched for &#34;cheats&#34; for helpful pointers, but cannot find any.  If games can be rented, you may want to rent, first, instead of wasting your money.  Good luck.
529	1	IF its okay to use this for laptops.? It would be compatible for laptops.? Please reply me back I wanna know it
530	0	I feel that this game just calls in Sids name, and is not too innovative.  I love all the other civilization games and this one was ok, but it could of used more work.  There are a lot better games in this category.  I also bought endless legend (also available on amazon) and enjoyed that more
531	-1	"Never buy a Ubisoft game.  After spending quite a bit of time on Assasin's Creed Revelations - which I had almost beaten - my files simply disappear off of their \\""secure\\"" servers.  I submitted a complaint, and a week after their promised 24hr response time, they told me that they have no idea what happened and I just need to start a new game.  Thanks for that.<br /><br />What does this add to the story? A lot - if the story you're caring about is the daddy issues that a side character has.  I would have rather spent my time learning the back story of one of my recruited assasins.  AC:R itself is a broken, jumpy, and tedious addition to the franchise.  The running and climbing mechanics work great, as long as you don't want to run to any place in particular.  There's an achievement for running for an extended period in the streets because anytime your character gets near a wall - any wall - he will run up it. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to be running across a roof, trying to complete YET ANOTHER repetitive, asinine task, only to have Ezio jump off a building.<br /><br />But none of that really matters if Ubisoft just deletes your saves.  The grand revelation of this story is that you will never regain the precious hours you wasted playing this game."
532	-1	Graphics are bad....The whole thing is not user friendly.....It's my last purchase of anything &#34;Trainz&#34;....Microsoft I believe has some good train simulators as alternatives
533	0	"I love these games. Very nostalgic for me. For the price, it is worth it. Some caveats...<br /><br />This is just a code so that you can login to Origin Games and download any game in this collection. There is no DVD version of this game. Download speeds are abyssmal -- I got about 150kbps.<br /><br />The two games I have downloaded and played so far are Red Alert 2 and Red Alert 3. I am running them on Windows 7 Professional 64 bit with no issues and no workarounds needed, despite having read that others have problems. The games were 2 and 15 gb each, so it took a long time to get them installed.<br /><br />Please also be aware that these games, once downloaded, are tied to the Origin website. That means an internet connection is still required to play. It also means that if you want to play with someone else, even on your own LAN, you will require two copies.<br /><br />I did buy two copies. I was able to download once, and then transfer the files to another computer to install there.<br /><br />Windows 7 does not support IPX, so Command and Conquer, Red Alert, Red Alert 1 and Red Alert 2 Network play will not work... well... at least not without a third party \\""patch\\"" that I have not tried."
534	-1	I have not played the campaign mode just yet and my review is based on the online play which is why most people buy the game. Not thrilled to say the least. The graphics are sharp on the PS4 and the movement is very fluid but that's about where it ends for me. It seems like this was another extension of MW3 which I stopped playing after about 6 weeks. Again, another Infinity Ward game where I am getting shot by folks I have not even seen yet when I turn a corner. And before anyone even says it, this is with Perks on which prevent me from being highlighted by Sat Coms, Oracles, etc. There was a bad case of lag in MW3 which stopped me from playing it and I'm seeing it again in Ghosts. Lag is going to happen on occasion. I understand that. But it shouldn't be consistent like it is with the Inifinity Ward games. I didn't see these issues with either of the Black Ops games. The only plus Ghosts has over MW3 is that the voice chat is improved. My friends no longer sound like they are talking through tin foil.<br /><br />I would return this game and exchange it for Battlefield 4 but my daughters bought it for me for Christmas and I don't want to hurt their feelings. If you're a CoD fanboy, you'll love it no matter what. Me, I am just tired of the same drivel. Buyer beware.
535	1	OK, so I never did a online game code purchase for the Wii. it was definitely an experience, but once I managed to get the code input correctly, it was great. My son, who's 8 yrs old, love the game, and one of the advantages is that the disc won't get damaged, as there is no disc. I'm pretty certain this game would be appropriate for all ages. I didn't see any issues letting my 8 yr old play.
536	0	Tropico 5 is only okay in my book. If you're coming from Tropico 4 (like me!), this one might disappoint a little bit as they got rid of some of the things that made Tropico 4 fun for me and added new things that are less fun (you have to explore the island in order to build; that's obnoxious). However, they also fixed some problems with Tropico 4 and it doesn't feel like a reskinned game.<br />It's good to pass time and comes with Steam achievements if you're into that sort of thing, though. It's a cool world builder and I like that it has missions to win.<br />Storyline is a little lame in this one, too, but you don't need to pay too much attention to it.
537	-1	This garbage does not work on windows 7<br /><br />I Wasted my $20, I  wish I can get my money back.
538	0	Just okay.
539	-1	I purchased this game after reading all the great reviews. After downloading which is always good with Amazon the game itself can install. When you attempt to run the game it crashes. I have windows 7 64 bit and tried running the program in every compatibility mode that windows 7 can and the same issue. I though maybe it was a 64 bit problem so I loaded it on my 32 bit system and the same issue. EA website suggests installing patches and after downloading them they will not install on either system. If I could give no stars I would. This game probably should not be available for download/purchase since it won't run on modern hardware and operating systems. I hope I can get a refund for this purchase as I am not happy about a non functional game being sold to me. I don't blame this on Amazon as much as EA. Games that are not compatible with the last 2 Windows operating systems should have notices letting people know that. My 2 cents.
540	-1	would not work
541	1	The story line is vivid and creative, I've never gotten bored reading the text.  I feel invested in the choices I make, and the outcomes of conversations are often changed by how you react, what crew you bring with you, and very often what pieces of equipment you've found or purchased along the way.<br /><br />Plenty of ways to play the game, too.  You can fire large volleys of lasers at your enemy, burn or suffocate the enemy crew with beam weapons that cut across multiple rooms of their ship, let your automatic droids over power the enemy without you lifting a finger, or sent in your crew for hand to hand combat and pick their ship clean of resources.<br /><br />Never let your guard down though, because the enemy will surprise you and do this to you too.  Expect to die in deep space a few time before you make it to the end.  But don't let that get you down, I had just as much fun losing as I did winning.  I have played through many times and still get caught off guard occasionally, which is a good thing, it keeps the game fresh and gives it tons of replay value.<br /><br />You can't rely on &#34;finding the instant win button,&#34; because it doesn't exist.  I prefer certain types of strategies, but the player is at the mercy of what he can find at the randomly placed stores he finds, and what is salvageable among the wreckage of the enemies he crushes.  You are often forced to change your plan of attack between each play through and adapt to what you may not have been expecting to find in deep space.<br /><br />Lots of customization among the 18 layout of the 9 ships.<br /><br />Soundtrack fit perfectly with the space theme, masterfully composed.<br /><br />10/10, Would (and have) recommend to all my friends.
542	-1	What a huge let down. I'm not saying the game itself is bad, I just didn't enjoy it personally. I was anticipating this one for a while. Bought the digital deluxe edition (or whatever it's called) and waited to check it out. I honestly played through the tutorial, played maybe 2 games (if that) and never touched it again. I'm not saying the game is bad in the least. Obviously for some it's fun but for me I just couldn't get into it.
543	-1	AWFUL... the worst yet..upgrade video card just for this..graphics are terrible...game play terrible..audio the worst.....servers lag and no dedicated servers as promised....save your money and keep playing Black Ops.....refunds should be offered to all who bought this abomination of a game
544	1	Perfect gift and you don't have a renewing membership like you would if you purchased through official website. I gave the code to my niece and she was off and running!
545	1	Comes with cool stuff, new jobs, however I wish there were more new skills like singing and magic.
546	1	This Season Pass is a great deal. Freedom Cry Was a spectacular DLC. Knowing that With one purchase I will get most future DLCs without having to buy anything else in the future keeps the game fresh and exciting.
547	-1	Terrible game.  The worst part is you do not get the downloaded media.  It always has to be installed from online from an online game repository called Steam.  You have to load other garbage software to your machine to even install and play the game.  I paid for the game I deserve to have the media.
548	-1	So far, unable to play this game. From the git go, it says error must reinstall origin file? I've redownloaded 3 times and unable to get it to run?
549	0	I thought to find no silly jumps with heavy armor and weapons in this game but keep doing, need to change that
550	-1	I agree with the previous two reviews by Old School and Icejon.  My biggest complaint is that the game is no longer turn-based when it comes to the the combat sequence. It is now a real-time game where you have to hit the spacebar to pause the action and give your mercenaries orders. Gone are the action points.  Other issues that I take umbrage with are:  1) Much of the management that made the JA2 series fun is gone. Tasks are non-existent except in real-time. Moreover, what is even the point of having a time clock if all of the mercenaries remain permanently hired? Why have different speeds of time?  2) The player inventory has changed as well. There is no place to store keys or money. Can we forge weapons? As far as I can tell - no. Even more annoyingly, the mercenaries cannot drink liquor!!!!  3) The player is not allowed to create their own personalized character.  5) It is difficult if not impossible to switch between the world map and the location map where your mercenaries are positioned unless you move them to another location. Even then, to get into a location map your mercenaries must run into some of Diedriana's men. You cannot simply go back and forth between the two map interfaces.  6) One can buy all of the weapons they want from Bobby Ray's. It is unclear how one gets them from the Drassen Airport once they are sent.  7) The world map of Aruclo is much smaller and the game has the same premises as JA2 - take out Diedriana.  8) In the location map, there is a small map showing the detail of the location and who is in the area. It would have been nice to be able to actually use this map to move to different characters and locations. Currently it is worthless.  9) If the mercenaries move and then bump into each other, they stay in suck in postion until you move them individually. What it looks like is a bunch of kids playing shove. The reason why this point is significant is becuase the mercenaries bunch up and this is a real-time game where there is notime to correct bunching up  The greatest improvement is, of course, the graphics. They well should be considering the lapse between the JA2 series and this new version of Back in Action. However, if you are a real fan of the series, you will already be aware of the game titled Jagged Edge which has equally as good graphics and is closer to JA2 than this version of Back in Action. Jagged Edge also provides an easier method to manipulate the camera. Back in Action's camera controls are fiddley.  One must ask: did the developers/designers ever play JA2? Did they appreciate the game as it was? Why fix something when it is not broke? If anything they should have produced the graphics and a new story while improving the mechanics - not remaking the same game with completely new mechanics. This should have been sorted out in the Beta version.  In summary, if you liked the old JA2 series, you will probably have issues with Back in Action. To me this new version is a disappointment. Good luck with hitting the spacebar on time!
551	1	To be honest, when I first received this game I played it for about a week and didn't like it. I played intermittently for about 10 months before I stopped altogether. It was only about four days ago I picked it up and decided to get my $30 Black Friday money out of it.<br />  After downloading some updates for 15 minutes, the game finally launched. I played it again and was wowed.<br />First off, this game is pretty much the polar opposite of Civilization IV. The gameplay is slower and less intense. Stuff takes longer to build, and cities take forever to develop and capture in war. City states can be a real pain if you try to take more than one. They'll band up against you and be harder to convert to allies.<br />All that behind, the rest of the game is actually pretty good. I particularly like the combat system. In IV, a stack of doom could randomly invade your territory and take 6 cities. V's one unit per tile is pretty genius I think. It gives weaker civilizations (although not too weak) a better chance at defending themselves. In my case I settled a city near Napoleon. He at first took it well, kept friendly relations, and then politely tried to invade it. The territory I had settled was far off from my mainland (no advanced resources in my old spot). Sending backup units was out of the question. Thankfully I had enough gold to buy a horde of units to defend Atlanta. In Civ5, your economy is everything. Be sure to build plenty of trade posts and use Commerce and Rationalism to boost their output. During a land war be sure to build plenty of naval units to bombard enemy units and also sink them at sea. Also, beware letting any solo units stray near an enemy city during warfare. It will get the living daylight bombarded out of it by the city.<br />Diplomacy is relatively weak. Empires are very bipolar. They'll have friendly status with you for all of history and then suddenly declare war on you for no reason. Unlike Civ4 you can't tell what makes a Civ like you or dislike you. This only adds to the uncertainty of diplomacy. Research agreements are pretty beneficial if you have the spare money. Be cautious though, for if you declare war on someone you have a research agreement with before it's complete, you won't get a full refund.<br />One thing I would like to see in diplomacy is the ability to maintain a national debt.<br /><br />Overall, I think Civ5 is pretty good. Some things could use work, like the diplomacy or even financial part. However, I haven't played Gods and Kings yet so I can't really be sure if they've fixed that.<br />Have fun with Civ5.
552	1	Effective & trustworthy. Need I say more?
553	1	Very good deal for the price. I got full call of duty advanced warfare game,season pass,bal-27 AE & atlas 45 pistol AE,EM1 quantum (laser rifle),Crossbow(unlocks at lvl 48), Ak-12 G,Atlas exo suit and helmet, brass exo suit, atlas gorge map, atlas calling card,5 supply drops (gives random gear/weapons),atlas emblem (for your calling card) all for $99 dollars.my brother bought cod aw and season pass and it was $130
554	1	What can I say, it's Xbox Live. If you have an Xbox, and don't have Xbox Live, what are you thinking? Stop reading this and buy Xbox Live!
555	0	The game is all right. It was a bit slow to load, although that might just be my computer. The game's premise was interesting, the cut scenes were all right, and the weapons were definitely interesting. The controls bothered me a bit, as shifting between weapons or toggling between enemies mid-fight was a little difficult, and focusing on the wrong enemy was a bit too easy--for example, when I needed to focus on a bolterfly right behind Alice and instead the focus got stuck on a different enemy. However, my real issue was not with the controls. It was with the difficulty of gameplay.<br />The fight scenes were easy enough, and interesting. Some of the jumps and more technical things, however, took me longer than the fights. Several of the jumps took me so long that by the time I got through them, or didn't make them for the fifteenth time, I simply quit because I was so frustrated by the jumps.<br />All in all, the graphics are decent, and the game itself is interesting and fun. However, the controls and jumps could have used a little work.
556	-1	Again we have fallen into the trap of online DRM not allowing us to play a single player game we pre-purchased with hope in our harts. EA has taken up too much of my time and money and I'll not be duped into paying for their, or any other company that follows their route's, games.
557	0	It's OK, not timed, no 'steam' registered requirement.  Relaxing, just not very complex.
558	1	if you enjoy watching people grab their own crotch, starting as a loser and becoming a god, and the 80s/early 90s. Then this game is the only game for you.
559	1	Super fast and easy
560	0	This game is alright but not up to traditional Diner Dash games that I have played. Garden Dash is a little difficult but that is the fun of it. I would recommend playing this game for those who love time management genre games but if your just starting out this game is not the best of this class.
561	-1	this code doesn't work
562	0	Its okay.
563	1	Great character for a great game.
564	1	Just don't like the Backwater map.  Other than that, it's great.
565	-1	was not clear that to use you must download and install two other programs (steam, windows live) and keep track of long keys to verify.
566	-1	I hate this game. It was made in the spirit of Portal and the idea is ingenious, but the execution is terrible. The puzzles are moderately hard to figure out, but very difficult to actually solve. Almost every puzzle boils down to some kind of jumping puzzle, the worst kind of 1st person video game. A bunch of the puzzles require mid-jump shift between dimensions, which is really hard for me to do. You can have a puzzle solved, but fall a dozen times before getting it right. I deeply dislike this game.
567	0	It's a good solid game (especially for the price).  The gameplay isn't too challenging but there will be points in the game where you may have to re-try a level a couple of times to move on.  It's entertaining and fun.  I recommend the game to anyone between the ages of 6 and 100.
568	1	Totally Awesome...
569	-1	Simply horrible!!!  It is an inexpensive game, at least, but I fail to see the enjoyment in it, which is the point I would think...
570	0	I went into this purchase knowing that Dark Souls was considered one of the most difficult (and rewarding?) games ever made.  If you don't want to spend 80% of your gameplay dying - don't get this game.<br /><br />Also, the graphics leave much to be desired.  I have a 460 GTX GPU and even at the highest settings it feels like I am playing a PS2 game in 480p.  I have tried to come back to this game and give it more time, but I just can't stand being angry when I play a game like this.<br /><br />This is NOT for the faint of heart.
571	0	good
572	0	It's a good game, with good physics and graphics. Also, the sounds are very alike to the originals, but... playing this with keyboard is not an easy task! The progression of the game is not that &#34;rewarding&#34;, and you will be frustrated quickly.<br />In the end, is a good bargain if you like motorsport and racing. Also, is a good bargain if you like simulators and Ferrari. But if you like to play just for fun, you will encounter a hard to play game.
573	1	Pays for it self. Enough said. Buy now, you won't be disappointed trust me. Enjoy and add me. Killinmonk .
574	1	Not only is this game excellent and innovative, but it's extremely fast to load on my moderate laptop.<br /><br />Gameplay-wise, my only gripe is that this is the kind of game that, once you master a technique, you get more abilities thrown at you, rather than just more intricate puzzles. I'd prefer an increase in map difficulty over an increase in play complexity, but it's a VERY minor nit in an otherwise extremely well written game.<br /><br />I activated this game on Steam, and have no complaints about their use of the service. Unlike some games on Amazon that activate on Steam for multiple platforms, this one is as-advertised, a Windows-only game (not shocking, being a Microsoft Studios game).
575	1	quick cash
576	-1	It's ok nothing to stop what your doing and jump into it.  the WW1 weapons are ok at stopping or slowing them done. But ammo is a premium havent looked around much  still trying it out
577	0	This game took about three hours to play.  I enjoyed the concept of the game (CSI style investigation) and the story of the unsolved murder was interesting.  However, the mini-games were really simple and the hidden object scenes were very repetitive.  They used many of the same locations over and over -- so much that I knew where more than half the hidden objects were right off the bat by the end of the game.  It's a good game for a beginner, but seasoned HOG fans will be bored and want more of a challenge.  Some of the scenes are a little graphic and it's probably not appropriate for pre-teens.
578	0	Considering that I never play this game... it's okay. Just lost interest in it. Same old same old crap over and over again. Loot, loot, and loot again. Zzz Zzz Zzz. Play League of Legends instead.
579	1	While this is a conventional adventure game with puzzles and a point and click interface, the commentary Nina provides is hilarious at times regarding wrong choices.  I just hope another chapter is created by the game producers.
580	0	The Good:<br /><br />- Great deal on PS4 games when purchasing at a bundle<br />- Flower will unlock on the PS3, PS Vita, and PS4<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- I am not into Indie Games as much so I lost interest quickly<br />- Be careful when purchasing through Amazon I had to sign out of my username account and then sign back in after the games downloaded because they did not unlock properly even after entering the code given by Amazon<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />If you're into indie games this bundle is for you. Otherwise I would suggest waiting for another bundle to come along.
581	-1	This was part of a scam
582	1	Purchased for grandson and once he got the code right it worked for him just fine.
583	-1	"BF3 is a fairly good game, but definitely could use a better overall sense. I played on its Hard settings, which means you get killed really easy and then have to do that section over (and over and over)-listening to the same stupid dialog-over and over. Why can't I change the difficulty setting without starting the game completely over??? And why is there an infinite spawn of enemies unless you play the way they want you to? The game lacks some really personal fighting-it seems like the problems with the game are such that I can't get really into it. CoD MW didn't have those problems-I could just play and play. And then there is the BSDRM... Origin. What a FPITA! Origin is stupid at its worst! Starting with the game's installation. I \\""downloaded\\"" the entire game, then there is a 4(!) GB update??? 4 GBs??? Then there is ANOTHER update: 1.5 GBs! Are you kidding me??? And, naturally, starting BF3 takes you to an Origin site so you can buy their stuff... Screw that!<br /><br />On the other hand, the environment is amazing; my card (AMD 5870) can't play at Ultra. But it still looks great.<br /><br />I will steer clear of anything to do with Origin in the future. Seriously, Origin has its head so far up its....."
584	0	The storyline wasn't very good, it was very tedious and repetitive. They needed to put a little more into the plot.  It was OK for a HOG though, having GREAT puzzles that I have never seen before, which is unusal because I've done quite a few puzzles. The end came all too suddenly making the game pretty short; on it's behalf though my sister after playing it all the way through started it right back up and decided to play it again.
585	0	I got it for free during a promo and installed it but couldn't get online to work.
586	0	It's great at first but then you come to a point when you hve to re-do things. you can't continue cause there is no more room.  I'd pass
587	0	Got this for Space Marine, and it works fine, albeit with the wasd mouse controls.  lots of value, looking forward to obscure fpss like metro and stalker.  also reading the bible, war and peace, raising children, and ritual goat slaughter.
588	0	Good variety of puzzles from hard to easy.
589	0	good
590	1	So.  Much.  Fun!
591	0	You get the base game and the Season Pass. Supposedly, the Season Pass is supposed to come with all current DLCs and future DLCs, right? Nope! Not with this one. You don't get every single DLCs, which ruins the purpose of a Season Pass. I'd highly recommend everyone to stay away from these greedy developers on not making their fanbase happy when it comes to extra content.
592	0	Pros:  Big world, good graphics (if your machine can handle it), voice acting<br />Cons:  Currently plays like a beta game, bad lag spikes, sloppy combat system.<br />Conclusion:  ESO has the potential of being great, but it really feels like it was rushed.  Keep playing WoW for another year or so and let ESO improve.
593	0	It's an ok game, but nothing challenging. I lost interest pretty quick. On the other hand my 7 yr old Grandaughter likes it.
594	1	Does what is says, need I say more!
595	-1	Badly designed game compared to others of the same genre. I couldn't recommend this game to anyone before choosing others first.
596	-1	Crashes so often you can't finish a campaign; in fact,it crashes upon starting and then crashes at the end of every mission!runs choppy,full of bugs.As for the game play.......it's lame.Interface is difficult to manage,graphics are sub par,unstable.I'm running a smokin'hot Alienware quad core,it ain't my machine,this game is just weak!My advice is don't bother,save your money,save yourself the grief.I'm a little pissed with Amazon.
597	0	For starters, the download version came with a virus. It almost shut my computer down, but after doing a restore it was fine. I finally got the game to work but it has no sound. Other than that, it's a pretty-good game. It does get boring after you play for awhile, but I guess most games do. I would recommend this game, just be careful if you buy the download.
598	-1	So here's how this will play out if you do buy this garbage... you'll get a steam code... you'll verify through steam... you'll download the game and install it. Once you launch it for the first time, you will be told you need to create a Games for Windows Live account.... so you create one. Then it asks for the product key, supplied by Steam. When entered, it says invalid. Great! So then you go on the Games for Windows Live website and redeem the code online. It will show that you registered GTA IV PC. Success!!!... so you think. WRONG. The game will still not be able to be activated. Here's the reason why: It will register the game as an XBOX 360 game. Yup, if you go to the purchase history at [...] it will show your game listed under XBOX 360 and not under PC. So then you'll have to call 877-274-4349 to talk to support at Microsoft to have them fix it. It'll take 3-5 business days with possible extra delays since they just released XBOX One and it's Thanksgiving weekend. So I'll probably not get this fixed for a couple weeks. Also, I purchased two copies of the game so I could play with a friend and both were registered on two separate computers one two separate Live accounts, and both were listed under XBOX 360 so they are having to fix both. If I could go back, I'd simply go to the store and buy the damn hard copy for probably close to $10 and actually play it today and not weeks from now. Worst Amazon purchase I've made yet.
599	0	this game has a good story, good items but the saving system is too bad.. if you died in the middle of the mission and you collect so many stuff you will have to start all over.. the intent of any game is to have fun and not demoralized the gamer...i think the saving feature needs to be fixed quick before continue same for far cry 4.
600	1	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood was probably the high point of the Desmond saga but this one was still good fun for the money.
601	0	not enough details
602	-1	I bought it just before my computer crashed. Never got a chance to use it. When I got my new computer it had windows 8. This program is not compatible. Not happy.
603	1	awesome! absolutely love it! best purchase i have made. price was great for my budget. already recommended to my family and friends.
604	1	Great game! Awesome for co-op!
605	1	Great game! I have a mac mini and the processing speed is great!. I hope more updates come out soon.
606	-1	This game was not worth the .99 cents I paid for it.  After playing 2 minutes of this game I feel the developer owes me money for my pain and suffering.
607	0	just wish it was the whole thing cuzz now im jhonesen for all of the access i dont have. hoping to get it in my stalking.
608	1	Love Origins.
609	0	The installer only works on Windows so you will not be able to run it on another platform with third party tools. The game is not what I expected in relation to Red Alert 1 and 2. They try to force co-op on you, or you have to play with an idiotic AI ally. EA ruined this franchise in my opinion. It's just mediocre.
610	-1	I don't feel like writing a long review I just want to warn people that enslaved (through no fault of amazon's) doesn't work properly. I had very intense fps issues (less than 1 fps) that caused it to be unplayable despite the fact that my computer far exceeds all system requirements.
611	1	Game gets 5 stars but on my Windows 8 laptop it doesn't always work right. Shuts down so lots of lost progress at times.
612	0	"I love the old Lucas Arts adventure games, like Monkey Island, and I was looking for something similar.  The Cave is not like the old adventure games, in that the player does not pick objects and decide how to interact with them (ex: open, talk to, pick up, give, etc.)  However, the game is imaginative and contains entertaining puzzles.  Also, each character has their own dark history that slowly unfolds as you play.  Because parts of the game only accessible by certain characters and only three can be played at a time, there is potential for many hours of gameplay.<br /><br />The game is not without bugs.  I was on the second to last level of the game when I began having trouble moving an object.  My character kept walking forward and dropping the object when I just wanted it to grab the object and walk backwards.  I learned how to get out of that trap, but then one of my characters fell through the floor and vanished.  I cannot retrieve him and I must have three characters to leave the level.  The game auto-saves and there is not an easy way to go to earlier saves (you have play programmer to do that).  So, in my case I have to start over from level one, which is highly disappointing.<br /><br />So, buy this game at your own risk.  It IS fun and it seems that other people have made it to the end without any trouble.  At the same time it is a newly released game and it might be better to buy it after it has been \\""out there\\"" a while so the bugs can be worked out."
613	-1	not what I thought it would be! I do not understand how to get started. I was looking for actual playing baseball as a player
614	1	Nice muy bien
615	-1	Very mediocre.
616	-1	The game was unplayable during any time when someone else in your timezone was awake, and while we were looking forward to this game the online DRM just made it completely unplayable.  There's no reason for a SIM game to be fully online (only Facebook games can do this it seems).  EA successfully made a more advance more expensive version of a Zynga game while at the same time one upping them by making it unplayable at the launch.<br /><br />They knew about this during the beta, and didn't care or do anything about it.  It reaffirms why I nor anyone I know if I can help it will ever hand money over for another EA product.
617	-1	Never again will I buy boost from amazon. EA has ruined the pack that once existed here. The take away content, essentially raise prices and cant even keep the stability of their servers a priority. No thanks.
618	1	Easy , secure and fast
619	1	Great Product
620	0	I love pinball, tho only time will see how good i get at it! Takes me back to the times of my youth, when i put in those quarters!
621	0	First of all, still love the game.  I love that it is &#34;turn based&#34; so you can answer the door, do laundry without dying.  But in the final battle it does love to disconnect.  Maybe the last battle has too many cut-aways or something.  Overall, still like it, and will probably get the expansion, but gosh I thought crashing games was a thing of the past,
622	1	This game is so much fun. I get into the mood to just relax and play a long game sometimes. It can get a little dry if you're just driving for hours, but you can put your own internet radio stations on along with the preloaded european radio stations. There are a ton of mods available for truck names, physics, snow, the list goes on. I definitely suggest using a racing wheel or some sort of analog controller. Using the keyboard alone makes it a little difficult to make turns effectively.<br /><br />Buy it for sure if you like to relax and build a trucking empire.
623	0	I don't like it coz without the patch it doesn't run smoothly for me. I wanted to buy the patch from amazon but it seems you don't have it
624	1	This game is a fairly simple match 3.  Bonus is you get to spookify your house!<br /><br />Great time waster when you are tired and not up to a terribly challenging game!
625	0	I have not really used it much.  It is different from Jewel Quest II and III.  However, I found it to be okay so far.
626	1	This game, at first glance, seemed like it had little to offer. You drive a truck. What fun...<br /><br />But, after playing it for over 40 hours, I have come to quite enjoy the game. It isn't stressful or aggravating; you just drive a truck from point A to B.<br /><br />There is a economic side to it, offering the ability to purchase new trucks, upgrade existing trucks, hire new drivers, and repair damage either from inevitable wear or a clumsy turn in your last trip. There is a progression system for both you and the AI drivers you hire: you can select an upgrade to your character (and to the AI drivers by pre-setting his/her priorities) to improve various economically related aspects of the game, but also to open new possibilities, such as a single drive from the UK to Italy (long distance) and several upgrades offering new cargo types.<br /><br />Time is accelerated and the roads equivalently shortened, so a dedicated 30-hour haul takes only around one to two hours real time.<br /><br />Not many bugs or glitches in the game that I have encountered. I've seen some major bugs posted online, but they are intentionally carried out and can actually be quite difficult to do (one involved driving up stairs to fall out of the map, and another involved modifying the game files to ram traffic at insane speeds to fly over barriers and out of the map). Unless you actively search for and carry out glitches with the intent to do so, you shouldn't find any here.<br /><br />A very good game overall. As with any game, words can never quite describe it, so I would suggest watching some game play videos online and trying out the game's demo (go to the developer's website to download it) and see what you think. If you need constantly changing, fast-paced game play, this game probably won't appeal to you. If you enjoy simulations, casual games, and/or would like something to settle down with for a few hours (or even 10 minutes; the game saves upon exit regardless of where or what you were doing in-game!), then this game will most likely be one of your favorites.
627	1	The item was found through slickdeals and I wanted to use the code on STEAM a game managing software for PC. (DVD's are obsolete to me).<br /><br />I received the code, punched it via steam to activate it and it worked perfect!<br /><br />I would recommend it if that's what you want =).
628	1	I like this game a lot. It has tons of new options and clothe and the like, but the game made my other games really buggy. I really wish they would fix a lot of things about it.
629	0	I've only played the free version so far but this game has some cute graphics and is pretty fun.  I may buy it if I can't find something better along the same lines.
630	1	Great sniper Game. Great graphics. AI is a little off enemy pointing in different direction than you are but still shooting at you. The parts where you play as a combat soldier using a machine gun can be confusing and hard to do but still fun. Great game overall.
631	-1	So after buying this game I installed it on both of my computers, my Desktop and my Laptop. Then I had to switch out my graphics card thanks to a blown cap, and had to put in an older card lying around instead, until I bought a new one.  I get my new card, put it in, and then try to play this game. Apparently, I USED UP MY 3 ACTIVATIONS FOR THIS GAME EVEN THOUGH I ONLY USED IT ON TWO COMPUTERS.  This means that if I wanted to continue playing this game, I'd have to put in the old card I was using temporarily, that won't even run a lot of other games I play.  Thanks Ubisoft, You're idiotic policy, just lost you a customer because I will never be buying any of your products ever again! Hope it was worth it.
632	0	its the only way to turn an amazon gift card balance into psn balance, so i had to pay the premiun, sigh
633	-1	so this game wont even start don't wast your money i don't understand how the others got it to start it downloaded fine and set up fine but once it starts i get a back screen with an fable mouse causer that's all. searched the internet foe answers several people are having the same problem with the PC version . and to top all that off i played the x box version of this at a friends and it sucked compared the the first and second one.
634	-1	I have a 2011 MacBook Pro with 10.75 OS and the game does not run at all. The graphics card is insufficient. Don't waste your money.
635	-1	I was disappointed because this version of Hoyle Card Games did not give me as many choices as the old one<br />I had. For instance, there were fewer choices of people(cartoon people) to play with. There were no solitaire<br />games included  either.
636	1	My granddaughter loves this game.  She plays it all the time; I have to make her stop.
637	-1	I can't really review when I can't play the game.  Playstation store is not online so I can download the game.
638	1	i bought this online and downloaded it because i was tired of steam blocking my updates for play online, and i havnt looked back and im enjoying the mmo that i use to play long ago
639	1	Exactly what it says it is. I received the code in my email inbox within a matter of minutes and was able to use it instantly.
640	1	Thank you Amazon for having these online so, I do not have to make a trip to the store to get a card!
641	1	This game is an engaging strategy RPG that almost ties Fire Emblem in quality. It is very similar to Fire Emblem Gaiden;it has explorable villages and a functional world map (the second battle even takes place on the world map!)<br />When you take a look at the details, it's all about what you like in a strategy RPG. If you like versatility and gameplay depth, Fire Emblem is the best choice for you. If you like turn-based RPGs (Final Fantasy,etc.) and also enjoy more fantasy-based settings, Shining Force is the game you want.<br /><br />Pros-<br />-Interesting turn system<br />-Cool battle animations<br />-Fantasy setting is amazing<br />-Sega Genesis Classics client is super convenient and allows saving at any time<br />-Low price and short download time<br /><br />Cons-<br />-Soundtrack is more dull and repetitive than Fire Emblem (I expected this from a strategy RPG, though.)<br />-Turn system can be confusing at times
642	-1	I've downloaded this game three times, and where Im at it takes a day and a half. All three times it gets to the same point and errors out. I'm glad Im not out too much money because this was a total waste of it.
643	-1	Purchased this game years ago, and it worked well. Upgraded computer to Windows 7, and it wouldn't open. The computer started to flag it as a high threat virus. Maybe it's me and my computer (which is rather new), but FYI.
644	1	I downloaded this because it was free, and I can never resist free!  But I was quickly impressed with how much fun it is and how addicting!  I couldn't stop playing until I beat it, then unlocked the bonus boards, and couldn't stop until I beat them too!  And I still play it when I'm bored.  It's a lot of fun and increases in difficulty as you progress, but without getting too hard to beat for people like me.  I like a challenge but I find a lot of console games are too hard for me to beat.
645	0	who ruin it with their hacking stuff<br />.<br />I stop play against other players<br />back in Medal of Honor first version<br />because I can guarantee in all shooter video games<br />there is always someone who is cheating<br />and it doesn't matter if the game is running an anti cheat program<br />so if Ghost Recon Future Soldier multiplayer mode is basically dead<br />you can say thanks to all dishonest people who destroy it<br />.<br />however I enjoy Ghost recon future solider in coop mode mission<br />if you don't care about the multiplayer part of this game go ahead buy it
646	1	I LOVE this game! The Banner Saga has made its way into my top ranks of favorite games. Not only is it visually stunning (like a living and breathing storybook) but the storyline keeps you so incredibly enthralled the entire time. It is a turn-based fighting game, but I would say that the majority of the gameplay is decision making and advancing the plot through dialogue. I was so incredibly attached to the characters and I hated to see it end (hopefully there will be a sequel, because it sets up for one). I would highly recommend this game!
647	-1	All I wanted to do was play one of my childhood's favorite games, but it every time I try to play it crashes my computer and I have to hard reboot my system.<br /><br />My computer has the specs in order to run the game so it is clearly not a problem on my end. There are a lot of people that have the exact same problem as me and have posted on the EA forums asking for help, but not a single representative has addressed the issue.<br /><br />I've spent hours trying to get this game to work and I didn't even get a chance to play for a second. Who knows what kind of damage all of these hard reboots have done to my computer.
648	0	Although Blades of Time never offers anything innovative to the hack n' slash genre and puzzles become tedious as they are too easy, the overall visuals and backdrops look outstanding, the combat a rewarding experience without much complexity and the use of time a neat feature, little more do you need to enjoy this game.
649	-1	Never got the Download key to work, I had to go out to PS and buy it from them, so I wound up paying for it twice.<br />If I could give less than 1 star I would.
650	0	Everything was good ... Except onething ( when you place thecorder foe purchasing the code.. It takes 5 hours to be generated ! )<br /><br />We are in 2014 , and you've got the most powerful secure server in the hole world.<br /><br />Anyway 5 stars for amazon<br />And 3 stars for the codes payment procedure.
651	0	Not bad for the price
652	0	Fun game for the time, but after a certain time it becomes unenjoyable.
653	-1	Was a very boring game.  Would not recommend for those who like mystery or a theme to a hidden object game.
654	-1	Beware the viruses and/or spyware that likely comes with your download.  This &#34;game&#34; was released on several other sites and pulled when malware was discovered.
655	-1	had to get a refund for this game. could not download it. I had to contact amazon to let them know the game would not download or instal.
656	0	For $3.00 and a quick game for kids, I can't complain.<br /><br />If you don't mind mild graphics and the unrealistic world
657	1	This was the lowest I could find for this renewal and the previous renewals were only $39.00. I think it should remain that price as costs associated with this isn't much.
658	-1	I liked the potential of this game and I was super excited about it for at least a year leading up to the release. I signed up for the beta and was really excited to see some of the features during that.<br /><br />I've stuck through it with all the issues, however I stopped playing it about a month ago and honestly I don't really miss it. I never got to build an arcology, and when I was actually playing a region with my friend, there were so many problems that we had to keep starting new cities and eventually abandon the region. Playing with another person is ok, but if you create all the cities yourself, you can be sure that you assign extra police and fire trucks to your city etc instead of waiting for them to build up etc. As well, if the person you are playing with is doing  poor job of their city and it ends up as a crime haven, then that affects your city so badly - to the point in one case where my ratings were so bad for crime becuase 98% of the crime was coming from the neighboring city. My friend had stopped playing the game, so I was stuck with his crappy city causing endless problems in my city.<br />They released this game too soon. I was a beta tester, and it was rubbish how much time they gave you to play, had they been a bit more generous with the beta, they would have found many of these issues before the release, not that the would have had time to fix them probably.<br />The free game was a joke as well - most of the choices of the free game were shooters or driving games - sorry but the your target audience who play sim city, are people who like building, strategy and sim games - and there wa nothing in the list that appealed to me.<br />Also, the constant updates and downloads are so frustrating. And then I tend to lose connection to the game servers which loses progress on my citys - the whole &#34;always online&#34; thing is just so counter productive and makes the game play stilted where it should be seamless. I really feel this feature madea hugely negative difference to my experience - it's also an excuse for the developers to not put out a complete game as they can just push out updates as often as they like. But just becuase you can, doens't mean you should!<br /><br />All in all, very dissappointing, overpriced for what you got and choices by the developers and publishers have turned what should have been a fabulous revelation into a giant impotent and many tentacled mess of a game.
659	-1	Found out after I bought this item, you need to down load &#34;amazondownloader&#34;.  My computer told me that my computer could be at risk.  I don't understand why I need an &#34;amazon downloader&#34; when windows 7 does it fine.  Just wasted $6.99 for a program that I will NEVER download.  Thanks Amazon.
660	-1	let me very fair. this game is the only game that was overheating my 1 year old pc and 1 year old amd radeon hd 7xxx video card. i didn't like this issue.this is my main dislike. i am still waiting for a wildstar amd optimization patch. but my free trial is over. i don't know if the content is good or not. the game is a big question mark.
661	-1	I love what the game brought to my game, but I can't even play the island! It glitches, and other people seem to be having the same problem.
662	1	I got an amazing deal on this card- so amazing I was skeptical it would work but it did!!!great deal!
663	-1	don't everybody's  Xbox 360  card he doesn't work.  find a physical card  don't because it's horrible. just don't. bed code
664	-1	Do not buy this code, I got a non-working code and you have to go through Sony's AWFUL support to get a new one.
665	0	The story, combat and general mechanics were in my opinion a step backwards from the excellence of Dragon Age Origins.
666	0	Should've been great. This game, when it works, is so much fun. However, most of the time its buggy, glitchy, broken, whatever you want to call it. The fact that you have to pay an additional $50 on top of the $59 to get the entire online package is an unbelievable tactic that game industry companies continue to get away. Thanks to all the dumbies who pay for it, like myself.Be better than me, dont buy this. So far the maps are okay.
667	1	my little brother loved it, worked really great on his laptop along with my other sisters as well, will consider purchasing more!
668	-1	"Pre-ordered and was one of the lucky ones that was able to download and install the game.<br /><br />Was able to play for two hours on Tuesday night (Wednesday morning) between 1AM EST and 3AM EST.<br /><br />Game has been unplayable since that point due to \\""server issues.\\"""
669	0	Not one of the best FPS out there but definitely a great game for the avg FPS player such as myself.
670	0	didnt work
671	1	Borderlands 2 is an amazing game.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have had many hours of fun.
672	-1	I purchased once but the code didn't work so I called customer service he was really nice, he gave me a new code but it didn't work again though he did ask if he could stay on the phone to make sure but I didn't have the time to. In the end I gave up
673	0	Not a bad game. It plays rather well, especially for a PC version, but I still prefer NBA Live. To me, Live appears to be more versatile, more realistic. Just my opinion.
674	-1	This was a waste of my money.  As soon as I downloaded it I received a message that this program contained a virus and it was not allowed to run.
675	0	$2.49 for 6 Crusader Kings 2 DLCs  (when on sale and using the $5 credit)<br /><br />Note the Crusader Kings 2 base game NOT included.  You can get that individually or in the Plentiful Paradox Package:<br />[[ASIN:B008G0ZDZI Plentiful Paradox Package [Download]]] (The $5 credit worked there too.)<br /><br />If you're interested in the Majesty series and the Warlock game, get the Paradox Majesty Franchise, which is much more complete:<br />[[ASIN:B00AAHSFAK Paradox Majesty Franchise [Download]]] (The $5 credit worked there too.)<br /><br />So get this bundle only if you're interested in the Crusader Kings 2 DLC's; otherwise, I recommend the Paradox Majesty Franchise linked above for the thorough experience in Majesty's fantasy world of Ardania.<br /><br />UPDATE:  the complete Crusader Kings Pack can be found here:<br />[[ASIN:B00B7UK2I2 Crusader Kings Pack [Download]]]  ($5 credit worked there too)<br />So, if you're looking to get that game, just get THAT bundle instead of getting all the parts separately.
676	0	This review contains spoilers of DS3 and its DLC.<br /><br />I really liked this DLC, but there are a few issues with it. First, it is quite short: about an hour to an hour and a half. Somehow, it seems hard to justifying paying a quarter of the price of the full game while you get maybe a tenth (or less) of the gameplay time.<br /><br />While I liked Dead Space 3, I found the general fear and horror to be greatly decreased from the previous games. Awakened definitely adds those horror elements back: hallucinations, live amputations, and baskets of body parts, just to name a few. The plot of the game itself is good, and especially for those who didn't play co-op missions, it's nice to see more interaction between Isaac and Carver.<br /><br />If you don't play it on New Game+, it is very difficult: you're left with very little to craft a good weapon, and the enemies are quite tough. On New Game+ or with the Devil Horns, it's pretty easy (but that's true of all of Dead Space 3). But considering that Dead Space 3 ends with the apparent deaths of Carver and Clarke, it seems confusing to bring them back to life (and then end the DLC with their apparent deaths again). At the time of this review, there are no plans to develop a DS4. And if that remains the case, this is a deeply unsatisfying ending.
677	0	The expansion to Rome II is  a bit of  a let down.  I had hoped that Caesar in Gaul would have been in teh same line as what we saw in the Shogun II expansions.  Something new and innovative in the game.  But no such luck.  I enjoy Rome II, expected from from Caesar in gaul.
678	0	non-existant tutorial, clunky controls and unforgiving save system combined with long hours and having to restart if you screwed up make for a lousy game. on the other hand, nothing is m more satisfying than stalking and sinking an enemy warship. doesn't truly re-deem  it, but makes it worth 5$ or so
679	-1	I should not have gotten this game, it doesn't even install .  Thanks amazon for leaving a non-working piece of software up on your site to fleece me of money.  SUCKS
680	1	I purchase this game a year ago and had no issues downloading World Aventures even though the platform for this game is Vista/Xp and I own a Windows 7. I really wish they could off added more items to this game. I wish they could off added cars for the sims. I wasn't satisfied with Fast lane Expansion Pack. The bonus features when registering your game are 2/5. It includes a new town so its great.
681	1	Where to start? I bought this game when it was on sale for $9.99 but would gladly have paid full price if I knew what I was buying beforehand. If you're a history, geography, and tactics nerd, then this game is right up your alley.<br /><br />You can start the game as a count, duke, king, or emperor of any Christian or Muslim (with DLC) faction anywhere in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia. Actually, as the Muslim faith you will play as a sheikh, emir, sultan, or emperor/caliph. As you play you can move up (or down) the hierarchy, depending on your fortunes. Some people like starting as a count in one of the many counties of the Holy Roman Empire and slowly amass enough holdings to become a duke (Swabia, Bavaria, Savoy, etc), and eventually a king (Bohemia, Lotharingia, Germany, etc) or just straight to Kaiser! (assuming you're elected...)<br /><br />The goal of the game is to continue your dynasty/house. Let's say you're playing as king but get overthrown by your ambitious brother. That's ok! You will continue playing as your character under a new role - you don't have to maintain all your titles all the time. As long as you have an heir of your house when your current player dies the game will continue. And heirs aren't always your own children. Sometimes it's close relatives like brothers, sisters, uncles, nephews, etc. Other times you'll pass your holdings to a far distant relative that traces their blood back generations to a mutual ancestor when you're out of close relatives. If your heir is out of your house, however, and you die you lose.<br /><br />The game is extremely intricate. But you don't have to micro-manage every aspect if you don't want to. I find the upgrades to baronies, cities, and temples tedious. I'd rather spend time in diplomacy, arranging marriages for my offspring, and watching the borders of neighboring factions shift over time. In my current game I play as the King of Sweden and Denmark. The Norman conquestof England failed and the Mongol invasion of Europe led to the collapse of the great Kingdom of Rus. The outcomes are truly limitless to what you'll encounter. That's what makes the game so fun.
682	0	Was looking for a new solitare game and dig the Jewel Quest games - but it's basic solitare, would have been nice once you unlock the puzzle to level up to spider solitare or some other more challenging solitare game. If you want the basics, this will give it to you.
683	0	enjoyed it. I<br />Will buy another
684	1	This is the only other fps game I've played besides Goldeneye 64 & American Mcgee's Alice that I like. I love the silly enemies, amusing cutscenes, strange weapons, & the cartoon style ages very gracefully. My only regret is that the other Serious Sam games aren't more like this one. I also have to disagree with another reviewer on the voice acting; that's part of the humor.
685	0	love this game but as I play it on certain stages it kicks me out of the  game or when I play it for more than 30min I dont think its worth $20 but the story line is awesome I wont pay that much again for this game but enjoyed playing it overall despite the glitches
686	0	The graphics are first rate, the gameplay is non-stop, the plot is decent, I paid $50, I played for about 10 hours and finished the game. If I knew the game was so short I would have waited till it was less than $25. Right now Arkham and Arkham asylum are $12 for the pair. Mass Effect is #5 - not the same quality or level of game, but a much better value. It's a great short, very short, game.
687	0	"Nice game. Graphics are very good, though the gameplay is not really \\""racing\\"": no manual transmission, no car tuning, etc. The story is not bad, but there is no night drive, and that is sad. Besides there is too much traffic to really have fun while free roaming."
688	0	I enjoyed the general story line and the game play all well done. What really bothers me is that game makers now feel as though they need to get into extreme levels of bad language and basically porn to sell games. Its quite sad. There was absolutely no need for the sex scenes at all. It ruined the game for me.
689	0	"I love the Idea of this game its fun to play but it dose run super slow and I have a pretty good computer but all in all I like the \\""relaxedness\\"" of the game I'm hoping they come out with more games like this one ;)"
690	-1	this is NOT an amazon download.<br />Presently trying to download my purchase from &#34;steam&#34;, which is where I was redirected to to get my purchase.<br />Had to first install &#34;steam&#34; software and establish a &#34;steam&#34; account.<br /><br />Pain in the butt bait and switch.  AMAZON SHOULD HAVE STATED THIS UP FRONT.
691	0	"Half of the functions are a bit complicated, though it is very much a Sim City replica (a good thing) at heart.    Two Annoying things about the game:    You essentially alternate in this cycle of unemployment, or under-housing. So for example your \\""skilled worker population\\""  will complain there isn't enough housing and ask for you to build more. You build more and 10 minutes later they are complaining about unemployment. You then build more business/industry, and then we're back to step one when there isn't enough housing to fill all of those jobs. There's four segments of population requiring different housing, so you are always dealing with this \\""crisis\\"".     Zoning/Road building go hand in hand with each other, and it's something you have to do a lot in the game. That particular tool is VERY picky, and it constantly complains that you can't zone because of the road angles that go with it. Perhaps if the game ran smoother on my comp, then it would be less annoying, which brings me to my third point.    The game runs veryyy slowly on my computer. Especially when there's so much stuff to do, the lag between selecting tools to build really hampers the game play. My graphics card is a Radeon 5830, a card that can handle most modern games with no sweat.     I deduce that the game must be CPU intensive. I have a 6 year old Athlon X2 4200,that I guess clearly isn't enough to keep the menu's responsive. My advice is to make sure you have something with a good bit more power than that, as it really takes away from the game for me."
692	0	There is a glitch at the clock. I contacted Amazon and they promptly refunded my money. It would have been nice to play the whole game through, what a shame. Seemed like it was going to be a great game!
693	-1	Boring, empty servers, laggy maps, not enough hardcore modes
694	1	Got the code directly after purchase, with no extra fees, can't be more happy :)
695	0	"I've been playing this game for a good month now, and I think that it has ups and downs. As others have written, it is a super realistic looking world that is easy to enjoy on the surface. The three modes that are offered in the single player game are racing career, cop career and free drive. As far as the driving aspect goes it's true to life which is complicated at first, but for the most part it's simple once you get the hang of it. Now you might be thinking \\""this review seems more favorable\\"", but it isn't in the game play that this version of Hot Pursuit fails, it's the game mechanics of realism.<br /><br />Imagine yourself driving down a road in the opposite lane and you see a car coming just a little too late. You end up colliding at a collective 200 MPH. In real life, both cars would be totaled, and most likely, both drivers would be dead. NFSHP decided to follow one of those avenues. Rather than demolishing the opposing vehicle and driving on, like in other games, only collecting some front end damage, the game graphically depicts the wreck and for about 6 to 8 seconds, and you see all the ***t that just went down because you wailed on the unsuspecting driver.<br /><br />I understand that NFS is trying to be realistic about what would really happen, but the cinematic is nothing short of annoying. You hit a car, and in slow motion, sparks fly from the wreck... and then after what feels like forever, you're back on the road again like nothing happened. What I'm trying to say is that the cinematic is totally distracting from the race meanwhile you have no control over your vehicle for a few seconds after you're back on the road. However, that is just one of many annoying cinematics that are FORCED on you in the middle of a race.<br /><br />You'll be driving along then all of the sudden. Ooo, super impose on the new epic cop car. Ok back to the race. WTF. Same thing goes for every cop car wreck, spike strip hit, and EMP blast. It's like the game designers wantedto show how epic everything was in the game, but forgot to turn the feature off after making the d*** trailer. Split Second is similar, but I enjoy that game more because it doesn't take forever to get back behind the wheel. As far as I know, there is no way to turn this feature off, and besides being eye candy, all it causes is distractions that will force you to miss shortcuts and cause you to hit other vehicles once you're back behind to wheel.<br /><br />Another failure of the game is the catch up feature. If your opponent hits a vehicle and wrecks, just like yourself, he will respawn in about three seconds. Shortly after, he will be passing you at 250 MPH to regain his supremacy because \\""what makes the game fun is the opposition\\"". I say wrong. If that stupid idiot wrecked twice in a race when I didn't wreck once, I don't see how I should be the looser of the race just because of a lousy game mechanic. In comparison, if you the driver wrecks, you end up on the road again, quickly catching up because the AI is slowed down by the same game mechanic. The diffrence however is that you will not be able to regain a lead as easily as your AI buddies.<br /><br />Overall, this game becomes more enjoyable as it goes because you become more used to the games mechanics. Cop mode trains you how not to be sloppy behind the wheel, and overall it's more enjoyable. The fact is, I don't like to lose behind the keyboard. As much as I can enjoy this game when I'm winning, loosing is downright painful in this game. The slow-mo cinematics that take you away from the wheel should not be forced. It completely detracts from the game.<br /><br />I'd give the career mode of this game 6/10"
696	-1	trush! it was so bad
697	0	Cool demo/intro to MGS V, but I'm not accustomed to paying $20 for a 2 hour game. I bought this during the steam summer sales for around $5 (You'd probably want to do the same if you are planning on playing this for the PC) so I have nothing much to complain about but the game is packaged like this:<br /><br />- One short 2 hour mission. With every question answered more crop up! (I've only played part of MGS IV and no other games in the franchise besides watching gameplay on MGS and MG)<br />- Side missions are on the same map at different times of the day with different objectives: Eliminate certain targets, bring certain targets to extraction, fetch quests, blow up certain objectives etc.<br />- Extras include some soundtrack and &#34;cassette tape&#34; collectables found throughout the game.<br /><br />The main mission was well executed but it's really only a quarter of a taste of what Phantom Pains will be (in case you haven't seen the trailer which looks badass). You get one main solo mission with Ground Zeroes and side mission also solo.<br /><br />If you want to play MGS V just wait for Phantom Pain (On Steam Ground Zeroes is packaged with it for the price of a single game) or try to get Ground Zeroes for a sale price. Not a whole lot of replay value for me (Different difficulty settings + rewards for finishing missions with certain scores/grades. The rewards are something like special weapons you can begin with next time you replay the same mission).<br /><br />Stealth is definitely an essential (mostly in Hard mode, normal mode is not exactly a run and gun experience as stealth plays a huge role) but the stealth choices are limited. You can crawl in grass/vents/under objects like tankers which seems to be the most effective for getting places. No iconic cardboard box for Snake either. One of the missions was letting it on but... no. Maybe I'm not used to MGS games but the level is pretty redundant since cover is mostly always placed at crouch height.<br /><br />Overall 3/5 experience for me since I was a bit disappointed the first mission almost let on that we were going to get more main missions afterwards. My fault for not reading/watching reviews and jumping the gun on the purchase. Please don't judge me as a seasoned MGS player as most of you are but as a newcomer! My knowledge of the franchise is limited but I am extremely interested in it after the MGS IV hype a couple years ago.ointed the first mission almost let on that we were going to get more main missions afterwards.

698	1	In terms of downloading the product itself, it was seemingly effortless. An error in the expansion pack itself causes registering with the website to be complicated. The item is automatically registered when downloaded through the Origin client but it does not automatically show when viewing the user page. I believe the error was fixed after my purchase.
699	0	I recently purchased this game after hearing ALL kinds of great things and the AMAZING kinds of graphic work put into it!<br />It was doing fine, uploaded with out a problem, ran well, until I hit the part of the game when the Umbrella is introduced.<br />(The Umbrella works as a Deflective Weapon to use against the New Menacing Ruin, introduced in the same section. The<br />player is prompted to use the umbrella to deflect enemy fire to defeat the current villian and move on.) The Umbrella bug how<br />ever renders the Umbrella completely useless and impossible to equip, even if the key is reassigned. So basically, I could only<br />play 2 hours of the game and could go no further the 4% game completion. Which sucks, cause the game itself is awesome.<br />I contacted Amazon about it, who told me to contact EA, who I am still waiting to hear from.<br /><br />>:C
700	0	This game is not great and certainly not terrible, it's a straight forward shoot em up, it dosen't introduce anything that has not been done before by other games. i was looking forward to this game bringing something new and exciting from the ALIENS genres, since they've been done so many times in the video game industry, however if you are an ALIENS fan than i would suggest you get this game, even if you dont wanna pay the full price for it, you could wait and pick it up later, graphics are really good, the AI is okay, about a 10 hour campaign and also has multiplayer. but at the end of the day its just an average game that dosent do anything to try and separate itself from others like it. and thats why i gave an 8 out of ten. good but not great!
701	-1	Did not get the game.  The icon showed up, but the game is not on my computer.
702	0	This game is relatively funny, but cannot be taken seriously due to its lack of content. If they were to extend the game, or add a free roam, or any part of the game that could be taken seriously, it would definitely earn 5 stars. Total gameplay time was about 2 hour.
703	-1	"I am a fan of The Last of Us main game.  In fact, this particular game is one of my all-time favorite video games.  Do I think this game is the best game on last gen hardware?  No, I do not.  I do understand though why this game became a critical darling and a commercial success.<br /><br />The Last of Us effectively tells a story that I'm sure that most people can relate to.  This story is about a family relationship, particularly between a father and daughter (first between Joel and Sarah and later between Joel and Ellie).  A family relationship is something that most people can identify with regardless if they are close to their family or not because most people have family.  This could be a mother and a father, a single parent, or some other type of family combination.  The point is that most people have family.  Even the ones who do not have family they still have an ideal as to what a good family should be based on their personal observations of friends, neighbors, or other people they've encountered.  People can also develop an ideal about family relationships through movies, books, or television programs.<br /><br />I think the thing that propels this story to greatness is that it was written by men who are most likely fathers with daughters, have children themselves, or reflected on their own relationship with their father.  I think this knowledge aided them in writing another story about a man who is a father (Joel).  This first-hand knowledge allowed them to believably craft the father daughter relationships that were presented in the game.  It also allowed them to tell the story of what sort of psychological and emotional toll the loss of a child could potentially have on a father.<br /><br />This brings me to the DLC which is divided into 2 sections:  one set in Boston with Ellie and her best friend and the other section is about what happens to Ellie and Joel after Joel is severely injured from falling on metal re-bar while at  the University of Eastern Colorado.  There are several problems with the dlc from the fifteen dollar price tag, the story, the lack of anything really interesting occurring, and the series tendency to kill off Black characters.  The problem with paying fifteen dollars for the dlc is that the game is really short.  The game is 2 hours long. A great deal is wasted on cut scenes back in Boston or doing really boring stuff while you're in Boston (i.e. like throwing bricks through car windows and playing an in game busted arcade game that appears to be some sort of knockoff Mortal Kombat).<br /><br />The problem with the story is that men who have no idea what it's like to be an adolescent girl have attempted to tell a believable story about what it feels like to be an adolescent girl to other gamers.  Male gamers are probably convinced by the portrayal and think they're actually walking in the shoes of a teen girl.  Being that I've actually been an adolescent girl I was personally disappointed with this aspect of the dlc.  There was really not much that was presented in the Ellie-Riley section that felt authentic to being a girl in transition from the feelings of being a child to becoming a teen with all the hormones, emotions, and sometimes confusion that goes along with it as you cope with all the things you didn't have to worry about when you were a child.  This really made me wish that there were more female writers and directors working in the gaming industry and that one or more of them had worked on this story.  This could've been so much better than it was.<br /><br />Also the so called big \\""reveal\\"" about Ellie and her relationship with Riley wasn't all that big or revealing.  Something similar had already been done in the game Gone Home.  It almost seemed like Naughty Dog was borrowing this story element from this game just like they used the dinosaur petting scene in Jurassic Park to come up with the giraffe scene in the main game.  Another thing that made the so called big \\""reveal\\""not revealing at all is that in the main game Ellie stated that one of her fears was being by herself and ending up alone.  People who think or feel this way go out of their way to hold on to the important people in their lives.  As a result everything that happened in the Boston section between Ellie and Riley was predictable.<br /><br />Another issue I had with the Boston section was that this story really didn't need to be told through dlc.  If, this story just had to be told by the developers than they really should've told it as another issue to the comic book (TLOU: American Dreams) especially since this story is a follow-up to the one in the comic series.  Also this should not have been the dlc story, because at the end of the main game Ellie gives a summary as to what happened in Boston.  Seeing this story play out in dlc form didn't add anything emotionally nor contribute anything absorbing story wise. There are far too many interesting storylines that could have been explored with this dlc instead of focusing on one with a well-known conclusion (Ellie and Riley get bitten in Boston, Riley dies, and Ellie discovers she's immune).  There are so many more entertaining things to explore than this boring stuff such as Ellie's life in quarantine zone in Boston.  The dlc never truly explored this.  Players do not get a chance to know what that's like from Ellie's point of view.  Instead the dlc focuses on Ellie and Riley's reunion and what Ellie and Riley were doing in the abandoned mall(ZZZZ).  Instead of telling this rather dull story the creators could've explored the 20 years of Joel's life after Sarah's death.  I'm sure a lot of interesting things happened to him and he met a lot of different people as he struggled to cope with the loss of his daughter and survive in his new reality.<br /><br />My final gripe with the dlc and actually the main story in general is the way minorities particularly blacks are treated.  They are constantly killed off.  This is anissue of great concern.  In general Blacks tend to be stereotyped when we do appear in video games majority of the time, we are usually not the main characters, are often victimized, and when it comes to the Last of Us we just can't seem to survive.  This is truly sad because like I said I like the Last of US main game.  It's one of my all-time favorite games."
704	-1	Installed it on my computer, gave my computer a trojan virus. Later that day, $250 was taken out of my bank account.
705	1	Goooood
706	-1	but can't use a controller(no option). too many keys to use for beginner/novice players. i can watch it in third person and it looks like it would be fun. no go for me and that stinks.
707	0	Took like 2 hours to get this code
708	-1	This is terribly frustrating. Nobody seems to be able to fix the issue. Activision says they can't do anything about it, Sony says they can't do anything about and now I'm waiting on an response from Amazon.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I bought the game was so I could upgrade it. The impossibility of doing so is not being stated anywhere in the product description.
709	1	Fun game! It's like first person shooter with RPG elements.
710	-1	gets boring quick, it is about 4-5 hours worth of game but only 2-3 hours were that great. Plays exactly like the trailer, but does have a decent ending.
711	1	good
712	-1	Big disappointment. It really is just Left 4 Dead on a tropical island. Endlessly repetitive and grind-y, with a very boring single-player game.
713	1	I really like the game,but the problem is the game shut down for old computer.when I was<br />made town that 3000 people lives,game shut<br />Down and I was making them again
714	1	Excelent
715	-1	Would not even play!!!  Setup on game did not work properly and control buttons and Joystick functions had glitches...<br /><br />  Alan
716	1	It was a gift.
717	1	to the graphics I would put 90%<br />gameplay 95%<br />difficulty 30%<br />in general is a great game, the only thing that I wish to be a perfect game is that the cars could tunning more thoroughly but otherwise I love..!
718	-1	haven't been able to play this yet.  After installing, screen goes black and I'm forced to restart.  Who knows if I'll ever enchilada this kabab
719	1	Who would pay 60 bucks for Xbox live? 45 is much more reasonable.<br />Using the online game code gives you access to the code instantly so its good in a pinch also.<br /><br />Sometimes this is actually more expensive than ordering the physical card here on Amazon and having it shipped to you so definitely check into that before you purchase if you want to save 6 pr 7 bucks. When I just purchased this it was the same price so I figured I might as well go with the electronic version.
720	0	Great game, but NO SERIAL KEY!!!!!!!!!!! If you buy this game you would need to buy the serial key somewhere else.
721	-1	This game just doesn't work. The campaign and multiplayer are both fun when they work, but you'll spend more time dealing with glitches, game crashes, corrupted save files (be prepared to lose your saved game progress 3-4 times, more if you hop between singleplayer and multiplayer) and multiplayer modes that don't function. I can't recommend this game at all on the PS3 or the PS4 (I paid for the $10 digital upgrade).
722	-1	win does not like amazon game bar or whatever its called cant use for my grandchild!!!!!! should have been warned before
723	-1	Bought this,and quickly ran out of servers to play on as EA introduced more DLC. Doesn't matter if the servers are on maps you have,you can't join if they have any DLC installed that you don't have.<br /><br />Nothing like paying $60 to get the original game,and then have them say you need to spend another $60 to buy content that SHOULD have been included.<br /><br />Honestly,I should have expected that when I saw EA was involved,as this has been their MO for every game released within the last few years.
724	0	Its not a horrible game... its frustrating.<br /><br />I came from Crysis 1 and Warhead an open world game full of opportunities, choices and decisions. And walked into a plotted out/rails game of crysis 2... only one direction to go, only one way to do things and worst of all I cant even auto save. I have to reach a check point just to save my game.<br /><br />Overall the game looks amazing (highest settings on my 7970) but what is graphics when you cant enjoy the experience. I was literally forcing myself to complete this game... all the charm of crysis 1 was completely gone...
725	-1	buy an online code amazon psp and enter it in playstore q tells me there is very bad. Money for nothing
726	-1	I bought this to play and update to 2014 as I already have NHL 04 updated to 2014 to try something different and this game is not good at all.
727	1	The game expansion being available online is incredibly handy, no need to worry sbout losing discs or pass codes because it's all 8n cloud!
728	1	enjoy it very much
729	-1	It is OK because helps you with something in a hurry, but it is just a few for downloading  & obtaining big features.
730	-1	Do yourself a favor.. Don't buy this game on PC. Bioware seems like they didn't care at all about making it a good experience for PC gamers at all. The controls are GOD AWEFUL. The Camera.. ugh. I watched several streams of this before I got it for myself and looking back, most of those were on console.<br /><br />It seems like this game was made with consoles in mind, If you have to get it on PC, just buy yourself a controller and play with that.<br /><br />The worst part is, this is the game I was looking forward to most this year. Now it's the most disappointing one I've played this year.
731	0	Games awesome but the shark code they sent me didn't work so 3 stars. Had no problem transferring my account from 360.
732	-1	Just didn't care for this game. I play World of Warcraft so this game seemed kind of simple.
733	-1	I'll try to avoid repeating what's been said many times before. Spoilers are ahead, but with warning.<br /><br />Comparing ME3 to ME2 and ME1 (NOT factoring ending)<br /><br />Story: Arguably the weakest of the three entries. That isn't to say it's a bad story or game--the fact that I played it to the end shows it's a great game (until the last 10 minutes). But ironically, it feels less epic, and more formulaic, due to a lack of focus. Who's the main villain here? The Illusive Man? Reapers? As the game progresses it keeps shifting, whereas in say Mass Effect 1, Saron is undoubtedly the villain. Plot twists are more contrived and feel out of character, as though to force the story into a specific direction. There are some very moving subplots though, especially with the development of Quarians and Krogans.<br /><br />Characters: Maybe it's partly due to the game being half the length as the others, but some key characters fall flat, like the return of Ashley (or Kaidan), your new squadmate James. Mass Effect 2 develops the relational dynamics much stronger.<br /><br />Visuals/sound: production values are much much higher, especially compared to Mass Effect 1. ME1 and ME2 suffered from lackluster backgrounds that felt claustrophobic--in ME3 you see fights developing in the background scene, crowds fleeing and in general a whole lot more ambient activity. Easily the most visually striking of the three. Soundtrack isn't as memorable as previous games.<br /><br />The ending is what drops this game from a 4/4.5 star game to a 2 star. It's important to note why the ending is bad.<br /><br />- It's not because the ending is sad.<br /><br />- It's not because it's too abstract, or doesn't close all the loose ends.<br /><br />******* Spoilers ahead *******<br /><br />The ending destroys the game, and by extension the trilogy because it feels like a massive retcon from the tone and story that's been thoroughly fleshed out through the series.<br /><br />Its limited ending choices fly in the face of a consistent theme of the protagonist Shepard--that given enough effort, determination and resolve, that the hero can overcome any obstacle, however seemingly insurmountable (ie Mass Effect 2). That's not to say the end is terrible for changing that theme--but it deceives you throughout the game by making you think you can change the outcome--with a fundamental mechanic called Effective Military Strength (EMS). The implication is that by having a high EMS, you can change the tide of the war. The ending however, doesn't give you that option. So why would include a feature like EMS to falsely get your hopes up? On a side note, this also kills replay value--whereas the previous two games you could play over and over to experiment with different outcomes.<br /><br />Tragedies, whether book or movie, establish the tragic theme thoroughout, whether it's a child's book like Charlotte's Web, a movie like 12 Monkeys, or Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. ME3's story develops in a heroic-triumph theme counter to that, but does an abrupt about-face in the final 10 minutes.<br /><br />Most problematic, the ending plainly doesn't make sense. Your squadmates who are on the ground fighting mysteriously and magically get transported to the ship (which is orbiting earth in space), and run away from the battle. Why would the squad mates run away when it's been thoroughly established that they're willing to die? How did they warp to the ship so quickly? Why would the ship flee from the scene, without establishing any precedent of imminent danger from the catalyst? The problem isn't that the endings are bittersweet it's that they force nonsensical plot development.
734	-1	I love playing Canasta with friends so I decided to get this game because I figured it would be good to pick up more on how to play it but this is the most ridiculous game I have ever ordered on line. It's very hard to use, it makes no sense, the controls don't work, it's just the biggest waste of money...even for a $1.95 it was a waste of money
735	1	Nice
736	-1	I am a big Nancy Drew fan.  I have played 95% of all the CD-Rom games, and when Amazon started offering downloads for just $2.99, I was very excited.  I downloaded this game because the name sounded exciting.<br /><br />It was a big disappointment.  I'm glad I didn't spend much money on this.  First of all, the game was very short.  While other games usually take many hours and days to solve, this was only a few.  The plot was very poor and the majority of the game was spent doing stupid chores and puzzles.  It was not even clear what the mystery was.  Not to mention the puzzles were extremely difficult and frustrating.  While I usually like to try beating the puzzles myself and am motivated to do so, I kept looking online for cheats for this one.  I was always expecting for more to happen, but all of a sudden the game was over.<br /><br />There was a lot of potential for this game because of the variety of characters and various locations to go, but it was never taken advantage of.  Overall, I am very disappointed in this game and hope the next one I decide to download is much better so I can relieve my frustration.  Very poor/ non-existent plot.
737	1	Though the amazing sale i can't say that much about the games. Still, the price reducing made it worth buying the pack.
738	0	It a gift card
739	1	I regret buying this awesome games T.T<br />It so addicting I couldn't stop playing.  OMG it 5AM already!!!
740	-1	Like above!<br /><br />Nothing New! Bad Graphics! Very Slow!<br /><br />I am a Fan of AOE but this Release is only for Money making!<br /><br />An Old AOE Fan
741	-1	The enemy AI is pathetic, the difficulty in the game is based just on high numbers of opponents, plus some serious issues with USB devices causing freezes and crashes.
742	-1	Stupid and annoying.  I didn't find it fun at all. There's not much content, it just annoyed me.  The end.
743	0	This game is a blast, the actual game play is very enjoyable. However, I have to deduct a few stars due to the awful 30 frames per second of the cut scenes. I mean, come on, why make a game for a system that it cannot handle? Either tone down the graphics to speed up the frame count, or just don't release the game! For me, it almost makes the cut scenes so annoying that they're almost unwatchable, and I do like hearing the story as I go, this is a major problem, I hope this gets fixed somehow with a future download.
744	-1	this is the worst seeing that when i brought this game and i forgot to check the case that is online game code this company has the painful waiting program where you need to downloading this and that which is pain for me seeing i could careless about it.<br /><br />i just want to build my city but no it make you go threw all this step which is confusing cause then something goes wrong and that you could not use the code again because it already used but you want to reload it to get it right and plus it get lost in your computer or laptop which not anyone is computer nerd. Plus when the company explain how to load it. it just to hard to understand some of their step so if you want to get this game then go for it but i am letting you know it will take alot of step to get your game starting or maybe never plus for me it a waste of money.
745	0	I pre-ordered this...  I guess I never learn...  CIV 5 was amazing with all of the expansion packs, but Beyond Earth is a bit of a let down in comparison.  I played CIV 2 and Alpha Centauri in the mid 1990s, and I was very excited for this one.  Hopefully Firaxis will patch and DLC this game into something as great as CIV 5 became, but I would hold off until then.<br /><br />The game is graphically beautiful!  However, this game is missing one really big quality, FUN gameplay.  It just isn't fun.  Every game feels like a grind.  The game doesn't really engage you.  CIV 5 has a bright and cheery aesthetic, whereas Beyond Earth is darker and alien, which is great on the surface, but the reality is that it doesn't really work for Beyond Earth.  The dark and gritty look would be excellent if the gameplay was darker and grittier, but it isn't.  The opponent AI characters are flat and un-interesting.  The resources are confusing and non-intuitive.  The tech web is pretty confusing too and it isn't clear what you need to research in order to meet your victory conditions.  I would steer clear of this until it is heavily patched and/or has some good DLC offers.<br /><br />Also, I paid the full pre-order price, only to see, 3 weeks later, the game being offered on Steam for half the cost.  I wish Amazon had price protection for games because that is pretty frustrating.  Why would we ever want to pre-order anything when the chances of prices falling quickly are so high?
746	1	There's not much to say here, honestly.  The code was delivered via e-mail in a quick manner, and it activated without any problems.
747	-1	i dont understand how it can take so long to process an order, amazon sucks.
748	-1	I couldn't even load past the 2nd checkpoint due to a StackHash_eec4 error! I have been able to play about 4 minutes of the game. That's it. I've patched it, uninstalled and reinstalled, turned down game settings, installed new Nvidia drivers and nothing works!
749	1	Got the code right after I purchased it. It works perfectly.
750	-1	This caused all sorts of issues when installed on Windows 8.1  It was only $3 which isn't bad, but I spent about 4 hours diagnosing the issues it caused and ended up re-installing Windows.  Next time I'll stick with Steam.
751	0	It doesn't really play that good, has close to no options and doesn't use Steam cloud. Got it because it was cheap and wanted some THPS nostalgia.
752	-1	This review isn't about the game its just a warning!! YOU NEED TO PURCHASE THE FIRST GAME TO PLAY THIS ONE. Its some steam bull crap their treating this game like a DLC to the original, so now I cant play the game on my computer unless I buy the original game, which i refuse to do because i bought it already on my ipad
753	0	"Before buying this game I had no idea what the case Nancy Drew would be solving was about.  I have always loved Nancy Drew computer games and I own and have played all of the released games.  That being said, this game was a bit of a disappointment.  You are confined to one place in the game (Castle Finster) and can explore no where else.  Yes, while the castle has dungeons and secret passageways, there was no where off the grounds that you could explore, which made the game seem very limited.  Another pitfall of this game is the confusion of what you are supposed to accomplish next.  Even when I consulted the checklist on junior detective I found myself with things to do, but no idea how to do them, which was very frustrating at times.  I personally like the Nancy Drew computer games that challenge players and take a while to solve.  This game, however, I solved in one sitting and found none of the puzzles very difficult and the \\""plot twists\\"" were not very surprising.<br /><br />However, several of the good things about this game were that there were many suspects, a good plot, and characters that were pretty likable.  The puzzles were not very difficult, but many who play the game will find them to easy or too confusing.<br /><br />Overall I would give this game 2.5 stars, because there are far greater Nancy Drew games out there, but this game at least had good characters, a unique setting, and cool plot, which made it fairly enjoyable."
754	0	This was a good enough game, but seems it  doesn't stand out in my mind and I do not recommend it.
755	1	EXCELENT
756	-1	I never had any problems with anything about the game.  However, it is just a very poor quality boring game.  It is basically the same thing as the Caesar games, except way more boring.  Just kind of a crappy game.
757	1	The problem with all the servers are fixed and it is huge fun! It took 5 minutes to download and 1 to install!
758	1	Good games, and the prices are excellent, and if you can get Infinite you can enjoy of this awesome saga of games.
759	-1	Still no early access code. Unacceptable.
760	1	love  this game played it twice. you move around a bit.
761	1	I have had this game for a year and still enjoy playing it. There are so many levels and challenges.
762	0	"I have a lot of fun play this game and its pretty cool. I mean you control a squad (3 monsters) at one time switching them out as desired or needed. There are 100 different kinds of monsters and you get addicted kind of like pokemon.   PROS:  *Fun  *Replay is pretty high due to the fact you want all the \\""critters\\"" to see what they do  *Pretty much customize your ENTIRE (including the look) character all throughout the game after every mission.   CONS:  *Game patch was about half the size of the game(means poor programming and they just wanted to put something out there)  *to play you need to be online at all times(if you lose connection your game shuts off... this is very disappointing because they are trying to stop thieves and hacking but it's horrible that EA is going to this new system. Such a pain)   *UI could be better, like i don't know, maybe not only using your mouse to move the monster but also using wasd and using other keys like 1,2,3 on the num pad to switch?  *Lack of players online  Over all its fun but needs more players."
763	0	You can't jump from one fight right to the next.  You have to run around in the town between.  It's annoying for a fighting game.
764	-1	Not pleased with Solitaire product.  Wouldn't down load. I gave up trying to figure out what the problem was.  Useless.
765	-1	Don't waste your money - it is rip off and will make you mad to install
766	1	So far, I have not experienced the unpleasant issues some other people have. I hope that continues.  The game is very enjoyable and the immense size of the game is awesome. Do note that the game does not have any auto updates, which i found unusual, so be sure to sign-up for the email notices; that is the only way to know about updates released.  Another recommendation; Anno 2070.  I love it too; awesome game play on both games.
767	0	I was jaded by the early Sims . But for its cost and size it is not a bad game. a little inflexible but that goes with its size.
768	0	These type of games seem to be very popular on Amazon so I decided to try one and see how I liked it.  I thought this game was very enjoyable, the graphics are beautiful and the sound/music is incredibly soothing and serene.  Also, the voice acting by the lead character was nice as well, can't say the same about the man at the end though, but that's very minor to me.<br /><br />Unfortunately the game's major downfall was that it was entirely too short, and ended abruptly with a cliffhanger ending that makes you buy the next game in the series to find out what happened, which I'm not a fan of.  The story line it's self is quite bizarre, but I found myself actually enjoying it after a few chapters and wanting to solve the mystery, so that made the cliffhanger ending even worse.  I wish there were more locations because towards the end of the game you are constantly revisiting past locations and I wanted to see more because the scenery was very beautiful, but I felt there was some laziness in repeating the scenes so much.<br /><br />Overall I thought it was a nice game, just a little too short for me.
769	0	I started playing Flyff when I was 14 years old. Recently, Amazon e-mailed me about their Starter Kit in the game, so I decided to play it again with a new character (and now I'm 20). It was fun for a few hours, but like all MMOs, it gets old quickly.<br /><br />I know that some people love these sort of games so I won't mark it low, but MMOs have just never been my style except for a select few that have managed to hook me, such as Phantasy Star Online, Endless Online (which I got bored of eventually), and Shin Megami Tensei (which is similar to Phantasy Star and a regular console-based game that I think it's what keeps me going).<br /><br />Pros about Flyff is it's a massive game with nice graphics that's actually free. I suggest that you try it before you play it! If you like MMOs, I'm sure that you'll like Flyff.
770	1	Fun game if you want to be a pirate. If your looking for the same type of game that that this franchise has been in the pass this may not be quite what your looking for. On the other hand this is a beautiful looking game. There are islands that I just wandered around on looking at the cool scenery impressed by how wonderful it all looked. The sailing part of the game was the largest part. If you didn't like that part in AC3 this game might not be for you, if you did oh boy are you going to have fun. You can cruise around just taking over other ships for the fun of it and for the profit.
771	0	For the price the game was quite good but I don't think I would pay that much more for and it worked well on steam.
772	0	I feel bad that I actually bought this...
773	-1	Crashed every time I tried to launch game.
774	-1	The game keeps on crashing my computer and you need internet in order to play. Very dissatisfied.
775	1	Its awesome, and i got really lucky with this month's games, it¬¥s everything you pay for, it works, its simple, and its easy to use.
776	-1	Really was looking forward to this game assuming that things would be better. This is not the case. With BLOPS 2, I couldn't play core modes at all due to the lag. Seeing as they're using the same game engine as BLOPS 2, I get the same results. Can't play core modes on this game since all I get are hit markers. Have 50 down 20 up FIOS connection, wired, but still have lag. This game is crap. The only thing I can even really play is Infected or campaign mode. Core modes are off limits for me seeing as how people can kill me with 2 bullets but I it takes me a whole clip to kill them. Activision knows this is lag but keep on blaming my connection as the root cause of my lag. Surely it can't be the games fault right?<br /><br />All in all, I wasted money on this game and Activision acts like it's not their fault. Since I got the digital download, can't even sell this crap game. Patiently waiting for Battlefield Hardline now
777	1	Great price ! And easy to use. I Received my code instantly ! I thought I was gonna get a fake code but I was wrong !! Real and instant code ! Planning to buy more!
778	1	A very convenient way to buy points on the spot when your XBOX 360 Account starts acting strange. Thank God there is an alternative method to getting some points. ^___^
779	1	bought a 2 year, copy and pasted on xbox.com, signed in and instant access :)
780	-1	I'm so upset about this!! I bought it on amazon like I buy all my other games and when i tried downloading it, IT DIDN'T DOWNLOAD!!!! I'm sure the game is wonderful but it's worthless if I can't even play it!! Give me my money back!!! :( :( :( :( :( :( I tried it on 3 different computers and none of them worked. Bleh.
781	0	I gave this game 3 stars. I can see some loving this game and others not. It is linear which is fine with me as it pushes the story along. The controls are good. Not Halo good, but still good. Graphics are fine. The reason I give it only a 3...It doesn't pull me in. In other words I don't crave to play the game. If you find it for a good deal, and like FPS games then you will probably get your moneys worth, but if you are looking for something the quality of a BioShock Infinite...this is not it.
782	-1	Bought a 10 dollar code and it didn't work please amazon I don't want to lose my money. luckyly i pay for the 10 card.
783	-1	This game is just ok for me. The graphics are so-so, the upgrade options are limited, and playing without a mouse is more difficult than I'd like (I only have a laptop touch pad). I got it because it was free--but wouldn't pay for it otherwise.
784	1	"This a very fun word game for fans of all ages.<br /><br />The design is appealing and well thought out - there are multiple variations that you can play, including a \\""quickie\\"" variation called Word Of The Day, as well as an Untimed version.<br /><br />It's cool that you can change the length of \\""bingo\\"" word, and you may also save your progress for each variation of the game independently.<br /><br />If you are a fan of word games, download the trial version and check it out.<br /><br />Thanks Gamehouse!"
785	0	average rpg, lots of quests, side quests and a fairly robust and detailed character progression. Enjoyable for its price i would recommend.
786	0	It could be a Microsoft issue rather than an Amazon issue. I had to call Xbox Live support and after an hour spend working with them, I was issued a replacement code that did work.
787	-1	why the hell would i pay 104.91 when the games individually cost 20 dollars less? seriously? You guys got ripped off
788	-1	I am giving this 1 star to inform potential buyers:<br /><br />I purchased the Digital Download from Amazon but the Activation Key it came with was invalid so I couldn't play the game.  Amazon told me I had to contact Atari to solve the problem, I did but Atari did not reply.  I uninstalled the game and Amazon gave me a refund.<br /><br />You will want to buy this game for console to avoid all the PC activation and installation problems.  Or take your chances with this and hope you have better luck than I did.
789	0	Not the greatest camera angles they do not alternate like on Xbox. Also cannot transfer ultimate team from Xbox which was why I got the game.
790	-1	Code is not working... keep getting error when trying to use it on the ps3.<br />Tried using it on the website as well and it says
791	0	Got the code when I checked out. Couldn't redeem on the console, it kept saying invalid code. Finally got it to go through online through Microsoft's Xbox site.
792	-1	The someones knocking level is absolutely terrible. Repetitive. Restrictive. Gimmicky. This game isnt even on par with gtaIV. The trailers were the best part of this game.
793	-1	DRM killed this game, and seriously I would have had more fun with watching $60 burn with fire before my eyes. After Sim City 4 this is going to be the last time EA get another dime from me ever again. Can't believe they released something like this. Countdown timer is garbage!
794	0	The game play is fun and building the resorts is really fun and new but the game is really sluggish. I searched for something to fit the lag and found it is a very very common problem with people on this particular expansion pack and I find it really annoying. I can build resorts in other towns and no have any lag but I cannot explore other lands or do the ocean things in another town so it is really annoying that the lag is in that town. It is a fun expansion but the town is just really annoying to play in with the constant lag.
795	1	My son bought it with his hard earned money.  He loves it....of course. He spends WAY too much time playing.
796	1	Such a fun game!
797	1	Mortal Kombat is the best hands down! The game has a nice roster of characters and an interesting story. I believe it has all of the original characters.
798	-1	It didn't play due to some ddl that I didn't have. This wouldn't subnit so I am adding more words.
799	0	"Let's start off by saying one thing here, this game has a tremendous story. It goes chapter by chapter, IMO there's always that feeling of what will happen next (especially if you haven't read the 400+ page novel like me). The graphics is also a big feature in this game as well that also has tremendous detail. People complain about it needing a fast & beefed up machine, so they downgrade the game for that reason. Well, when you have a gigantic system like myself, I fricking love the look that the game has to offer. Those individuals are missing out. Also, the voice acting is great, it really brings out the emotion of the story as you progress.<br /><br />BUT, there's one big flaw I have to point out. If you plan on playing this on the PC, prepare for bugs & glitches. Sometimes, the game was almost unplayable as I had to keep restarting so certain AI's don't freeze in place when I had to go through a door or passageway. Certain points throughout the game, characters/monsters would shake around so it was difficult to get headshots for instant kills (to save ammo & etc.) & sometimes have lightning speed when trying to shoot enemies while they were running. It made it a much bigger challenge than what it needed to be. Sometimes though, the bugs worked in your favor. There were times where your partners would shoot all the enemies for you or you could get knife kills when sneaking behind an enemy without actually doing anything. Or some AI's would freeze while in combat, so you can run right through them without having to waste a bullet. It was an interesting experience playing this game, a mostly fun one at that (Big props to the devs for bringing out a great story), but the bugs almost made me completely stop playing the game altogether. You can have a product that can very well sell, but if it's filled with holes throughout, why even bother? Other than that, very well done & hope \\""Last Light\\"" isn't as bugged."
800	1	"This game is a lot of fun. It is reminiscent of a mix between VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy, with a sort of Limbo artstyle where you run, jump and duck to avoid obstacles in order to get to the ending vortex of light.<br /><br />There are 3 main parts of the game so far, the girl levels, the cat levels, and the race style cat levels (as of up to level 70-ish). The game is not as punishing early on (the difficulty does increase somewhat slowly), but you will get slightly frustrated at times, but not too much. The game really shines in the cat levels. The girl levels are okay, but not as interesting to me.<br /><br />There are several \\""medal rewards\\"" to win on each stage. For either completing the level on the first try, collecting the shiny thing, or completing the level within the par time. The medals did make me replay the levels quite a few times to try to obtain them.<br /><br />The soundtrack is rather calming which helps make the game not too frustrating. The music will get pretty repetitive at times, but you mainly stay more focused on the levels. The ambient sounds however are very interesting.<br /><br />There are few controls to learn. They are at times somewhat wonky (ie. wall jumping as the cat), but you will eventually just learn to figure it out or at least deal with it, but they are pretty spot on.<br /><br />Overall this game is definitely worth the small asking price if you're a fan of fast paced difficult platformers. It's one of my favorite finds in the past year and I would recommend it."
801	-1	The game was ok but it wasn't long enough! Was too easy to finish!
802	-1	"These types of gift cards are useless for the purchase of access to any XBOX LIVE services.  If you buy this, your real money turns into something called \\""Microsoft Money\\"" that can only be used for the purchase of games and nothing else.  You cannot use this to pay for XBOX LIVE access at all. The card is non-refundable and you cannot exchange it for anything else.  It is a cheat if you want to use it for any XBOX LIVE SERVICES! This is a waste of money and the description of this card is highly misleading, making the purchaser believe that it is good for XBOX LIVE when it is not. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID."
803	0	would have preferred the 3 month gold + bonus month, but for some reason it was not available, don't understand
804	1	Super easy and I didn't have to wait for the code or leave the house.............that's about it. Definitely recommend it! :)
805	-1	a short playing game,  would not let me play again , I enjoy  a game that makes you think  what do I do next.
806	1	i am nuetral...its just time card for my son.  code valid.
807	1	Playing game helps me to relax after work. Like the challenge on each level. I would like to receive more bonus time on the harder levels when you get more than 3 at a time.
808	-1	It's basically God of War meets Uncharted when you boil it down, spiced with Castlevania lore shoutouts. Difficulty is actually quite high for a game like this, as I died quite frequently. I've no shame in admitting I've since been playing on Squire. Some of the puzzles are a bit bad at letting you know what you need to do (so I should knock this thing down to make a path? What?), or what can be done (can I actually jump this?), or what you can see (the camera is frequently atrocious).<br /><br />It's also an incredibly long winded game from the length of the campaign, to the loading screen exposition; they really got Patrick Stewart to WORK for his paycheque.<br /><br />At the end of the day, there will be people that really enjoy this, but I can't quite recommend it to others looking for a more polished and tighter game.
809	0	This title is worth the $ if you are a boxing fan...but not worth a hoot if you are not.
810	-1	WHY???<br />I've purchased the other &#34;My Kingdom&#34; games and still play them BUT this game is something I will not even try to finish!<br />The graphics are horrible and the game is something a 3 year old may get bored with!!<br />THEN I had to register the game and I get popups after I quit the game.<br />NEVER AGAIN!!!!!  It's not worth 1 star.<br />Wish I could get a refund.
811	0	The new version offers a whole new perspective on the game.  Some may not like it.  The emphasis has changed from military conquest (though it still exists) to one more in line with current world problems.<br />I wish I could recommend it, but it consistently crashes at about the same spot.  I would wait until the glitch is corrected.
812	1	this game is a lot of fun to play. it is a game where everything you do has a consequence which I really like. when I tried reloading it after I wiped my computer it stopped working which is why I gave it a four out of five.
813	0	I am very disappointing in format of this game. It has great potential but needs more options. I wish game developers would realize that speed is not always what a person is looking for. This game is very STRESSFUL not relaxing  because you are racing a clock and forced to reshuffle the tiles. Then it limits the reshuffle to three and the game is over . Not what I want to see! Also it would be nice if you could tell an easy game form an  almost impossible one.
814	1	This is a great chess program. The only problem is that it is complicated. I haven't figured out all of the features yet, and there are some things that I haven't found. I bought this program for the Windows 7 Home Edition OS. I don't know if any other Operating Systems can run this program, but with the way the interface is, I was under the impression that this game only runs on Windows. I am not really sure about that since I tried to find particulars of the program but could not. The interface uses the Ribbon system popularized in Word 2007, so that is my only tip off of whether or not it is able to be played on other OSes.<br /><br />Anyway, this program contains the chess engine known as Deep Fritz 14, a board to play on, a number of different settings for the board and the pieces, a number of settings for the game itself, and some other things. It has other chess playing engines packed in, but Deep Fritz is pretty good at the game, so I really didn't do anything about changing it. As with other programs it also contains a massive database of played games. You can look up a specific game if you know the particulars, or if you are a fan of someone you can find the games they played pretty easily. Just enter the name and it will show all the games that they have a record for.<br /><br />The game also comes with a link to Playchess and a thing with Chessbase, but I don't know if either of those sites automatically give you a membership or anything like that.<br /><br />All in all, this program was worth the price.
815	-1	Totally worthless product. Download does not work. Period. DOWN LOAD DOES NOT WORK. Expects you to create an Origin account and then goes in loops but never completes the process. Thanks for stealing my money.
816	1	I thoroughly enjoy this game. It took me a week to master the first levels and figure out how to make various actions happen. After that it has been a challenge to see how quickly I can improve my scores.
817	1	It worked perfectly,but you need US psn
818	1	This is a fun addictive game that I bought here after having bought it originally in 2004/2005. Like someone mentioned, functionally it is not as difficult or robust as Robotron. I like the perks/music/guns/graphics in here better for sure than Robotron.
819	0	This game has outstanding graphics, it works well on PC not like some other EA games (FIFA 15, or Medal Of Honor Warfighter), and it doesn't have a single mode.
820	1	This was a re-purchase, as I had this game on a disc of Christmas games many moons ago, and the disc stopped working. This is one of my favorite games to play. It's difficult at times, but I enjoy a good challenge. For those on the fence about this game, it's a time management game, similar to the likes of Cake Mania and the &#34;Turbo Pizza&#34; trio. You have elves color toys for you, add embellishments as requested by the customers, and sometimes gift box the toy when asked to do so. There are a couple candy cane cookies you can give to impatient customers when they start getting upset. Each level has a 'Master' goal and an 'Expert' goal. I would not recommend this game for young children, as it's quite challenging the further you move along in the game, even for an adult. However, if you have a tween or teen that's really into games, they may like this one.
821	-1	hey, the code not work. the psn say that isnt a correct number..  can you help me please
822	1	"My only gripe is that I really liked how the levels of the previous games felt more like \\""puzzles,\\"" where the carrying out the objective was truly a freedom of choice, all the way down to selecting your weapons before the mission even started.  Absolution is definitely way more linear ala Splinter Cell, which I don't like.  The developers also have moved more in the contemporary direction of \\""unlockables.\\""<br /><br />The truth is the original formula was perfect in this series.  If I wanted to go play shooters, I'd go play them.  I didn't wait over 6 years to play an updated shooter.  I wish the current developers would have realized that the reason such a huge fanbase exists for Hitman is before the original formula for the game was unlike anything else out there.  I think they tinkered with the gameplay just a bit too much and lost some of the magic from the previous versions.<br /><br />All that said I know a lot of work went into this game, and it is a good game.  But those of us who wanted the traditional Hitman experience will find something a little different."
823	1	Unlike the previous reviewer, I had no trouble at all with the game.  Yes, an object might have been difficult to locate but the hints helped and sometimes you needed to interact with an object before you could find everything.  In general, this was a good spin on the usual seek-and-find game.      I would have liked a few more levels maybe.  Its a nice looking game though and even though somewhat slight, the story gives a good context for the activity.    At $6.99, it sure was worth the money.  Can't complain about that price!
824	-1	First, I had trouble downloading, Origin client would not recognize activation key. Went to EA site and chat help completed the download for me. HOWEVER, Dead Kel  quests do not show up in game - no recruitment letter in my inventory and going back to game starting point (as advised in old post by game devs) does not cause quest line to pop up. Looking through other reviews, I see I am not the only one to experience this problem. $10 wasted.
825	0	Strange but kind of cool and different
826	-1	Kinda dumb
827	0	I don't care for it because I'll be playing for about 30 minutes and origin will freeze and stop responding..Love the game graphics though and the weapons
828	1	nice and effective
829	0	I bought and downloaded this game. The game is good, but the titanium part is not there so all I have is Farming-Simulator 2013. If anyone knows how to get the titanium part that would great please let me know.
830	-1	i had this game and it had a glitch on selecting the military ship.<br />The rest was normal. So my problem was only a glitch.
831	1	Fast and accurate
832	0	it was not all that and it needed more levels to work on and more hidden things to work on. It was just a game but i have played better.
833	0	The download and installation is not a problem. And I know people have a thing with DRM but really, all you need is a good internet connection and play any games with DRM, it's not a hassle. But besides that, let's look at the game. For me, I love first person shooter, and avid player of it. I was expecting more from this game because EA advertised this as a game made with the collaboration with spec-ops soldiers. But this game was severely lacking in content.<br /><br />It had no new features, all you do in this game is point and shoot, that's it. Albeit, the story was somewhat engaging, but it was mediocre at best. I got to think that this game was a prototype from EA and DICE before Battlefield Bad Company 2 came out. But I was surprised to find that BFBC 2 came out around 7 months before this game did. So kind of makes you scratch your head a little bit.<br /><br />Would I recommend this game? No, get Battle Field Bad Company 2 instead, it's cheaper and a lot better.
834	-1	"-\\""Cities\\"" are too small. Forget about fitting an airport without removing 10% of your population.<br />-Communication between cities is not working properly. Resources are not moving as expected, people are not going between cities to find shops, industry, work, school and so on.<br />-EA have the worst customer relations of all. It has even won price two years in a row. They're totally ignoring poeple's problems and act like nothing is bad with the game.<br />-Lots of features from earlier versions doesn't exist. Like subways, terraforming and placing your own road and rail links to and from your city.<br />-RCI system is bugged. No matter how much zoning, they never work out.<br />-Generally, stuff don't work. Like residents complaining that they have no money, even though you have 0% taxes and plenty of jobs. Amount of resources sent to great sites differs between which city you're observing it from.<br />-Traffic. Totally screwed up.<br />-No freedom to do your own city layouts. As soon as you don't follow \\""the grid\\"", you loose a lot of space.<br />-You cannot demolish roads w/o all connected buildings being destroyed as well.<br />-DRM, you always have to be online, even if you don't play with others.<br />-You cannot save your game if you want to try something and then reload later. Everything you do will either be permanent (if you're not hit by a common rollback bug) or expensive to undo.<br />-And much more.<br /><br />This is a disgrace to the SimCity genre.<br /><br />Only positive is that it's very neat looking."
835	1	Square did an excellent job of restarting the franchise. The graphics are great when cranked up all the way and the gameplay is addiction, if a bit repetitive by the end.
836	1	love i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 this word min is realying annoying 9 10 11 12
837	-1	This is just a game for people who run bots, and this 12-POLEX crap shows that CCP have given up and you should too.
838	1	Yea great game! Fun, easy, and lots of different things to do! I would definitely buy the game again if I could.
839	-1	The game is severely limited by small city areas and online dependence.  I love to play sandbox style, and while that mode exists, it is a far cry from the flexible tool of SimCity 4, or even Cities Unlimited.<br /><br />Also, there is really only one formula for city growth (large avenues) so it is quickly repetitive.
840	-1	Worked as expected but way more expensive than alternative methods. They screw you if you have amazon gift cards r such an can only buy through here.
841	-1	I wanted to play this game in Stereo 3D, but that will be a no-go for this title. Too bad. I can't get the game into 3D mode at all. I won't finish it. If you just play in 2D it may be cool for you.
842	-1	The map in the PC version is buggy compared to the 360 version. Sometime the route disappear and I have to restart the game. Can't even move the map and the legend is so minimal.<br />Some weapons disappear. I guess I have them equipped when I create new weapon. The new weapon somehow replace the equipped weapon and the equipped weapon disappear.<br />Spent so much time to make those weapon!<br />Very frustrated and disappointed.
843	1	The gold is enough to camo the tank in all three environments. (Woodland, Winter, Desert) The credits don't amount to much but will allow you to buy at least one piece of equipment. I put improved vents on mine. I also run a camo net and binocs.<br /><br />The M22 is a nice tier 3 tank. Unlike many low tier premiums, which have a gun one tier lower than the tank, it actually sports a tier 3 gun. The ammo capacity is a bit low but the gun is very accurate, has a fast reload and aim time. It is fast, though not the most maneuverable. The 100% crew is a nice plus as it allows you to instantly start working on additional skills/perks. I am working mine towards a low tier passive scout. So, I started all three crew on camo skill.<br /><br />All in all a fun little ride!!
844	-1	This game stops cold in the first book. You can't get past draining the sink in the research lab. The assembled plunger does not drain the sink. You can't  return this software either.
845	-1	I got this game a week after it was released because a friend talked me into it. I regret this choice. I have had nothing but problems since downloading it (which my graphics card died during the download... bad omen).   Pros:  Fun gameplay  I haven't found lag to be that bad (but I'm not great anyway)  I like the stats page on the web  Cons:  Avast antivirus must be disabled to play with friends.  I HATE the menu screen BEING my browser.  I have spent MORE time with the MENU than in game.  I have spent HOURS! not able to get onto a server!  I've got to go play Halo. This is too frustrating just thinking about this game.
846	-1	I'm not even going to add anything new to the conversation.  The previous reviewers have given it enough of a butt whoopin.  This game is broke.  I just want to make sure I add to the ONE star count!
847	-1	Couldn't get it to work properly on Windows 7.
848	1	While I was apprehensive to get this title after being burned by how horrible Battlefield 3 was on the PS3, I have to say I'm actually pretty pleased with it. The download time was even faster than grabbing a game on Steam, and the ~$45 price tag wasn't bad either. The game itself was enjoyable--though frustrating at times--through the single-player campaign, and while multiplayer IS riddled with hackers and children, it still makes for an enjoyable experience. I'd definitely recommend this right under Gotham City Impostors.
849	0	This was OK for a time-killer on a boring afternoon, but it was just too easy.  I went through it very quickly.  Good for a kid home sick from school or something like that.
850	-1	I believe that some one hacked my account!  I am 66+ years<br />Old and don't even own or know what an Xbox is!  I will call your headquarters to report this!
851	-1	It would not work on my pad I have a windows rt I was disappointed because it says it was compatible but was not.
852	0	Game is ok,don't care much having to sign up on steam, a another commercial site. You can play off line with no ads.
853	0	very different video game fun puzzles but not very difficult
854	1	I downloaded this because I played the orignal years ago and just wanted a fun time waster.  I just didn't realize how much time I'd really end up spending on this, I just can't stop playing!  I've downloaded it on Windows 7 and haven't had any problems running it.  If you've played any kind of tycoon or building game then it will be really easy to catch on.  Some of the challenges can be tough, but there is also a sandbox mode if you just want to build your own park.  The expansion packs with the water slides and animals are great extras.  This game is just alot of fun, if you have the time!
855	0	I like the game but it is slow and jumpy. You can't even listen to music at the same time as playing because the game gets too slow.
856	1	Phenomenal game. Excellent graphics and story. Got it for 5 bucks on black friday, so I definitely can't complain about it.
857	1	Got it quick n easy enough said
858	1	Boy, is it cool to play these old games again.  I am actually quite surprised how much my kids enjoy them and it brings back memories for me as well!  Pretty darned smart of nintendo to still be making money of games they made so many years ago.
859	1	OSOM
860	0	The DLC was ok, I expected more like an extended storyline, but it focused more on the challenges. All the batman costume skins are great. Just waiting for the new batman to come out for ps4.
861	1	I received the code in matter of hours. It worked great and easy. I would recommend this purchase again. Go xbox!!!!
862	-1	Although the HO's are so-so, the game, itself, would best suit a child.  Wish there was an age-rating system for video games.
863	-1	This game makes it IMPOSSIBLE to shift y-Axis conversion. Even with a mapper like x-padder. Makes the game UNPLAYABLE. Somehow the idiots at Telltale thought this was a good idea?! Morons!! Last time I or any of my friends I tell about this will NEVER buy another Telltale game again!! Do NOT buy this game unless you like throwing your money away!! EDIT- And it gets worse SAVE FILES disappear also!!!
864	0	It turned out to be different than what I wanted in a game. You are timed, and the game wants you to do certain thing, in order. It is the hard way to play the game. No fun.
865	1	Awesome game!  Dying Light is pretty awesome and it is great to see TECHLAND evolve from Dead Island/Dead Island 2, two already beautiful games in their own right.  This takes the zombie fight a little further with its awesome parkour movements and fight club techniques.  There is enough content in this game from its side missions and main story to keep you busy weeks on end and when you are complete with the game it adds additional replay value with online play.  Whether your are playing with friends, against other gamers or just exploring the city of Harran, there is always something to do.
866	1	It was easy and totally satisfied
867	1	this is just like the coin op version of your old favorites.<br />as many continues as you want to give yourself.<br />shoot shoot shoot.<br /><br />Does not include the older R-types which is a shame.<br />has some other games I have not seen before and some I was familiar with.
868	1	love this game series ..... but be careful ..a tough learning curve learning how to balance what forces you need to finish mission
869	1	Good
870	0	"UPDATE FOR REVIEW:  There is an activation code that has to be used in order to get the game to play.  When it says \\""register\\"", it means enter the registration code which shows up in your game library.  It does not mean register with your name, etc.  When I chose \\""register\\"" on the popup, the screen came up that gave me the line to enter the activation code and the game has opened (haven't played it yet).  Do not know if the popups advertising other games will continue to come up.    Original Review: ATTENTION AMAZON:  Popups constantly appearing on your screen from evidently game producer \\""Screen Seven\\"".  One popup wants you to REGISTER WITH THEM and  BUY the game (which I already purchased from Amazon and Amazon's site says I bought it), and the other popups want you to download other games.  You CANNOT move the popup to get it off to the side (very annoying when you are playing another game), you have to close it. Popups come up even when game closed.    After initially launching the game when downloading finished, I tried to play it and then closed the game itself.  When I tried to open the game to try to play it again, \\""Screen Seven\\"" would NOT let me open and play the game unless I first registered with them, which I do not intend to do.  I don't know what problems would occur if I registered.    You have been warned.  If you do find out how to play it like you normally can with Amazon game, please post review so I can follow what you have done.  Thanks.    If the popups don't stop, I will have to remove the game from my computer and HOPE that by doing this the popups will stop.    As to the game, I have only tried to start it.  Have only tried to play it for a few minutes due to the popups, and the rules are very different.  All in all, I am very sorry I purchased the game and downloaded it.  I just hope the popups quit.    This company has several different games now on Amazon and I think they are a new vendor as none of their games have any ratings or reviews."
871	1	This is a great game.  I played the original X-Com many years ago and enjoyed the heck out of it.  This one carries on many of the old facets using modern technology and graphics to create a wonderful expansion from the original.<br /><br />The ONLY complaint I have is that they didn't make the aliens as evil as they could have especially during the combat encounters.  Although battle is quite good they could have added a tad more randomness and alien AI to cross the line into awesome.  There is still a lot of challenge and the need for strategy...and strategic game saving...but that last bit would have certainly put the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this to any fan of the old X-Coms or anyone who just wants a good ole Alien battle game.
872	0	This game may have been good when it was released but now it is showing its age.  The graphics are mediocre and the gameplay and storyline are not great either.  There are people to shoot though and that always counts for something.  If you like to use a 360 controller for playing PC games you will need to use  a controller emulator like Xpadder.
873	-1	DID NOT WORK----------JUNK,JUNK,JUNK.
874	0	EDIT #2: After the latest patch (which introduced a separate patcher program), NVIDIA Optimus support seems to be broken once again. The game only runs on the integrated Nvidia card.<br /><br />EDIT: As of the 304.48 Beta drivers, NVIDIA Optimus seems to be working properly. My rating still stands however.<br /><br />Those of you running laptops with NVIDIA Optimus will have a lot of trouble getting the game to work properly with your dedicated graphics card.<br /><br />Initially, my game installed fine and patched as well. However, the game was running using the integrated Intel graphics card rather than the dedicated GT525m GPU causing it to run much slower than my laptop is capable of handling. This occurred even using the latest drivers (version 296.10 and version 301.24 beta). Long story short, I was able to force the game to use the right GPU by setting my GPU to connect to an imaginary external monitor, which made the game run properly. However this exploit came with problems of its own and is incredibly frustrating to get to work properly.<br /><br />Other than that, there is little that needs to be said that hasn't already been told in reviews. The game is solid, has excellent animation, and has flaws here and there. If I had to point out something, the load times seem a bit high and menus are slow to open and close.
875	1	Perfect
876	1	This is by far one of the best games I have played in years. It is very challenging and very rewarding at the same time. The combat is fun and engaging. You may die a lot while traveling the seamless world (with no loading!) but hopefully you learn from your deaths. You really never become overpowered like some games and you can pretty much die to any mob at any time if you are screwing about.<br /><br />Now about the port. I keep seeing it is a terrible port etc. It is a DIRECT port from console. PC gamers made a petition to get it ported and From Software did just that for us! That being said it does still show controls for the 360, the resolution is upscaled when using larger resolutions making it not look the best. The keyboard and mouse controls are difficult although many people use those. I recommend a controller.<br /><br />The good news is there are easily installed mods to fix the resolution scaling and several other things. The first of which is DSFix by Durante. If you don't get any other mods get this one. The game will look much better and has some other nice features to it such as HUD scaling, save game backups, etc. There is also a fix to help with the keyboard and mouse controls called DSMfix. Don't let this scare you off because it is an amazing game. These mods make things look and work better on the PC since it was directly ported from  console.<br /><br />tldr; Amazing game directly ported from console. Get mods, a controller, and enjoy one of the best games released in years!
877	0	The multiplayer is great but the single player is pure awfulness. They rip off Call of Duty but then add 10 times the QTE scenes and have even less variety in the gameplay. It's awful. You'll love it! 10/10
878	0	If you like the Brothers in Arms series you will probably like this one.  No major changes or updates versus the Earned in Blood game of this trilogy.<br /><br />3 Stars because<br />Good:<br />Characters, story, gameplay<br />Bad:<br />Certain missions drone on, gun wobble is terribly annoying, player is restricted to certain tactics
879	-1	I can't say much that others have not covered.  Every server based EA game has done this on release. They are cheap on servers. They probably robbed another game of these servers they added just to run SimCity.. errr relocated, like they did with the XBOX and PS3 Battlefield 1942 arcade, and other releases. There is a reason EA is the worse ranked company by voters in the world.
880	-1	it does not work for windows 8
881	-1	2 weeks after purchased banned I quit this horrible game. The community is dying And I hope it gets shutdown with all the problems it has
882	-1	Given how many people have trouble with the motion mechanics on some first-person games, the description really should include information about 360 degree movement. I managed about 10 minutes behind the swooping cursor before I had to give up. Some may gripe that I'm giving it two stars when I managed only 10 minutes, but if it's unplayable, it's really worth zero.
883	1	Having this available gave me the availability to be able to get the new map pack for COD, I was really happy about it. Thank you for being such a great price, and thank you for the fast delivery.
884	0	When I bought this game I thought everything would work, but when I tried to log-in it asked for a serial key, so I put in the registration key and the SpecAct key and neither of them worked, so I cant go on the multiplayer and all I have to do is the campaign. So if anyone could please help I would greatly appreciate it!
885	-1	Pauses every 10 seconds, no known fix, and now I'm stuck with a game I can't play at all.  Crazy bug.
886	1	The Gift Card helped a lot thanks so much i will buy more of these hopefully in the near  future!
887	-1	I've been playing guitar for 11 years and spend most of my time on acoustic guitar but I bought this game to increase my use and repertoire on electric guitar.  It has accomplished that--to a point--but not without some major frustration:<br /><br />THE PROS:<br />- You'll find a lot of creative games to teach basic skills like scales, slides, vibrato, etc.<br />- The &#34;Session&#34; mode is a really fun way to jam by yourself and the variety of scales can really enhance your improv skills<br />- You'll learn the basic skeleton of a lot of popular songs rather quickly<br />- The download (Mac version) went smoothly and the game playback has been without issue<br /><br />THE CONS:<br />- The Riff Repeater (which is the heart of the game and key to actually being able to play the songs accurately) won't allow you to freeze a short passage of notes nor will it allow to break down the song in increments smaller than its pre-programmed sections.  This is the major flaw of the game and it's an absolutely HUGE mistake on the part of the programmers.  We're talking epically bad oversight.  If you've ever tried to learn a solo note-for-note, you know how painstaking the process is.  Now, imagine not being able to freeze the tablature to study tiny phrases and imagine only being able to hear the phrase in the context of a 20 second clip of the song.  You try to catch a flurry of notes but miss a few, so you then have to rewind back to the beginning of a longer section, which when played in slow motion is 3x longer than the actual 20-or-so seconds.  That's Riff Repeater.  It's absolutely maddening.  This game should include a patch that allows you to freeze Riff Repeater and create your own custom sections to loop.  Otherwise, the Riff Repeater is useless.<br />- The game sometimes doesn't pick up more nuanced sounds like the second or third note of an octave chord and will not allow you to progress through a section of the Riff Repeater if your difficulty level isn't adjusted properly.<br />- This game may fool you into thinking you're better than you actually are.  Best to have a separate program recording what your guitar is actually playing so you can give yourself honest feedback.<br /><br />Based on the last couple of weeks of game play, I wouldn't recommend this game to those wanting to actually learn songs.  For a bare bones beginner, there will be lots to look at to keep you occupied, but if you looking at something to take you from intermediate to a higher level, this isn't going to do it.
888	-1	I did not like this game, it was boring and I do not recommend purchasing this game.  It was too much reading and not enough hidden objects.
889	1	Amazing game! Co op is great
890	0	It isn't the worst game ever. I would have been disappointed had I spent more than seven dollars on this. I'm a big fan of the Hitman series and this game doesn't live up to it's predecessors. It has it's good moments and a decent story. At some points it feels like a linear shooter, and at some points it feels like Hitman. If you're a fan of the series please get it; if not then wait for it to go on sale. I have high hopes the next installment will be the best of Blood Money and Absolution.
891	0	I went to a friends house to play this when they first purchased it. I was very excited to play it since I absolutely LOVE The Sims franchise. This Stuff Pack was lacking with just about everything. I would say that these items should have been a bundle from the website, not in a $20.00 stuff pack. $20.00 is just too much for so few items. The hair styles are lacking, the men and women have the same new 80s hair styles, which shows the EA/Sims team did not put much thought into this at all. The clothing is just OK. Most of their clothing hails from the 80s, and there are a few suits from the 70s and one grunge outfit from the 90s. The items in Buy Mode are alright, nothing special. EA/Sims could have done MUCH MUCH more with this stuff pack, or even if they made it into a full expansion pack, it would have been THAT much better. This is what Im REALLY surprised about... there is no 70s-80s-90s radio station. To me, that makes no sense at all. They should have atleast done that, but they really half assed this stuff pack. For instance Master Suite Stuff Pack is amazing! 70s, 80s, 90s Stuff Pack is lacking in every aspect, and Im wondering if they did not just throw this one out there to satisfy requests from their customers, Im probably right about that. I Would say if you have some cash to put into this and wouldnt miss it, or dont mind not getting a ton of content for the price, then do go right ahead and purchase this. If not, just wait for the next expansion pack to get your monies worth. 3 stars, wish it had more.
892	0	I'm sure there are people who would love this game. There are literally thousands of little bits that can be analyzed and tweaked during your game. But for me it was just too much, too fast. I don't get a lot of time to play games these days, so I'm never going to have the time to focus on this long enough to make any progress, so it turns out to not be the right kind of game for me.<br /><br />It is a game that you are meant to obsess over and research every choice. Who should marry who to strengthen your House, where do you place your armies to counter your enemies build up, etc. When I had a lot more free time I would probably have loved this game, but now I can't justify spending that much time for any one game, especially since I can't play it in many short bursts as you have you track too many details if you want to make the right choices at the right times.
893	-1	So I downloaded it and its whatever. Its not the best quality and my person that I created glitches out all the time and pisses me off. The worst part though is that it messed up my mac. It kills the battery within an hour and it literally shrunk the amount of screen I can use. I restarted it a few times and its still the same. I'm pissed. My friend downloaded her own illegal copy and that works better. Never again.
894	-1	"EA has gone too far in ruining a game with their ridiculous and contrived DRM this time.<br />This PRIMARILY SINGLE PLAYER game REQUIRES you to be connected to the internet CONTINUOUSLY to play. Good luck getting online though, the servers are always down. Even if you manage to log in, 90% of the time you can't actually do anything, because it will be unable to load or create any cities. Furthermore, all the cities are saved on their servers, so good bye to any city you've made when the server you were on crashes, again. There are countless bugs that make the game obnoxious, in addition to the fact you are \\""lucky\\"" if you manage to play it at all. Oh, one more thing that is annoying: you are required to play through the tutorial when you join a server, bleurgh. Worst gaming experience I've had to date, blows D3 out of the water. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
895	1	I liked this product because I got to get 400 ms points and I got a lot things like indie games and I changed my gamer tag with previously bought ms points. My gamer tag is: Sharp117
896	-1	If you buy it , you will have a lot of technical problems and bugs during your game , Don't waste your money!!
897	1	Aside from the occasional lag (which happens regardless of the card, I've got a GTX 580 @ 800mhz core), the game is amazing. Having played both console versions the choice is clear - just make sure to hook up your 360 controller! You'll be able to play at 1080p resolutions or better, get 60fps and much better anti-alliasing. The added framerate does wonders for the expressive animation. Not to mention the price, $25 vs. $50.   As for the game itself, it's the best Sonic since Sonic 3 & Knuckles! The only minor quip I have is that Classic Sonic's rolling physics aren't quite up to snuff but it's miles beyond what we saw in Sonic 4. Anyone touting the greatness of the Adventure games is blinded by nostalgia or was very young when those were released. Everything beyond Sonic/Shadow levels was poorly executed, not to mention the godawful camera.     Don't be dissuaded by accusations that the game is short, there's a slew of challenges which put a spin on each level to the point of completely altering the gameplay. I've clocked 12 hrs on the PC and have quite a few challenges to go!
898	1	I love the game it gives another dimension to the sims.<br />Easy download as well. will continue to upgrade sims like this rather than the discs :)
899	-1	I was so excited for this game to come out, but because of the online play requirements I will never buy or support this game.  I will boycott this and every game that is made to play that way! Please reconsider this ridiculous and unnecessary business model.  What a complete let down.  Shame on you EA.
900	0	I gave it 3 stars for 2 reasons. first, i wasn't able to download it at all. it is fully able to work with my windows 8 laptop, but it didnt download. so that brought it down, it would have been 1 star if i didnt buy it from someone else. i had to wait a few days in the mail, but it turned out to be an amazing game. i play it all the time and it is a near perfect game for me. i encourage everyone to make sure you will be able to download it before you do.<br /><br />I recommend this game to every gamer!
901	0	it was good for killing time but it doesn't interesting after finish at once. all same action pattern monsters, same place and no more special thing after the end. especially  absent of multi-play convenience is very weak point in this game i think
902	0	not enough levels.
903	0	The game is a little hard to grasp at first but once you learn how it goes, its pretty easy to dominate!
904	-1	This game has so many flaws and limitations that there can be no doubt that I was misled when I made my purchase because my expectations were such that I was led to believe I was buying a product that produced a high value of entertainment which this does not.  CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.  EA / Maxis has admitted publicly that the release of this game was such a failure that they will be providing a free EA title to those who have purchased SimCity.  Quell the masses with cake.  I just want my money back and I do not want another EA game.  EA also has threatened that if you demanded your money back then your Origin account would be deleted and banned.  In other words if you had purchased the Walking Dead game, Sims 3 add expansions, etc. then all those games would become unplayable because you were banned.  This games problems initially were log in crashes.  YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CONSTANT INTERNET CONNECTION TO PLAY!  NO OFFLINE OPTION!  I like offline games.  When I need to get the laundry going or run to the store, just press pause, but not this game.  Next the area to build your city in is vastly too small due to the server traffic and the fact that some computers have slow connectivity to the internet which means the game would run so slow you wouldn't be able to do anything if you had a slow computer.  But for those of us who have faster PC's, we are limited by real-estate area restrictions because of slower computers that have to connect to the server. Quite the drag.  Next the AI for the sim people, fire trucks, police and ambulance vehicles is all a joke.  Realism is colored with the EA sky, which is not blue... more like plaid.
905	1	Fantastic game, all of the new and old features combined deliver a fantastic 3rd edition to Dead space.  New customizable options deliver a more optimized killing arsenal than ever before depending on your style of play.  Use all the same guns that you know and love, or change it up with weapons like the shotgun javelin!  New game+ offers further upgrades to keep the game alive even after you reach the end.
906	-1	This is horrid.  Expected a fun, polished version of other games like this and cannot play it.  You need to download patches and do a lot of research.  This product just doesn't work and should not even be sold.  I'm taking my loss and moving on.  There really needs to be a disclaimer about how you cannot just download, instal and play.
907	-1	They messed up one if my orders on here and I want my money back so make sure they dont do you
908	1	If you grew up loving the classic adventure games (such as King's Quest), you will for sure enjoy this journey. It is set in a magical fantasy world (beautifully painted backgrounds) and has interesting characters (great voice acting). The story is so creative (it is more mature and darker than the classics) and intriguing that it will keep you up all night to find out what happens next! The puzzles are challenging in a fun way and not at all frustrating. The second game in this point-and-click series (Memoria) steps it up and takes you even further into the world and the characters and magic within. Highly recommend both games (play them in order as the story continues)!
909	-1	Have purchased many games through Amazon over the past two years, but Hidden object bundle 10in1 is by far the worst I have ever received.  I have been very happy with the other games I have purchased and have replayed them many times.  It won't prevent me from ordering more in the future, but I've noticed there isn't as much to choose from anymore.<br /><br />J.P.
910	0	The game is just too complex and for those who are not die hard Total War fans will have problems going through a long campaign mode. The in-game battles are fun and at times difficult but the challenging type of difficult. The economic part of the game is just downright frustrating and for me was the thing that killed the whole game for me. As a fan of Japanese history I was excited to play this game but I never was able to feel comfortable or excited about any clan. The Shogunate attacks are a terrible part of the game as it doesn't matter how strong you are as you have to defend yourself against the entirety of Japan at one time. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a Total War fan. In my opinion there are better Total war games out there to spend your time and money on.
911	1	I love this game.  If you're a FPS sniper fan, this is the best.  I've played it through dozens of times.
912	0	I really liked this game for about 4 hours. Then i actually got bored! I really wish that they put an actual story together. It feels rushed! But at least it didn't try to be something that it wasn't which is a really good shooter. Or at least good for 4 hours! lol :)
913	1	"BEFORE I BEGIN, IF YOU ARE A TRUE SPLINTER CELL FAN YOU MUST PLAY THIS GAME ON PERFECTIONIST MODE. There is no other way to play imo. Nowadays too many shooters are too easy. You spend 60 bucks and in 8 or less hours you're finished. Maybe you could go back and find all those stupid \\""collectibles\\"" or something similar that nobody cares about but the real fun in this game is taking your time with the missions, sneaking around, doing intel, and bleeding 'em out one by one :). It makes it so much more rewarding. There is the main mission but on top of that there are optional missions you can play to earn more money for upgrades as well as co-op and vs. modes. I'm not into all the fancy gadgets personally (I like to take my time and take them out one by one like the old days without using a stupid drone or some sticky camera that shocks enemies.) So many shooter games are just too easy (The last one I played was Dead Space 3 and even that was easy on Hard mode). The gameplay i'd give a 9/10. Graphics 10/10 (Plenty of options...not a cheap console port). Replayability 8/10. For this game I will say spending an extra 10 bucks for some extra guns is ridiculous. Just buy the regular game. Plenty of guns and items to play with. Half of them you probably won't even use. Overall 9.5/10."
914	0	It didn't keep my interest for very long.  I enjoyed skyrim better than this game.
915	-1	Bad picture and picture shakes, is not stable. My games are usually great but not this one. Don't waste your money.
916	0	This game is fun up to tier 3. After that it is intentionally frustrating to compel you to spend money on leveling. You can play for free, but you won't enjoy it. There are people in the game who spend hundreds of dollars per month and they are going to have better guns, bigger engines, better crews, better ammunition than you.
917	-1	I've been a Sim City fan since the original. This is no game. I've only seen the client loading screen because I can not log into a game to play a game I spent 60 dollars on. Never again will I buy a online only pc game. I'll just take 60 dollars out of my wallet and burn it because that would be better than sitting on the sim city update client screen.
918	-1	After being a loyal SimCity fan from very old Maxis age (ah, my chilhood), I went to a friend house to enjoy the game.<br /><br />Zero, nil, it didn't work. I guess the other reviews are enough to give you an overview of the problems, I can only confirm them.<br /><br />The only way to stop this stupid EA policy is to refuse to buy anything from them. Sad, but true.
919	1	This product is MUCH cheaper on Amazon, good job Amazon, stick it to MICROSOFT, they stick it to us all the time !!! GO AMAZON GO !
920	-1	Seriously?<br /><br />Can a game company really be this bad at making a game?<br /><br />Yes. EA is.<br /><br />As far as i'm concerned EA is no longer a game company; Herpes is more entertaining than this game is.
921	0	"The best thing about this game is that it is downloadable, so one doesn't have to wait several days to start playing.  The only other casino game I've owned is \\""Monopoly Casino\\"", which has a neat concept, but is poorly executed (for example, playing Texas Hold'em in MC, you could be looking at a full house, but the game only recognizes that you have a three of a kind.  I've not experienced that bad of a mess up in Hoyle Casino Games).  The other reviewer is right that you want to turn off the speech and animations fairly quickly--it just takes too long.<br /><br />The game I play mostly is craps, trying out different betting \\""systems\\"".  It's got blackjack, of course, Texas and Omaha Hold'em, Five card draw, and seven card stud.  It has Pow Gai poker, keno, baccarat, roulette, and horseracing (little mechanical horses).  There are slots, video blackjack, and video poker, as well.  There's a \\""tip/tutorial\\"" feature that warns you if you're about to make a dumb move, and gives suggestions on what to do next.<br /><br />The poker games can be played for cash, or in tournaments.  The other reviewer's observation that computer opponents tend to raise-raise-raise for several rounds is correct.  Tournaments can have a $1k through $50k buy-in, with excalating amounts for the tournament winner.  If you make it to the third round of any tournament, you at least get your buy-in money back.  There are several online sites that allow you to play against real people (for fake money) free of charge, so don't get this game just for the poker is my advice.<br /><br />There's a feature where you can design your avatar's face as well as a choice in a variety of stock voices.  If you run out of money, you can get a loan (which the casino owner's thugs will force you to pay if you win big at some game or other), but if you run out of money a second time, you must restart your character.  The graphics are serviceable but dated, the music is a generic jazz-style tune that plays in a loop.Not a bad game, for what it is."
922	1	Awesome Game Thanks Amazon!!
923	1	That guy is a bunch of bs. This game is pretty good. Most importantly it's fun.
924	-1	To play this game you must have the UPLAY software connected to the internet at all times. It is more then a little annoying to be kicked out of a single player campaign after a couple of hours of play time because your internet carrier has a glitch. I can not see how this makes the game any more fun. The game itself seems to be just like the Might and Magics of old but after 2.5 hours of playing, what I mostly remember is the problems with the DRM. Since it is not mentioned above, I thought that it should be. (It would have effected my buying decision)
925	-1	Not one of the better games in my opinion. For example, finding the differences between two similar scenes involves finding miniscule differences...like a little tiny squiggle on a rock...  I find that ridiculous.  the pictures are very dark and very hard to distinguish items.  when asked to find an object, it might be so small, you just can't see it, or so dark, you just can't see it.  I found it very frustrating and I love challenges but not this game.
926	0	Love m hidden object games. Three in one seamed like a deal, however the second one in the series didn't work at all, just froze at the beginning.
927	1	Excellent
928	-1	30% of time is spent playing, 60% is spent waiting to join.  Once you finally play, you realize you don't require aim to be decent, you just shoot in their general area.  If you like FPS that are competitive and require you to aim, do not buy this game.
929	0	Eddie Riggs, a roadie for an underwhelming rock band who bemoans the death of 'real' metal, is transported into a hellish world where humanity is kept in thrall by demons. Discovering that in this world music has real power, manifesting as combat abilities, Riggs joins a rebel army that is trying to bring down the demons and helps them organise for one last battle against the darkness.<br /><br />Brutal Legend is a curious game. It's a heavy metal/comedy/action/real-time strategy game set in an open world and featuring personal combat and driving sections. The game feels like it was made by Double Fine Studios taking every 'awesome' idea they could think of and hurling it at the wall to see what would stick. It certainly feels like a game that lacks a clear vision of what the developers wanted it to be, and whilst it may be an adequate jack of all trades it is a master of none.<br /><br />The game opens as an action title, with you directly controlling Eddie Riggs. You can kill enemies with your giant axe or electrocute them or set them on fire with special attacks from your guitar (which overheats if you use it too much, limiting its use). After a few minutes of this the game seems to get a bit bored, so Eddie spontaneously builds a car out of scenery, has a boss fight and then roars out into an open world, which you can explore to your heart's content (if only briefly; it's fairly small as these things go) to find unlockable skills, upgradable powers and optional side-missions. When you pursue the game's main storyline, it then rather abruptly transforms into a strategy battle game.<br /><br />In this battle mode, you have a command centre - your stage - and an enemy HQ - their stage - that you must destroy. You gain resources in the form of adoration from fans, who issue forth from geysers (I think the heavy metal/RTS metaphor was straining a bit here) which you can tap into with merchandise stalls. With more resources, you can build more troops and upgrade yourstage's capabilities. As the game continues you unlock more units, so you can build everything from a basic infantry grunt (head-banging nutcases) to a massive siege unit (a huge tank thing which call down fireballs from the skies). Your character, Eddie, serves as the commander and a powerful unit on his own right, and must join the fight directly to ensure the battles are won in a timely manner.<br /><br />There is a big problem with this: Brutal Legend may now be out on PCs, but was designed for consoles. So rather than controlling the battles with a mouse, multi-unit selecting and intelligent hotkeys, you're instead struggling with a UI designed for console joypads. It's hideously slow and inefficient, requiring Eddie to be close to units he wants to give orders to (or constantly performing a tedious guitar solo minigame to summon units to him from across the map). Carrying out pincer attacks is therefore almost impossible. Indeed, the need to be simultaneously giving orders, building units and summoning them to you whilst also have to directly get involved in combat is initially overwhelming and confusing, with you losing battles due to having to fight the poor controls as well as the enemy. This problem eventually disappears once you get used to what units to build and in what order, at which point you simply steamroller the enemy and the game becomes trivially easy.<br /><br />Brutal Legend is therefore a bit of a mixed bag. The humour, the writing and the voice-acting (most notably thankfully restrained performances from Jack Black and Tim Curry) are all top-notch, though some of the celebrity voice-overs are better than others. Rob Halford and Ozzie Osbourne give it their all, but Lemmy (from Motorhead) gives a fairly catatonic performance throughout the whole game. The game has a strong visual style, with the stylised 3D graphics complemented well by the excellent 2D artwork and the idea of a world based on metal album covers is successfully implemented.<br /><br />The gameplay is all over the place, however. The solo combat sections are fairly decent, but quite brief, and the escort missions are a bit tedious (though a sequence in a dark swamp with Riggs riding a fire-breathing panther and having to clear a route for the tour bus is quite atmospheric). The battle sections make up a substantial chunk of the game's playing time and are unfortunately the game's weakest link, being poorly-controlled but ultimately far too easy. The game's single-player storyline is also fairly risible in length, clocking in at barely five hours.<br /><br />All of that said, Brutal Legend (***) has a fair amount of wit, charm and imagination going for it. Like most of Tim Schafer's games, it's fun, but the gameplay struggles to keep pace with the ideas. It's definitely worth a look, but only if you can find it at a budget price.
930	0	Ping isn't good :( Whatever, it's funny game
931	0	Other than that, there isn't much here. You point and shoot with no real aiming at enemies who are usually too far away. you remain stationary and are protecting, God-knows what. No plot. Meh.
932	1	Digital media has been the future, but today is the present.<br />PSN cards are the best ways to acquire digital content.
933	0	The game has some good visuals but overall feels like a port from a console game. The controls are not precise and its a 3rd person shooter. The storyline is ok. This game could have been made much better. Overall its ok especially if youve got nothing else to play.
934	0	This is an improvement over the first installment, however, it still has the annoying situation where you have to scroll left and right of center screen to see the entire area that needs to be searched. In addition, there is an object in each scene that you can search for in addition to those objects listed (it is absolutely unrecognizable in some of the locations). Still, I consider it worth playing.
935	1	I had a problem with Paypal so i came here a bought this code and everything when awesome.
936	-1	I used to like this game but now its bad, no controller support or anything. Maybe for the price its not bad but..
937	1	Good
938	0	Don't buy it,most of the servers are empty !
939	1	convenient great buy
940	1	Fun, great adventures and sorties!  Difficult to learn carrier landings, but once mastered watch the scores rack up for your grades!
941	-1	I couldn't get it to come up on my computer.  Cause the Amazon program you have to download is a joke it will not open.
942	0	Macs are not gaming computers. While my solid state drive resulted in quick and smooth gameplay (which in Empire Total War is EXCELLENT), if you're someone who HAS to have good graphics in your game, I would recommend you either buy a PC, or purchase this game ONLY if you have a higher-end macintosh.
943	0	so so game.  The graphics are good but the story and gameplay is so so.  If you want something simple to just pass the time, it's ok, but I wouldn't really recommend it.
944	1	Great
945	0	I was looking at civilization related games and this one popped up. It has its civilization similarities but the overall game play is not at all like its predecessor.
946	0	Great training game for new sniper shooters
947	1	works great for me!
948	-1	I thought it was more on an adult or teen level but it was not what the pic shows try an 6 yr old level.
949	0	This really shouldn't be called a video game. It's more like you set up a scene with only a few choices, then watch it happen. I would have given it more stars if I actually had more control over aspects of the scenes, like if I could pick out all the things I wanted for the people like longer hair, changes in tats, clothes, body types, etc. But I bought this knowing it wouldn't be an actual video game, so I wasn't really disappointed. It's not a game, people! You just set up the scene and watch. That's it. I do agree that it's rather overpriced. That and not having enough control over what the people looked like were my only two complaints.
950	0	This game is a lot of fun. It plays a lot like the classic civilization 3 game with improved combat and improved graphics.<br />Biggest problem with the game is that while it takes a while to play the game play is repetitive. Maybe I'm just not that great of a player.
951	0	I bought the game the 8th of june, and It said that I was obtaining the perks of doing pre-order, but I didn¬¥t get nothing of it, but the standard edition.
952	1	If you like sim games, you'll probably like Hotel Giant 2. It's a little frustrating for the first 20-30 minutes as you figure out the basics, but after that, it's great. I didn't see a manual included with the download, but with a little Googling I was able to find a PDF version that clarified a few things (particularly the room sizes and associated &#34;class&#34; ratings).<br /><br />My only real complaints while playing were that (a) all rooms had to be perfectly rectangular, which was awkward on floors that had unusual layouts, and (b) a lot of the wall choices were really ugly.  A couple of times, the game seemed slightly buggy when I first opened it, but exiting the hotel and going back inside was always enough to fix the problem.
953	1	This is great for anyone who plays on their xbox 360 and wants a challenge by playing online. I got the online code so I was given the code right away and was ready to go on multiplayer on any game that I have. This Gold membership doesn't just give you the ability of multiplayer, but a whole range of things you are now open to do supplied by microsoft and the features they have
954	1	I seem to be in the minority, but I think this is the best of the Farm Frenzy games.  The game involves buying animals, upgrading buildings, and producing products to sell.  You'll have to keep the farm stocked with grass and water for the animals, collect raw materials, and produce finished goods in craft buildings.  You'll also need to earn money to finance all these things, and keep predators (bears) away from your animals.  I enjoyed this game.  It's long, and you'll get plenty of gameplay for your money.  My main complaint about the game is that you have to repay to upgrade your buildings at each level.  I wish that upgrades were permanent.  There are many subsequent games in this series, but I've found those to be basically copies of this first one.
955	1	Great fun ,I'm Batman
956	1	I finished this one fairly fast (only took me about 2 days) but it was fun none the less. You get to learn about Scandinavian life, sailing, and various other things.
957	1	Easy to purchase and worked great.
958	0	It's a nice update from the past<br />better graphics. Seems to be more towards reality. üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑlike the game and would recommend
959	1	Easy to purchase. Just write down the code (or print it) and enter it in your 360 and it's done. I will be purchasing  again.
960	1	I already own at least one copy of each of these games and yet I'm buying at least one of this pack. Reasons why:<br /><br />1) They're just that good. The DoW franchise is one of my all time favourites, and TQ Gold is one of the best Diablo-style games ever.<br /><br />2) THQ is no more, and the more copies of their games continue to sell, the more their IP will be valued at (I hope). DoW 3, Last Light, and CoH 2 need to be made.<br /><br />3) All my gamer friends already have all of these, but I might make a new one who doesn't some day.<br /><br />4) When THQ's properties are purchased, their game prices will probably go back up to their prices a year ago (no crazy flash sales) and then they'll be worth something for Steam trading.<br /><br />And all of you should buy them too
961	1	Hi, I bought this game about 5 weeks ago. It¬¥s much fun although it is in european landscape. The gun shake is getting on my nerves. You may shoot foxes and badgers while looking for the prey of the day. There are many guns like a precision rifle, a bolt action (you can¬¥t repeat) and many more. There are some small game Hunts, Big Game Hunts (must unlock at the Acedemy)and bird Hunts. Big Game with rifles, others with shotguns. Many Animals, even sikas and chamois! All new dog mode is pretty difficult but is also fun. But it laggs. Thats why it gets 4 stars.
962	0	"so i've tried quite a few 3d games, and they ALL suck. they ALL give you headaches. except for this game. it is so simply designed that the 3d actually looks really cool and pleasant to look at.    however, the game itself is just, bleh. it was fun for the first like 3 matches, then it was like, \\""umm, wanna play something else? plz?\\""    id rather just play a real game of drunken jenga in front of us.     stick to the demo to check out the 3d, because after you get impressed by the 3d for about 30 min, you're then gonna be over it."
963	0	Well the netcode in these modern shooters are just a joke any more. Empty a round into someone to kill them, yet they take you down in 1 or 2 bullets. Next time you do good, then next time you can't kill anyone. I don't get it. Maybe I am just getting old, but the old shooters like Unreal Tournament 99, it was skill, now days it is how many unlocks and what level you are seems to decide who wins, and of course knowing how to get the crappy netcode to work in your favor helps too.<br />Lots of buildings in the levels, lots of glare in some levels.<br />The guns don't offer much variety, most do exactly the same damage, and the only real factor usually is the rounds per minute.<br />Be warned you will need a fairly powerful PC to run this game and to be able to compete. My PC is on the lower end so that probably doesn't help.<br />Think I will stick with more casual fun games like Guild Wars 2.
964	-1	Although I bought the american version (nothing stated it wouldn't work) and i'm from UK it didn't work for hell.<br /><br />Contacted Origin. They said it should work if i bought the bf3 standard edition, so i bought that also - that didn't work either.<br /><br />I spent god knows how much on these two products and i didn't even manage to play any of them. Origin is terrible, absolute horsewank.....it kept coming up with a black screen. So i googled it and LOADS of people are getting the same problem. I would stay well away from Origin. I'm never buying an item from Origin again.
965	0	It's a little hard to control, and it's hard to navigate in the game. It's been making getting past the beginning stages of the game into the first real mission hard, and I am an avid gamer.
966	1	He loves it and the price better than department stores!
967	-1	this game has a great concept. only problem is that is dosent work. it is buggy, slow and basically drives you insane.  i want my money back.  if you buy this game, you will hate yourself.
968	1	Civilization V is a great game, it is a strategy game that is relatively easy to pick up and play. Though it isn't everyone's cup of tea.
969	1	Fast and simple! The service itself is great for the free games on both the 360 and One. Playing online with friends is great when it works properly.
970	-1	takes huge space and requires downloading new software. The result is very disappointing.  Navigation within the program is difficult and not consistent. Cannot go to other games once you open the program and chose one game. Tons of completely useless features -- huge library of backgrounds and music for example, and and lack of features and options that you really need -- like cards appearance and size.
971	1	Very Good, but pushing to buy in-game characters etc is a cheap gimic !
972	1	What great action pack this game turn out to be. I've hours of fun shooting and blasting!! The overall look of the armor suits is great, especially the tank dude. He's my favorite by far!! Can't wait when they make action toy figures or model kit of it.
973	-1	I can play it maybe 1 time a week. Its actually downloaded to my computer but will only run half the time, I definitely would not recommend.  I've contacted Amazon but they say there not liable. There's other channels I can take but really don't want to invest the time and energy.  Thanks Amazon!! Disappointed customer
974	0	"Dragon Age 2 is the heroic dungeon crawling sequel for the Dragon Age Origins saga, but other than the title name \\""Dragon Age 2\\"" the game is a lot different and smaller by comparison. (Don't get me wrong) This is not a bad game, but other than the improve graphics and combat play; Dragon Age 2 falls really short from the rich experience that was Dragon Age Origins.  So, other than to follow what happen after you beat Dragon Age Origins, because you are able to transfer your DA Origins Save-file to DA2; to beginners I would say - Skip this game.  There are far better RPGs out there and unless you actually planning in playing DA Origins to begin with - DA2 is not worth it."
975	1	The advice in other reviews about getting this to work in Steam pushed me over the edge. I picked it up and wasn't disappointed! A huge pile of fun goodies to play is all I can ask for such a bundle. The controls are well mapped, the UI is a little odd until you realize that they're really just running a virtual machine and booting each cartridge as you select each game.<br /><br />The graphics smoothing helps, though there's obviously nothing to be done for it being low-res.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this to gamers who remember the old days.
976	1	graphics were amazing
977	1	Good!
978	-1	lots of hesitation, nothing like the originals for quality, does not play smoothly like Kahuna or Kahuna II. guess one gets what you pay for....
979	0	So far it's just ok. The lack of content has caught up quickly, as well with my friends and clan mates.  It has quickly (rather instantaneously) become my least favorite game to play, in lieu of Diablo and other new titles. I took a break 3 weeks ago and haven't bothered since, whereas it had been the only game I spent my free time on, despite owning other unplayed games.
980	-1	Very repetitive. Each stage is basically the same as the last one before it. I got bored early on doing the same thing over and over again.
981	1	The best game I have played all year!  This game is truly a masterpiece....I wasn't even expecting it to be this good, as I have played all the previous Tomb Raiders.  You won't regret this purchase.  I bought this at the same time I bought the new SimCity....lets just say I was 1-2 in picking a decent title :)
982	-1	i dont know if this is only because i installed the game off a disc a while ago then bought this today and now it requires a disk to play so i just wasted 25 dollars unless anyone can help
983	1	Buying Xbox Live codes online makes sense. Copy and paste into your account right through the browser, and you get your Xbox Live fix for another year.
984	1	Extremely Convenient and useful.
985	0	it was ok, and $/HR wise i got my moneys worth, but the game has gone downhill since early rs2, so i rate the card what i'd rate rs3.  direct connect was very convenient though.
986	0	Looks and feels like a PS2 game ...<br />this is both a good and a bad ...<br /><br />The game which I remember playing which kinda resembles this would be<br />Sakura Taisen on my PS2 (the last PS2 game I bought )<br /><br />If you order the other Sword art online game on PS4 as a preorder you get this game for free ...<br />I opted to just buy this to try out ... it was a good idea on my part since I doubt I want to play<br />the other one or even continue with this one ...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I love Anime and this one in particular ...<br />but the presentation of it is not what I've expected coming from playing<br />a bunch of Tales series games which flows better in both action and character driven dialogue
987	-1	Not too bad, but a bit boring.
988	1	This has got to be the best downloadable game released on PC, 360, and PS3 this year.  The design and art style are what you would expect for a major publisher, but the gameplay is definitely something out of an indie team.  The mix of genres (Tower Defense/Action RPG) think Diablo and Plants vs Zombies, but all in 3D.  The PS3 version actually support 3-D glasses.  If you have that setup check out the free demo on PSN.    The game is fun and addictive since it has you playing with up to 4 people online, beating up lots of bad guys, and collecting wild, powerful weapons.  Tons of characters to develop will have you playing this game over and over again.  Its a fun game you can play for an hour, or get sucked in and play all day.  Get it, play it, and have fun.
989	1	This is my 4th day on this game and just when I think it's done something else pops up.  This the best game I have ever purchased.<br />You'll love it.  PS no violence.
990	0	Was hoping for a graphics and speed update... Loved the game when it came out, but does not carry over to modern pc's very well.
991	1	Thanks to this Upgrade Pack, I can upgrade my normal Dead Island to get all the DLC. Didn't manage to find the DLC upgrade pack on steam. Came across this packon Amazon first on a sale.<br /><br />Pros: Dead Island is a fun game alone or co-op with 2-3 other person, finding and collecting loot, crafting weapons. 4 unique characters that had their own role and play style. Experiment with each character tech tree.<br /><br />Cons: Weak story telling, Badly Animated Cutscene, NPC Animation was quite bad. Especially noticable during NPC escort missions where you can follow them and look at the way they walk or run. Weak presentation of quest, nothing unique in the way the NPC tell you about the quest. Average Voice Acting. Didn't really come across any quest that tells a story or plot related. The Vehicle handling and the FOV was not very good in first person or in vehicle. The game wasn't properly optimise with more video options. Have to find tweaks on forums and youtube video to make the game runs better. Bad chat window for co-op if not using mic for voice. The text is quite small and it disappear quite fast  and you can't see the text history. You might be busy fighting and miss the text. Human enemies animation was quite bad also. They way they move.<br /><br />The game is still enjoyable for the game play in some degree,. Alone or co-op. But this game is not for everyone compare to Left 4 dead 2 which is easier to enjoy for the general mass.
992	1	Easy, simple to activate on steam. The DLC comes with the download, you just have to enter the codes you get from Steam and you are set. The game is awesome as well.
993	1	Excellent storyline in a series filled with excellent story lines. Play the series in order or you are missing out. Gets better all the time.
994	0	I was loving this game.  My X box 360 controller suddenly and for no reason stopped recognizing this game.  MY gamepad still recognizes my other games so something happened within this game.  I was playing this game for about a month with the controller, so I know it should recognize it.  I posted a help question on Origin, so we will see what come of that.  The menu options in this game have the x box 360 controller.  I also had a problem with windows live installing the game.  I read an Amazon poster who said to keep closing the game.  I finally got the game to install following his advice.  His post is the first one that shows in most helpful.
995	0	A pretty fun game at early levels but did not hold my attention much. Did not subscribe after free trial was over.
996	1	"This is a great game for all-but particularly for adults. It is even more enjoyable if you have read \\""The Great Gatsby.\\"" It integrates hidden object, mini-puzzles,and a room building experience. The visual graphics, acting, and music do a great job of re-creating \\""The Gatsby Era.\\"" Let's have more intelligent, non-violent, adult games!"
997	0	I PAID for this game, but in order to play it I must login to the download site.  This is wrong on many levels.  I don't need a bunch of extra stuff clogging up my computer or my internet connection, and I shouldn't have to do so since I actually BOUGHT the game.<br /><br />The game itself is still the same fun addiction that it has always been.
998	1	Totally worth the $10 I paid for it. I have been put in more time with this game to get my money's worth.
999	1	Good game i love it!!!lets play<br />This great game ghost reacon future soldier<br />Have great time fun fun fun haha
1000	-1	What a cluster and a bummer wrapped up in steaming dog crap!  The Origin client is not ready for prime time.  If you buy from someone other than Origin (like Amazon) you are going to have major difficulty installing and configuring.  Amazon was great and refunded my account even though it was a digital download.  Bought the physical media today and installed with no problems.  Lost time and effort really bums my out but I am very appreciative of Amazon going above and beyond.  Thanks.
1001	1	Required for pretty much anything you do on xbox live. Like that they email a code instead of ailing a card. All digital future is coming sooner then some think
1002	-1	downloaded twice installed twice....doesn't work (missing files????)  WASTE OF MONEY
1003	-1	Don't buy from this link. You cannot download it! And you cannot return it!
1004	1	Everything ok
1005	0	Ok, so when I sit down to play a Pirahna Byte (PB) game (which I've been doing since Gothic), there are certain things I know to expect and not to expect. I expect a good story, engaging characters, lush, vibrant, cheesy, outdated graphics, caves everywhere, and lots of character/class choices with a learning curve that will have me replaying for weeks. But it seems things have changed a bit, as this game is very unclear and frustrating. Even for a PB product.<br />Gone are the roaming AI animals who used to stalk and prey in packs and on other packs if they crossed paths.<br />No more richly decorated rooms with tons of items to nick.<br />Gathering (herbs,items,gold) in general has been reduced<br />Hunting is no longer a skill and can be done through tools you buy/ find<br />No longer do different ores create different armors/weapons<br />Sneaking is incredibly easy (and strange) since people are no longer really sleeping in their beds as much as laying down waiting for morning<br />The npc interactions with each other is almost nil and daily activities means most npcs shops are outside their huts/houses. They never move more than 15ft from bed to work.<br />Most skill animations are gone (sawing, woodchopping, skinning, etc) and replaced with mini games (drinking, some sort of skee shooting)<br />These sort of things were kind of the 'magic' of PB games- and when removed from the game it's much less easier to forgive the some of the games very blatant shortcomings:<br /><br />As for the game, well, its ambitious. The pirate themed RPG take is interesting. The backdrops are very lush and green, sunlight streaming through the canopy, many more caves that first Risen, but that unique ability to solve a quest though combat/stealth/diplomacy is also gone.<br />It offers some unique features like having monkey/parrots as utility pets, unfortunately I couldnt make it that far.<br /><br />Combat. Plain and simple, it is terrible. Frustratingly terrible. Make you want topunch kittens terrible. Again, I will go back to my roots of Gothic and say that I had no problem using my spacebar to block even though 99% of every PC games used it for jump. This is PB, I adapted. Unfortunately you cannot adapt to a bird, a crab or any other mob in this game from stunlocking you at will. And for as long or as short as they want. You can have 100% life and a mob with 2 hits left to death can (and most likely will) turn around and hit you 8,9, 10 times in a row until you are dead. All you can do is reload and take a deep breath.<br />Which leads me to the games seconds biggest flaw: Leveling up, the haphazard way the trainers are thrown around and the basic overall sense of confusion when trying to build a character.<br />Training a weapon not only requires finding a person who trains but also that particular type of weapon. And almost all the trainers on the 2nd island are offering skills/abilities you'll never be able to learn in the given time.<br />So after many retries using various different build types (high DPS, high Toughness, high Cunning) I can tell you it doesnt matter what skills you raise, you're going to die. A lot. To terrible combat mechanics that you are all but powerless to stop. You cannot perch mobs and because of this HORRIBLE new idea of food regenerating at a snail's pace, you will go broke either buying drinks or the materials to make them. Keeping a party member around helps alleviate this but you shouldnt have to rely on bait to survive, and if you do they should never leave you. Unfortunately none of this excuses a lowly level 3 crab pecking a decked out level 23 pirate to death.<br />Maybe a patch will fix this but for now, combat is ridiculous and just silly. Still love ya PB, good luck on the next one.
1006	1	While it's always going to be annoying having to spend money on anything,for $40.00 dollars for a year subscription on Xbox Live I can learn to live with that.  Also it's helpful and convenient to be able to get the code online after purchasing the card instead of having to a gamestore and buy the card there.  Once you punch in the redeem code you good to go, again while a little annoying for $40.00 dollars for a year of XBL I guess its' an affordable price for any Xbox 360 and Xbox One gamer.
1007	-1	If you don't know who Rayne is, you're probably not alone.  There are some obscure comics I've never read and a series of movies that went from OKish to progressively more and more terrible.  They also released two games on the old 6th gen systems (PS2/Game Cube) that were not well received.  I liked those games though.  The first one just made the confusing error of putting all the tedious and annoying content up front so I think most reviewers gave up before the good bits.  The second, well it was repetitive, but made me smile.  So a new one comes out a while back and I finally pick this up when it goes on sale.  Well, it's kind of more like the movies for me than the games.  Short version with this game, I really enjoyed the first half of the game, sort of enjoyed the next quarter, then gave up when I was just getting angry.  Longer version of events continues below.<br /><br />The game is a 2D platformer with heavy &#34;puzzle&#34; (i.e. precision platform jumping) rather than a brawler.  If you played Guacamelee which came out a few years ago, this is pretty close to that.  The graphics look great, hand drawn, and there is a lot of blood.  Moves appear limited, but are mostly just worked off of how you use the controller while pressing your single attack or jump buttons.  You can suck blood from many enemies to replenish yourself and if you don't drain them dry they're infected and you can blow them up at any time like a bomb.  Dodging is mostly done by a dash button.<br /><br />Sounds really good and I decided to try it out when it was on sale.  I really wanted to like it and did for about the first half, but then problems started becoming more annoying.  High jumps are rather twitchy to perform and on tight ledges can be very tricky so as you have to do more you'll notice them more.  The hit detection is questionable in part due to the animations.  It's hard to tell when something should touch and not in the background and with some enemies.  This isn't so bad in combat, but when it comes to precision jumping where the slightest mistake is instant death or at least starting a big chunk of work over, then it becomes a problem.  It also doesn't help that at times the game puts something at the end of a long setup that you have to experiment with to figure out what they want you to do.  That's not necessarily bad, but tie that with a long set up and instant death if you guess wrong what they wanted and it becomes an exercise in frustration.  Using a Xbox 360 controller is more pleasant than keyboard.<br /><br />There are some non-skill related painful design and reliability problems with the software.  The HUD showing your score can sometimes block your view of enemies at inopportune times and lead to your death.  Also, it commits the ultimate sin for a tough game with challenging play through.  It is glitchy and crashed semi-frequently on my Windows 8.1 machine; it won't save in game because it's supposed to be tough so if it crashes you get punished for their poor coding by having to play the whole level again. Not acceptable in this kind of game.  Got to the end boss, game crashed again during the end boss fight.  I'm out.  May come back to finish some day, but I doubt it.n it comes to precision jumping where the slightest mistake is instant death or at least starting a big chunk of work over, then it becomes a problem.

1008	0	It's a very short mission, especially if you're levelled up and have a decent arsenal. I beat this mission in under two hours :(
1009	1	Borderlands Game Of The Year is a great game, plus two other good action fps games was the righ choice thanks that fantastic price!
1010	0	EDIT: the server maintenance was gone the same day once i got back from class<br /><br />ok ok ok... i put off buying this for MONTHS.. for bad reviews... bad setup on EAs part... etc etc youve read it all... so i ended up caving in simply because i got sick of cities xl.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /> *the game plays!

1011	0	"I downloaded this game on March 5th, the day it became available. I went with the download option versus the DVD option as my MacBook Pro doesn't have a built in DVD drive. The download and install went fine, but the game play is extremely buggy. It quits and/or freezes a lot. There may be times it lasts 15 minutes, sometimes an hour. I know it's not my computer because it's a brand new MacBook Pro 15\\"" with Retina, Intel Core i7 processor with 8GB of ram and an Intel HD Graphics 4000 512 MB for a graphics card. If the disc option works better and you have a built in disc drive, I'd recommend going that route...at least until EA gets this fixed."
1012	1	I like this one best because it is not so intense.<br />The first half of levels are easy to get through<br />for an experienced Build-a-lot player. However,<br />it does get more complicated in the second half.<br />You can use different  scenarios to accomplish<br />the set goals. It is very fun and a person can get<br />through it in one day.
1013	1	This game was the best!  The graphics were outstanding and disturbing at the same time.  I loved it.  I play it over and over.  I think I need to get a life.
1014	-1	I'm having the same issue as above.  The Xbox recognizes the code and knows it's for MK3 but won't download it.  It just gives an error code.
1015	0	This is one of those games where playing the demo is almost as good as buying it. The goofy combat system gets old fast as do all the endless subquests. Not really my cup of tea. Nice price though.
1016	0	This game is rage inducing. I really love the graphics, and the stimulating atmosphere is amazing. However what is not is how hard this game is. I almost never rage at a game and I have now quit this game more than ten times in the past two months that I have had it. I havent even played it that often because of how unfair it can be! However I would rate it five out of five if it was not so hard, and this is coming from someone who played dead space three on hard. With little problem and no modifications.
1017	-1	We could never get the game to load.  Couldn't get help form site either.  I would not recommend this game.
1018	1	Haven't finished the story arc yet, but I can say that this game gets five stars from me. I love the assassins creed games. I was trying to get some of my friends to pick it up and play with me. The sale that happened today was enough to make me buy two of them copies as gifts.   Yes... I am that excited about it lol.  They have made some improvements to the game which really add to the gameplay. I think its worth letting you learn what those improvements are, but they are well worth it :).
1019	0	I was expecting a little better like the tomb raider.
1020	0	Spore is quiet a fun game that lets you create the most amazing things, creatures, armor, houses, ships, you name it. I guess you guys download this and share your creations online.
1021	1	I have brought 3 $50 codes (one per month) and I haven't got any problems. Right when you complete the purchase you recieve the PSN code, no waiting times, this is a fastest and safest way to buy an online code :)
1022	0	Over the past many months there's been a huge hype over how amazing this game was going to be. Giant robots and fast paced shooter and all this mumbo jumbo. Well they were right, that's exactly what it is. Giant robots and mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />First hour of playing it was really enjoying to see all the pretty graphics and new unlocks and getting into the game. After that though you start to realize that nothing is happening.<br /><br />First off, your unlocks mean nothing.<br />Although the guns all have different stats and cool readouts on the unlock page, you'll come to notice that there's only 7 primary guns. Short range, shorter range, medium, shotfun, long range, sniper, etc. There's no, hey this gun is also an assault rifle, but it functions differently. As in, maybe perhaps burst fire or semi auto or full auto. Instead all the guns apart from the shotgun and sniper are full autos. On top of that, they have no recoil and they have no bloom. As long as you're aiming down your barrel, you have near perfect aim.<br />Sidearms, there's only 3. The first one literally auto aims for you. The second one auto aims as well, but does a good job at hiding that fact, but doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get that kill. 3rd pistol I wasn't even up to getting it. You get it near the end of your levels and well, I couldn't play it for that long.<br />Perks, there's 2 sets of 5. No one is better than the other, because they're all situational really. If you want a shield, put on the shield one. Damage? Damage one. It's just preference.<br /><br />Difficulty?<br />This game actually does a good job of not being difficult to pick up, and it balances the mechs so that they don't steamroll the infantry. A sole infantry can kill a mech, and vice versa. So that's good to note.<br />Most of the time you'll be seeing bots. Oh lord the bots. They're extremely special, they won't even shoot at you if you're moving, you need to stand still and hopefully one of the clone trooper's aim's will hit you. On a good note though, it does add a little flavor to the game that it's not just a barren wasteland like it would be otherwise.<br />Barren wasteland. Without the bots you'll find yourself in very large, complex levels with only a 6v6 team. Most of the modes you don't even actually act as a team though, you just run around with no heads and kill stuff. And once you do lose your head for real, you'll be respawned in half a second to do it all over again, because there's no respawn timers. There's no punishment for doing horrible or being untactful.<br /><br />Leveling, oh my.<br />Leveling isn't really a pain at all, in fact, it's probably one of the good points of the game. Your XP comes at a considerable steady, quick paced rate. A majority of it will come from doing fun challenges such as wallrunning while shooting people, or kicking their faces in. The problem is, you're already level 30 in no time. In my few hours of playing I already hit level 10. In one sitting I've done 1/3rd of the game so to speak. There are &#34;prestiges&#34; though like you would see in COD, and function the same. But that's just a lousy workaround for not having enough content. Congrats! Now do it over again. And again.<br /><br />The size of the game, quite... Quite large.<br />40gb is what you'll be seeing. Thankfully Origin actually does a good job of downloading it at a steady and fast rate. Starting to see a trend here. Come to find out, that's not 40gb of content. That's 39.9gb of sound that they boast about. Which brings me to my next point.<br /><br />Sound?<br />The 39.9gb of sound that takes more time to extract than the actual game has to install, sounds.. horrific. This could be due to my sound card not being dedicated nor 2015 rate. Actually it's only a 2013 board, so sad. But it's constantly distorted or goes out entirely because so much is trying to be played at once. Not to mention the only sound that is playing is the assault rifle sound, titanswalking, you walking, and you walkingX8 (AKA, the titans coming down). Seriously, the titan's fall sound sounds like HL2 engine's walking sound when you're sliding off a cliff and it plays extremely quickly. You don't hear much more sounds than those. It doesn't even sound realistic! Why is it 39gb?<br /><br />Netcode! Hello BF4. If you don't get the reference, you may want to google BF4 netcode and you'll see just how awful that game was, and the netcode nearly completely ruined it. Basically they put a bandaid over this one and shipped it off to Titanfall HQ. The problems still exist, they just show up 3/4 of the time.<br /><br />The game itself isn't terrible, not at all. It just feels like I've picked up COD after 4 years and I'll put it back down after an hour. Nothing new is brought to the table. If you want to have mech wars go play Hawken. If you want infantry go play Unreal. All it did was take two games and smash them into one, it didn't bring anything new to the table.
1023	0	For one, you MUST have Dragon Age: Origins installed for this to work so keep that in mind.<br /><br />As for the game play it is just as good as Origins. Great story also but the game is way to short, this should be a DLC not marketed as a full game. I did many of the side quests and still beat the main campaign in 5 hours.<br /><br />For the downloading process it worked great, and installation was a breeze, I just wish this was 9.99 and not 14.95 because it really is just a DLC.<br /><br />Also, you can import your old characters from Origins if you wish.
1024	0	Lags way too much!
1025	0	Decent graphics....of course, many figures are Eastern in design and nature...typical for this genre. I found that there was a lot of server lag for me to be able to function well in High graphic environments like dungeon/instance battles. As well...the endless zoning in this game really needs to become seamless like EQ2 or Wow or any of recent MMO's.....too much time zoning for me. It was a nice try, but not for me....
1026	1	Long long story and alot of replayabilty, really enjoying it so far 30 hours in!
1027	1	Ordered and had the online code in minutes. No waiting for a email, or waiting for the mail to run.
1028	-1	It won't open. It downloads, tells me there's an update... but times out before updating. Have tried finding the update online for a manual update as I read a few places that would fix the problem. However, I wasn't able to find one that worked. If getting a refund was an option, I'd take it.
1029	0	The creators of Shadow Complex weren't lying when they said their main inspirations for creating the game were Metroid and Castlevanie SotN. When all things are said and done they accomplished what they set out to do. A solid 2d/3d game with fun power ups and heavy exploration game play. Unfortunately the game comes up short when it comes to plot. If I had to do it all over again I probably wouldn't have paid 15 dollars for it, but it was a decent way to kill 4 hours on a Sunday. There are alot of things to do in the game, and one play through probably isn't going to get you anywhere near 50% completion if you power through the story like I did.
1030	0	I was disappointed in this game.  I was expecting a seriously scary game and this, well, wasn't.  The first half of the game finds babysitter and children alone in the house.  Instead of fending off spooky things, you'll be spending your time cleaning up after mischievous children.  The second half finds you in a much spookier part of the house, but it was really more disgusting than spooky.  Basically, I didn't enjoy this game all that much.  That may just be a matter of taste.  The graphics were well-executed, and the objects were well-hidden.
1031	1	By the time I logget into eve it was there.
1032	-1	I bought this game but was never able to download because they never send me the download link and now its showing as if i never bought it. They will just take your money and hide because after several attempts to contact the authorized personnel they never respond. Please save your money and bypass this game because its not worth it.
1033	0	you can get so much on multiplayer because of this but if you don't play multiplayer don't get this and if the server is full and you have to wait they will put you first so you get on the server fast
1034	1	I am so happy with this system , is very fast .
1035	1	What a ridiculous game.  I don't even know what to say.  If you're looking at this game you probably already know what it's about :)
1036	0	I had issues getting the multi-player to work, but its still fun, then again I'm using a mac so, some trouble was bound to be had.
1037	0	I liked Guild Wars 2, it is perfectly at the state of the art, impressive for something fresh out of the gate actually (just think of what a dud Lord British's Tabula Rasa was). Great graphics, great beat-em-up-flash!-blam! combat, great UI.<br /><br />But state of the art is also the problem with it. If you have played World of Warcraft or Everquest 2, you have played this game already. The grinding, the crafting, all pretty much the same. Sadly, I won't spend much time on this, I just don't have enough cycles lying about to play something that I have already played years ago.<br /><br />If you are new to MMPORGs, this is for you, its great game play and it is free to play after the one-time purchase of the actual game.<br /><br />If you are an old hand, don't bother. There is nothing here for you.
1038	1	DOOM was easily one of the most groundbreaking and impressive games of its time and as an avid gamer of over 15 years I must give credit where credit is due. My first experience with DOOM was so many years ago that I recall loading it up on FLOPPY DISCS onto my computer with a giant cold war era monitor. No joke. But I will be the first to tell you that those floppy discs transported me to a ruined science facility, the shores of hell, the pit of the inferno and back again all in one night.     The amazing port over to the Xbox 360 has gotten so much right. When playing through the campaign on Ultraviolence I realized the controller feels more natural to me than the keyboard does. Movements when side strafing are easier to execute and hitting the windows key when you meant to fire the rocket launcher at a slobbering demon will no longer be the cause of your death. All the acts are here including an extra one not included in the original trio ( the difficulty of which is really ramped up). There is no lag or slowdown whatsoever. I havent played the multiplayer, as I havent found anyone on yet, but I have beat the entire SP campaign and can say that despite whats going on on the screen there is no system slowdown. The graphics are nostalgic, the atmospheres creepy, the sounds as classic as the first time I heard them and the levels filled with hellish monsters to blast holes in and secrets to be found.      Overall the game is one of those games that should be put in the library of congress to maintain video and computer gaming history. In a day and age of overhyped, overpriced games that fall short of delivering, DOOM stands like a towering cyberdemon.  And for 5 bucks I really dont see how you can go wrong.      Whatre you waiting for?! Get to work Marine!
1039	0	I expected the game to have more than one room.sense i already have the first one.the game ended to soon.
1040	1	An excellent deal, In just three months I have played games for a value of more than $50, so it is already pays it self by today.
1041	-1	wouldn't download properly and play
1042	-1	can't get it to work. I have tried ever thing I know and it will not work how do you open a
1043	0	Super fast..smooth cas. Seriously lacking in content though.
1044	0	When I buy games, there is one thing I don't like -- different games using the same graphics and interfaces as one that I have played before... it is like they just took the old game and gave it three or so extra bits of glitter... At least when the makers of the Casear series made Pharoah... they created new graphics and slightly different environments.... I had hoped that this would have been a return of the older quality rather than a &#34;if they can use it so can I&#34; rehash.<br /><br />So, I have played this before and did not realize it until AFTER I bought and downloaded it...<br /><br />would that there would be a good old-school quality to games coming out now with the new story flare to give new life -- especially since it seems that movies - tv shows and music are all just an alteration of the older stuff... one would hope that game makers would be the relief, but no such luck here
1045	-1	After playing this about 8 hours I think SimCity 2000, 3000, and 4 are better games. I have been a Sim City fan for years, but these features ruin the game for me.<br /><br />1. Cities are too small - I'll be a couple hours in to a new City and my City's land will be full already. Very aggravating because that's about the point where everything starts to come together. You have to try and fit in all the cooler buildings somewhere somehow.<br />2. No Offline mode - Always need an internet connection.<br />3. Water being a finite resource that doesn't seem replenish. It never rains in SimCity? You can't use the river for water? Ughh...<br />4. Fires...way too many fires. A normal city doesn't have a ton of fires usually. In SimCity there are tons.
1046	0	The good: ME 1/2/3 all included in one package. All of ME1 DLC is included.<br /><br />The bad: the following DLC is missing:<br /><br />ME2:<br />Lair of the Shadow Broker (really good)<br />Overlord Pack (meh)<br />Arrival (mainly a solo dlc pack)<br />Kasumi - Stolen Memory (get to add a new character)<br /><br />ME3:<br />From Ashes (pretty good)<br />Leviathan (pretty good)<br />(anything else currently out)<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />ME3 plays on with all ME2 DlC considered canon and played whether or not you have actually purchased it.<br /><br />Conclusion-<br />As a player of the entire trilogy, it is hard to recommend this to people new to the series. The only period I would do so is when this is on sale. Also keep a look out if you can buy these separately at a cheaper price, because this collection is no different from buying the games separately.
1047	-1	It's okay, I guess. But not worth the price tag, unfortunately. If I had to say something about it, it'd be about ten times better if the cities were allowed to be twice as big...
1048	-1	Its a pretty easy and fun game, but I gave up on it after a week, cause I would spend 2 hours making a city, then it would burn down.  There was not one single time that I ever played, that I did not give up due to my city burning down in 4 minutes.
1049	-1	This is not the best simulator graphics are awful along with the trucks be just like cars... they accelerate faster than a real truck
1050	0	fun game, but a little too short.
1051	0	Great concept but falls short on certain aspects.<br /><br />the tutorial only shows you the UI screens and does not show you how to combat.<br />No way to co-ordinate attacks with allies.<br />The AI sucks and will not build you proper units. At one point I had 13 Aircraft carriers being built with no planes and what I needed where ground troops. You will usually always have to control it yourself.<br />Because there is so much to control in the game it can become tedious.<br />I could never figure out how to build more spies and deploy them. It seemed like the entire intelligence aspect did not work.<br />The ships did not seem to support beach invasions at least no way to see if they where.<br />Aircraft attacks never really show any results of their attacks. Half the time they would not continue the mission even when they were set too.<br />The enemy AI also sucks and is not very strategic. It would make stupid suicide attacks instead of attacking tiles it could win. so beating the AI is very easy (on normal difficulty).<br />When ships are under attack it does not let you know until the battle is over showing what ships where sunk.<br />the game itself has everything it needs to be an awesome game if they can clean it up a bit. The game structure is awesome as far as a world wide WWII goes. The detail is really good as far as controlling every aspect as commander in chief and setting up for a world war. From assigning your generals to the combat weather conditions, terrain and even logistical issues with supply and fuel. The game has it all but it needs some serious TLC.
1052	-1	It seems like a waste of money because it doesn't want to download even though I paid for it.  Should<br />come with more help if unable to download
1053	0	This game was advertised for a specific price and the ad said through 10/##/13.  Then the next day when I went to purchase it, the price was up by 4.99, through the same date 10/##/13.  I have seen this many times at Amazon.com.  Do they do this just to piss me off?
1054	0	Omerta is a unique game in the city builder realm, It has city management, along with turn based combat. You manage money, to build an empire, while growing a gang and sending out thugs to help take over the city. The game starts off slow, but quickly gets deeper as you gain in power. You hire thugs to protect your business from Drive-bys, and take overs. You can upgrade your weapons/cars over time, along with leveling up the characters you control. Many different weapon types from pistols, rifles, Tommy guns, or even melee like bats and knives. All of which have vastly different styles/effects. The city management side is on the light side, but the combat is fun and challenging, especially on the higher levels. Recently a new patch has been offered out, that adds a rival gang to run in sandbox mode which is very challenging on the higher settings. If you enjoy the combo city sim/combat, give it a try.. there is a demo but is is basically the first mission tutorial in the campaign. As you get in deeper the game really grows. I have about 40 hours played, and the challenges ramp up as you get deeper.<br /><br />For those hard core players, there is also an iron man mode, which means no in mission saves, combined with the higher difficulties it can lead to real challenges. Send out your crew on a mission that goes bad, half your crew can be beat up really bad, which reduces their effectiveness, a few bad missions, your reign of crime might be over!  Good luck keep the heat off your back!  I'd call the game a solid 3.5, It is easy enough for novices, but has enough difficulty and a fun sandbox to keep you coming back.
1055	-1	I played Konung 2 and enjoyed it much more.. this version has better graphics, but has sacrificed game speed for marginally better graphics.<br /><br />Very disappointing
1056	0	Game is good but the port is absolutely terrible and crashes often.
1057	-1	I am assuming I received the email informing me about this demo because I had preordered the game for Mac. Why send this to me if I can't download it? I know there are plenty of Mac Sims players out there; you would think they would make it available for both platforms since the games are always WinMac
1058	0	I've been a huge fan of the Might & Magic series ever since I played the first game back in the 1980's.  This legacy version does a really good job of recapturing the feeling of playing the Word of Xeen tile-based game, which was always my favorite from the series.  The updated graphics are fun, and the skills system works well.  But this game has a few drawbacks in my opinion.  First, and most importantly, there are two major bugs that have been an issue for me and others.  The first is that occasionally the game will lock-up and not allow my characters to move.  Everything else works, but cannot move.  Have to close and restart the game to fix it.  Happens often enough that it's an issue.  Second major bug is that the rendered scenes while using a store are very unnecessarily graphics card intensive and cause my card to get very hot quickly.  Just a matter of poor programming on their end.  The last issue is more of a nuisance of game play for me:  It seems that, at least in the beginning, there is too much time spend running back to the town to buy more food.  This is due to the amount of time that passes between tiles.  Going what should be relatively small distances results in the party getting tired and needing to rest.  Mana runs out too quickly in the beginning too, also increasing the need to rest.  As a result, I've had to run back to town while in the middle of what should be an easy dungeon.  Also, it's a bit hard to understand what gear to choose to equip.  It's not clear on what is more effective: AC vs Resistance.  An increase in 1 AC can also result in -12 to attack value.  How can 1 AC really be worth that??  Confusing, to say the least.  But from what I understand, the game is new, and they are still working out some of the bugs.  I'm happy they made the game, but wished they released it a month or two later after they fixed the bugs instead of making us pay for what should be a beta copy.  A for effort.
1059	0	While in the middle of the game, a window pops up saying it has encountered a problem and has to close.  Very aggravating!
1060	1	It was really good because you don't have to pay more for this kind of product and received my code pretty fast
1061	1	Just when you think a game can't get any better, they dropped this expansion!  Cultural victories had become the easiest way to win before this expansion.  Now, there's a decent challenge no matter which road you choose!  A must have!!
1062	0	This is a fun side-scrolling shooter game. But be warned, at times it feels like a simple flash game and gets pretty repetitive fairly quick. Nonetheless, if you can pick this game up for around $1 like I did, it's well worth your money!
1063	0	Was gonna buy it on sale at 33$, great price as before it was 45$<br />Get home and the price is 55$ for a digital copy? Doesn't make any sense that the digital is more then the physical copy.<br />The game itself is great, need friends to play with or it becomes a grind fest until level 30 (which really doesn't take long but still)<br />The only issue i have with the game is you only get 5 character slots while there are 8 classes, and the only way to get more is to pay even more out of pocket! I already payed 55$ why not let me enjoy all the game?
1064	-1	Don't waste your download/personal time!!!! Need I say MORE? I guess I Have to, because the word counter below is making me... That is stupid!
1065	-1	It is sad how badly this game was ruined.
1066	0	"I like this game but is nearly identical to \\""1701\\"".<br />I would feel I wasted my money except that this was a download and<br />easier to access than getting my \\""1701\\"" disc out etc<br /><br />Download and install: no difficulties; program runs fine too<br />My system is getting out of date and still no problems.<br />It downlaoded fast with my broadband etc<br /><br />UPLAY: fortunately I all ready have a number of titles on UPLAY; this platform is usually<br />problem free and not over-intrusive etc<br /><br />I would recommend this for fans of this type of game.<br />I would have given 4 stars, but it is just a near twin of \\""1701\\"" etc<br /><br />Depending on how you custimize the difficulties level and various play options, this<br />game can be mellow and relaxing or difficult etc<br />Enjoy"
1067	1	UPLAY IS NOT THAT BAD. GET OVER IT. Okay seriously, everyone said the same thing about Steam when it first came out, and now look at it: everybody's darling. Uplay works fine. And for DRM, it's leaps and bounds beyond SecuROM. Also I've always liked the Upoint system where occasional achievements give you access to Mp3s, wallpapers, and in game toys like an extra gun or car. It's fun. Do I like the idea of double DRM? No, not really, but that's the reality of the situation, and Uplay could be way worse. As it stands it's just Ubisoft wanting to get in on what all the cool kids are doing. And who knows, Origin is getting better every day. Uplay could eventually get good enough to rival Steam. I mean probably not. But maybe.<br /><br />No, wait! Don't go away! I am actually going to talk about the game! Now Far Cry 3's pedigree is above-average at best. Far Cry and its expansions were fun, but brief and not that memorable. And Far Cry 2 played with some cool ideas sure, and hey, the Springfield was easily my favorite rifle in any game EVER, but it got boring and tedious fast and it could be brick stupid at times. Far Cry 3 takes the best from both games and adds some nice ideas from Assassin's Creed and Crysis, and it all boils down to easily the most enjoyable sandbox from Ubisoft I've ever played. The guns are bonkers fun, and though the plot is lackluster and some things could be said about its use of questionable subjects like race, rape, and poor writing, that's all amended by some amazingly fun shooter gameplay. Optional side missions encourage the use of multiple play styles, while the cream of the game--the base takeovers, of which there are a ton (and which can also be reset in the post-game for infinite fun)--allow you to take practically any lead-slinging approach you see fit. I usually sifted heads with a silenced R700 before switching to a Black Arrow with a tear in my eye, but occasionally I got down and dirty with a silenced Makarov and tanto. And if sniping's not your thing (though sadly neither the useless SVD, the R700, or the inclusion of an explosive-tipped Black Arrow ever surpass the superior experience of FC2's M1903 Springfield) then feel free to go in gloriously with LMGs, shotguns, and large-caliber handguns.<br /><br />Definitely try if you like sandbox games and shooters.<br /><br />As for the multiplayer... it's serviceable, but nowhere near approaching a game-changer, and personally I enjoyed the single-player far too much to bother with what amounts to a COD clone marred by less arcade-y movement.
1068	1	Play it several times a date. enjoying the games very much.
1069	1	Well, its another chapter in the console port story.  Sleeping Dogs is worthy of its growing reputation as an interesting, semi open world, wander through the city story.  It is not GTA, or Saints Row, nor does it pretend to be.  Its a cool story about organized crime in Hong Kong (one of my favorite places on earth), the cops, and the city.<br /><br />It takes a while to get into the story, as well as get going into the gameplay.  I always am suspicious of games that require lots of tutorials, and Sleeping Dogs has some, but probably needs more.  Like Assassins Creed, the PC controls require a deft touch, which is usually ok with me.  I always assume that I'll have to get used to the controls to be most effective with the style of gameplay that the designers thought about when building the game.<br /><br />I usually like fighting games (Batman Arkham City/Asylum are some of my all time faves in this genre), and Sleeping Dogs has plenty in droves.  Unfortunately, its another example of combo mouse clicks, perfect timing, and all sorts of other things that are hard to control.  The original Witcher had a unique method of controlling mouse timing and movement, but once you got used to it, it was terrific and made the game super fun.<br /><br />This game though, is far less fun, as the combo button pushes, as well as other combo keys, make it hard to handle the fights, especially in groups.  You can usually get through them, but its far from enjoyable gamepley.  The driving and gunplay are fine, less annoying.<br /><br />My single biggest annoyance is the PC method used for guiding the character.  Its part mouse, part Left/Right keys.  It makes accurate running nearly impossible, where you are trying to get somewhere, either in a chase or in a fight, and you end up somewhere completely different.  Its truly borked, and makes absolutely zero sense.  I guess the developers never bothered playing with a PC....<br /><br />In conclusion, its another sad story of console-itis, as well as awkward control decisions in the first place.  I'm sure these subtle problems could be fixed with a patch that would allow the character control to actually work, but we'll see if the Square Enix and the devs actually get around to it.
1070	-1	skip this and all Paradox games they all suck
1071	-1	I thought this was a good game to buy and download because I like to shoot pool and it's compatible with my Windows 7 PC. After downloading it, I was surprised to find out that I couldn't shoot the cue ball hard enough to break the balls up. I've tried hours trying to figure out why I couldn't apply any speed or force to the cue ball when making a shot. For some reason the directions that were displayed didn't work the way they were supposed to. In other words, I just think I ended up wasting my time and money on a game that doesn't even work properly.
1072	1	My daughter introduced me to a game on Facebook called Hidden Object Game and I was hooked. However, I don't like playing games on Facebook. So I went to Amazon to see if they had similar games that I could download. They did, the hardest part was deciding which one to get. I read other reviews (which were very helpful) and chose Deadtime Stories. I like vampires, ghosts, and cemeteries so this seemed like the game for me. It was a real challenge! I have played the game 3 times now and it is different every time. Maybe it is my advancing age, but there is so much going on in this game that I can't remember every little thing and it makes it challenging all over again! I love the game and would recommend it.
1073	-1	For all of the glitz and glam Amazon adds to the OGPlanet product not to mention the thought of Gundam I am utterly disappointed with the fact the game can not be played in a browser or some other cross platform media. Come on this is the the tech time of more than one OS. It would make sense Amazon would partner with group that would do more than Windows games with cumbersome installers and ui's. Plus the product does not work in 64bit environments.
1074	-1	Have to agree with another poster. I wont download another game. Only CD/DVD going forward. If this is your first try at flying, don't buy this game. You'll need a lot of experience with complex settings. I've worked with this one for a couple weeks and I'm still frustrated. Game will be removed from my PC soon.<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn't all that happy with the graphics or the flight controls. Trying to see targets and steer towards them, forget it.<br /><br />Very frustrating game controls and cockpit options. No map, no idea where you're headed.
1075	1	Really, nice games for an excellent price. All steamworks. 5 games for only 9.99, if you have a discount coupon, 4.99.
1076	1	Great price for a years worth of XBL..  Will probably get another when this expires...Still think some services should be standard without XBL but that's another post...
1077	0	I didn't buy from Amazon, but bought from Steam.  This a review of the game, and not the delivery.  After being a Homeworld fan for many years, I was ecstatic that someone had picked up the gauntlet to reenergize the franchise.  Unfortunately, Gearbox dropped the ball on this one, by releasing to soon, without fixing the bugs.  Mass salvage operations no longer operational.  One must micromanage each salvager to each target.  Buggy to non existent repair frigate operations, as in repair frigates will not repair 80% of the time. Aggressive to evasive tactics useless.  Flight formations useless.  Hot keys aren't the best.  I think Gearbox, got tunnel vision on this one.  The biggest thing aside from graphics is playability.<br />I mean come on, they had the game in front of them.  All the ingredients, a road map just to build upon.  The game feels unfinished and rushed to release.  This game should have been much better.  I prefer the original over this one any day.  What good are graphics if the playability mechanics don't work.  Patch Patch Patch!!!!!!!!!  Unfortunately, that's the way things are going.  The game is not completed, and I can't stand paying hard earned money for things that aren't as advertised.
1078	1	This is a phenomenal game that will provide many hours of enjoyment to FPS and action/RPG fans. I reviewed it at length on GeeksUnderGrace.com here:<br /><br />http://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/borderlands-2-game-year-edition-pc/
1079	0	I was enjoying the story even though the hidden objects took some getting used to.  The game stopped working.  All there was when I clicked on an area were sparkles.  Deleted and reloaded several times but it wouldn't move forward.  I finally deleted it and went on to another game.
1080	-1	Didnt work. Had to contact R* Support for help.
1081	0	Long story short, its ok at best. You get all the maps, but its still too similar to BF BC 2! And multilayer is ruled by an army of children that make custom games minus most of the fun weapons. They boot you for using them, so I troll alot!<br /><br />If the price was 20$, it would be much more worth it. Though, its hard to overlook the fact that its basically bad company 2, with new maps. I mainly play armored kill, and caspian border as they seem the funnest. For a better value, I would just get those maps!<br /><br />The bottom line: if your extremely tired of duty, and you've picked up field; buy the individual maps, if you must.....
1082	1	Work as expected.<br />Nice and smooth buy this card from Amazon to use on PSN. Thank you very much.<br />Bests.
1083	0	I purchased the first STH4 here on Amazon a while back. I installed it, played approximately 10 minutes of it, then uninstalled the game, and asked for a refund. Amazon obliged me, and I never touched it again. I grabbed this one when it went on sale, and played a bit. It's honestly bearable, not great, but it's worth playing if you can grab it on sale, and if you like the classic Sonic titles. It has some interesting gameplay mechanics, and I plan to play more of it.
1084	0	The game is incredibly atmospheric and immersive, but it drags on, and the fact that you spend most of the game hiding in cabinets makes it get boring kinda fast
1085	0	loved darkness 2 and borderlands duke was not so impressive this round..........
1086	0	I love it but there needs to be more of it. I have played it about 20 times all the way through and now know were everything is. Would love to have more of this.
1087	1	everything seemed fine. buy and download is safe ,trusted and fast. hotel giant 2 is a great game.I love it.
1088	1	I downloaded this about a month ago. I have a Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium computer and I was scared to download this at first because of all the reviews saying it didn't work on Windows 7. But I needed something to play on my PC since my Sims 3 game completely stopped working on me and began freezing my computer.<br /><br />I had no issues downloading and it only took about thirty minutes. It starts everytime, saves games fine, and runs just like how I remember when I played it in elementary school.<br /><br />If you haven't played the game before, essentially the idea is to complete objectives set out for each park with certain restrictions and obstacles. for example, build a park with only wooden rollercoasters. Then you have to manage the money, rides, employees and the highly annoying customers. You can build roller coasters, gentle rides, and water rides from scratch; most thrill rides are not customizable. Also, with this pack there are a lot of park options ranging from beginner, challenging, and expert. Then also, you can build your own six flag parks.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with my purchase and glad I went out on a limb and downloaded it.
1089	-1	I waited to purchase, hoping that the launch issues I'd read about would be cleared up.  Well long waits and instability continue.<br /><br />As to the game itself, while I admit that it's very pretty, I miss all of the things I most loved about Sim City.  I miss being able to terrafarm, and create regions from tiny to huge - with raging rivers or tall mountains, or whatever I was in the mood for.  I miss downloading the incredible buildings and cities that fellow users (who have more talent than me!) created and shared.  I miss creating cities based on humor, or beauty, or historical value, rather than on a budget.  What I don't miss is worrying about whether my internet connection or EA servers will get moody and spontaneously destroy everything I just spent hours creating.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  If you're new to Sim City, then instead download SimCity 4 for $15 [[ASIN:B00457VJ3G SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download]]]  Then go to Simtropolis.com and download all the extras you want, without paying EA another dime.
1090	1	I wasn't around in the glory days of arcades, but I am familiar with the game from a TV plug'n'play I had previously.  Dig Dug was one of my favorite games on the console, and when the console broke, I was forlorn.  But atlas! I found a PC Dig Dug on Amazon!  This game has everything I love about Dig Dug!  If you've played this game before, you will instantly recognize the gameplay.  Now, if only there was a new Super Pac-Man for PCs!
1091	1	I would pay the same for only one of the games, and it even includes DLC!<br />I wanted this games for so long, and then this perfect offer came!
1092	0	Too many keyboard keys to maneuver makes for difficult play.
1093	1	Galactic Civilizations III (GalCiv3) is a turn based strategy game where you start from a single solar system and set out to prove your superiority by conquest, cultural influence, technological advancement, ascension to a higher plane of existence, diplomacy or best score after 1,000 turns. You can turn victory conditions on or off at any time in the game.  You can play randomly set up maps ranging in size from small to insane with anywhere from one AI opponent to one hundred opponents! The game comes with eight major and six minor AI opponents; however, you can design your own custom opponents or download player designed opponents from the Internet.  There are a large variety of variables that you can set up before starting  a game which ensures that every game you play will be different. If you tire of beating up the AI opponents you can also join a multi-player (MP) game online. At the time of this review, when you play multi-player, you can only have up to four major AI and four human opponents and cannot use the largest map sizes.  The game is only available in English now; however, French, German and Russian versions are due out this summer, possibly as early as June. [Follow-up: The French, German and Russian versions were released in June 2015 as promised.]  The game is strategic in orientation and, as such, there is no player controlled tactical combat. You design your ships and determine what weapons and defenses they carry; however, the game system takes over when rival ships meet. You also determine how you will invade and defend planets but the game system handles the actual invasions.  The initial release version of the game has limited diplomacy. You can trade with AI players once every 15 turns but can trade with human players every turn. The AI can make demands upon your empire; however, you cannot make demands upon the AI. The developers say this will change later this summer. [Follow-up: No change on this; however, the developers say we will getthis in February 2016.]  A major oversight in the game is that it will lock up once you have completed all the technology research that is available. Until this is fixed by the developers you have to slow down your pace of technology research and eventually stop all research if you aren't attempting to achieve a technology victory. For this reason I give the game four out of five stars.
1094	1	Bioshock is one of the best games of the generation. Spec Ops tells a story in an interesting way, even if the gameplay holds it back. Those two games, if you haven't played them, easily make this bundle worth every penny.<br /><br />Bioshock 2, however, is a load of garbage, and you should avoid it at all costs. That, of course, doesn't take away from how great the other two games are, but it holds the bundle back from being 5 stars, as far as I'm concerned.
1095	0	I love HOG games and have played a ton of them. I thought this was too short and at times it didn't make sense what you needed to do. I also must have missed something in the story line because the ending was rather.... lame. Just my opinion. If you want a HOG with a tiny bit of adventure, then this is good. It's just too short of a game for me.
1096	0	The Arkham games are great fun, even if i hate Harleys costume in Arkham! If you haven't played these games you should go ahead and pick this up and have fun!
1097	-1	No Serial Number is provided... I cannot play this game without this code.. I tried to purchase it additionally, but the website is not working...
1098	1	convienent
1099	-1	After a couple of initial missions in the story mode I continually received the standard DirectX error others are seeing. Check this thread: [...] before you bother to buy so it's not a waste of money.
1100	0	It says that the demo is only available on windows. ):
1101	0	Fun game BUT<br />If you buy it, be prepared to download 22.7GB!!<br />Due to my Verizon bandwidth limiting, it took 3 days with the computer running 24 hours to complete the download!<br />Also note that you MUST deal with the Origin login EVERY time you want to play it.
1102	0	I was happy to find that the codes I purchased unlocked the games on Steam and added them to my Steam library. I can download these games whenever I want using the steam client I am already familiar with.
1103	1	Every single month they give us new games, for free!!!! Hitman, Ucharted3, Little big planet karting, Battlefield 3 , batman, vanquish, deux ex, etc
1104	1	I like tits, and this game is the tits.  I would say the best part of this product would be the nipple.
1105	1	I used this to teach farming in home schooling. It worked out really well. This is not a really detailed simulation. The physics can be a bit wonky at times, but that's what you get for going where no tractor has gone before.
1106	-1	DO NOT BUY ANY COD - STEAM AND ACTIVISION are a match for each other. I have not been able to play Call of Duty Black Ops II SINCE I UPDATED my computer. STEAM and ACTIVISION are unreachable, unavailable and unaccountable.  I would like to know how to return this game and receive either a functional version, or an updated version or my money back. This is the only game MY COMPUTER will not play. It always gives me a blue screen.  My rig has a FX 8150 processor , 16 GB memory, 1000 w PS and a R9 290x video card.
1107	0	Adds a little to the Civilization franchise, but probably not enough to tell a big difference by most inveterate Civ 5 players
1108	1	This helped me buy my first game on PS store, and it was really fast and easy to buy :)
1109	1	I love all the extras in the game but the city takes a long time to load on my computer
1110	1	passes time beautifully, fun grafics, good for detective workl, irritates my husband wonderfully because I'm busy doing something without him! (This last part was in fun because I couldn't think of anything more to say about the product)
1111	1	Getting an emailed code and it worked perfectly
1112	1	Great Game!!!!!!!<br />I Have Great 2015 Pc Games Titles, Windows 8.1 pro Keys, Xbxox One cards, All On Sale PayPal Accepted!!<br />www.buypckeys.com<br /><br />Pre Order Fallout 4 Now
1113	-1	why would you region lock codes and not let the owner of the account change the region as he pleased<br /><br />as i played it, i was amazed at how many things they did worse than ffxi
1114	-1	This is not properly represented and does not fit in the traditional understanding of a 'hidden object' game. Maybe my standards are different; however,  did not find this entertaining at all. Sometimes you don't know that until it's too late.
1115	1	the pack was 9$ usd when i bought it and man was it worth it, i love these games and you hopefully will to, but they are hard as all hell.
1116	-1	[...]    Save $10 and buy it there....    What is the deal? Amazon is supposed to be cheaper, right? I bought the game. Went to download it from Origin.... download this installer which has a link to another installer where I created account to install the installer from them. Then it shows the exact same game to download and it was $10 cheaper than the 'supposed' most-excellent sales price at Amazon. Bollocks!
1117	0	Somewhat interesting content. More story in the expansion than the whole vanilla game. There isn't enough content to really justify paying for just the first expansion. Hopefully the second expansion has more to it.
1118	0	I would have loved to give 5 stars but I have been having issues with amazon customer service and downloading late night on my new computer. The Sims 3 Late Night is Windows 7 compatible. Yet when I called they said its for Vista and XP.  As far as the game goes its great. Never buying a game download from amazon again though. The only reason I did is because it was cheaper than origin.
1119	0	I started playing this on the free game section of yahoo and liked it well enough to purchase it. It's entertaining for when you don't have much else to do (rainy day type stuff). It has no real challenges but is sort of like a slot machine. I use it at least 3 times a week so it is addictive. This is better for kids under 13 in my opinion.
1120	1	What I expected
1121	1	Code was emailed very quickly, beats running to the store to purchase.  Only thing preventing 5 stars is the fact that you can do this right over Xbox live for the same price.  Plus for those who wish to not enter payment options on xbox.
1122	1	Exelente
1123	0	Game is cool for a neat airport game.  Graphics are ok, game gets a bit laggy in the fire station.  Takes a while to actually upgrade to the fire truck you see on the game cover.  Pretty neat though, we like it
1124	0	It's an OK product.  I was looking for video poker compatable with Windows 7.  It was the best I could find.  It's technology is a little dated.
1125	-1	First of all, I am a big fan of strategic games, but this game is terrible.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- none<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- HORRIBLE graphics.<br />- Very shallow story line.<br />- Feels like a game made for windows 95 not windows xp/7<br />- Way too expensive ($14.99)<br /><br />This game is the biggest rip off in the world.<br />DO NOT BUY this game if you want good quality gameplay and a return on your money.
1126	1	Another good edition to The Midnight Mystery series. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are a fan of the series like me it won't disappoint. I hope they keep making them.Great way to pass the time,decent storyline and graphics and I love the bonus finds which unlock the unlimited play.
1127	-1	Confused thought I was getting a game download
1128	0	"This is a matching game.  The \\""host\\"" of the game, the granny looks a little creepy and makes weird sounds.  I got this game so I could get ideas for real quilts, and it has helped a little.  It I hadn't had a coupon, i would not have purchased it.  If you are looking for entertainment, i would suggest another game."
1129	0	The game is amazing at single player, the story and visual quality are very impressive, but there's almost no one on the multiplayer networks. So basically, it cant be multiplayer when you are standing alone on the servers.
1130	0	Like most casual games, To-Fu 2 is a great little distraction, but after a while it gets to be boring.
1131	0	If you did't play the first one on Xbox you will not like this.<br />The first one was amazing, but as always the sequel can<br />never hold up to our standards. This game is for die hard<br />Mercenaries fans only.
1132	1	i ordered the membership and they gave me the code right after. It was just what i wanted and it was for a great price.
1133	1	When the game came out, there was tons of problems with the server. Now all these are fixed and anybody can play anytime.<br />Now the game is really fun. When I first got it, I played it for about six hours strait.<br />Only complain is that city size is too small and if you build a city so large, it will just collapse on itself.
1134	0	"This game has brilliant and exciting graphics and easily understandable navigation of town structures.  There is no User's Manual (there is a UK manual version, but it is next to useless) to help guide the Player through the process of buying, selling, and transferring of commodities/goods from ship-to-shore or vice versa.  I purchased and religiously played Port Royale 1 (PR1).  The PR1 User's Manual and mercantile process and loading/unloading procedures where simple and straight forward.  Somewhere along the development effort to PR3, the simplicity of the entire mercantile process fell to wayside.  Many earlier AMAZON User Review Comments noted the difficulty and frustrating mercantile process that I have noted above.  Some finally figured it out, but ultimately became part of the problem and not the solution because they did not reveal what and how they discovered how to resolve the issue for future purchase players.  I have actually discovered how too actually buy and occasionally sell commodities/goods, but the latter is a hit or miss proposition.  Commodities/goods are bought and sold in the Town's DOCK structure.  At least in the AMAZON downloadable version I purchased, you find the particular commodity/good(s) desired on the left hand side of the pop-up window and double Left Mouse Button (LMB) click of the item icon.  A smaller pop-up window for the desired commodity/ good(s) will appear.  A slider bar at the bottom edge of this window will allow you to buy and transfer or sell and transfer the number of the desired commodity/good(s).  Here is the rub!!,... there is no obvious or objectively consistent process to finalize the purchase or sell.  To dramatically improve the entire mercantile process and thus the playability and enjoyment of the entire game, KOLYPSO MEDIA should immediately create a patch and aggressively communicate the \\""How to (or fix process/ procedure\\"" via their Newsletter, Player Forums, and/or individualized e-mails to individual PR3 Purchasers.  If they do this, they very well may dramatically improve sells of PR3, but increase the number of \\""Stars\\"" for this product.  If you actually figure out how to affect the purchase/sell transfers, which automatically closes the smaller desired commodity/good(s) pop-up window (or as in my case somehow, accidentally complete and close the window), you are off and running in the Merchant-side of things and ready to sail-off for greater glory.  If for some reason you ultimately desire not to buy or sell this particular commodity/good(s), then simply double Right Mouse Button (RTB) click to exit the smaller pop-up window.  Repeat the above purchase/sell process on the main commodities/ goods pop-up window.  Everything else about PR3 is a dramatic improvement over previous PR versions.  PR3 is more than worth the purchase and the playing adventure on the high seas."
1135	-1	I have a 2011 iMac. I installed it, followed all the directions regarding the order of inputting the serial number and updating. Never worked. Opened to a black screen, never changed. I tried everything I could think of - it never worked. I wanted to like this, despite the lukewarm reviews. But this game simply does not work for macs<br /><br />Fortunately, I emailed Amazon about this and they gave me a complete refund. So 5 stars for excellent customer support on Amazons part. 1 star for actual game. DO NOT BUY.
1136	0	I could not get the he troobles to follow me, but they are cute. Look like buck-toothed guinea pigs.lol. They are safe in my massive inventory.
1137	0	I thought that the game will go on as long as u dont loose but I was wrong it does have an end and I won!! Yay
1138	-1	Gameplay from 1995. Graphics from 2000.
1139	-1	crappy graphics, strange action, mediocre descriptions of rules and few options for more or less challenging play.
1140	1	good
1141	0	This is not a bad game for the series i really like hidden object games  you need to have more of a selection
1142	-1	After so many iterations of the game, is it arrogant to think it would have more details and features? The game doesn't even have on-ramps for traffic alleviation or the feature to micromanage a city if you wanted. Instead, it's the same broad general overseeing of a city. It's a snore-fest after the first hour of playing.
1143	0	not as challenging as expected but still ok. downloaded without a problem. worth the money. fun to play. that's all
1144	0	It's a very well crafted game but tends to pull you along as you literally follow an arrow navigator to go from encounter to encounter.  Somewhat repetitive too.  Quite frankly I still prefer System Shock most of all and the first Bio Shock after that.  This game is borderline boring.  I gave it 3 stars mainly because the graphics are so well done.
1145	0	Lol
1146	-1	They force there advertising down your throat and slow your computer up.
1147	-1	This software won't download so I can't review it how ever it keep's saying not available at this time! Very frustrasting.
1148	-1	If you're thinking of buying this, take heed and use caution. I purchased this game when it became available, and I'm quite sorry I did.<br /><br />The game depends on unreliable servers to facilitate play, which means you can only launch it if conditions at the EA sever farm are optimal. On top of that, your game progress will likely be inexplicably erased due to server woes.<br /><br />Do not buy - learn from me!
1149	0	"Soldak Entertainment is great at making quirky little action-RPGs (ARPG -- click on monsters until they die, loot, repeat.  You know, like Diablo, or Torchlight).  Drox Operative is Soldak's first whack at a science-fiction ARPG.  Instead of the usual intrepid hero, your alter ego in the game is a spaceship zipping around a set of generic space sectors.  Instead of swords and armor and other Ye Olde Fare, you loot and equip lasers, shields, energy banks, exotic crew, and the like.  As a part of the mysterious Drox Operatives, your job in the game is basically to find new and exciting aliens, kill them (or not; see below), and take their stuff.<br /><br />There's pretty much a 1:1 correlation between what goes on in your typical fantasy RPG and Drox Operative; in fact, most folks who are familiar with Soldak's games call Drox Operative \\""Din's Quest in Space\\"".  DQ was Soldak's previous game, a bog-standard fantasy RPG with the twist of having taken place in a world that didn't wait for the player -- NPCs would go quests on their own (and get in trouble), monster bosses would work proactively to make life harder for everyone, quests would be dynamically generated based on what was going on in the world at that time, and the like.  The same kind of stuff goes on in Drox (alien races will colonize planets you discover, squabble amongst themselves, send you out to kill new threats, etc.)  The player can form treaties with aliens, trade with them, blow up their home worlds, and otherwise make a nuisance of themselves.<br /><br />In the end, though, you get your usual time-worn ARPG mechanics with middling production values.  If you're burned out on click-and-looters, you probably won't find Drox Operative very interesting.  If you're still interested in the genre, Drox's \\""living world\\"" might keep you entertained."
1150	1	Excellent initiative from Amazon to sell games and cards in digital format. I bought my digital cards easily and quickly. Excellent service, thank your customers, I recommend to all my friends. Thank you.
1151	1	Quick Activation, No problem, The code came to my email in a few seconds, very secure. This card is awsome
1152	-1	couldn't get to work.
1153	0	Fun game...however, having to use both the mouse controls as well as the traditional WASD keys can get very annoying; not to mention that you have to use the W key to jump. Overall the story line is good.
1154	1	The latest incarnation of Far Cry, is not just a game, but an experience. No other game of its kind has a story like this one. Seems like a movie that you ultimately get to decide the ending of... If there are any bad reviews being written about this game, I would hope that they are about the installation. As with any PC game, it requires am immense amount of supplemental prerequisites from Microsoft. If you encounter any issues with ANYTHING regarding errors, just reinstall/repair the supplements.<br />You will LOVE FC3 if you like: Grand Theft Auto, CoD, Minecraft, Assassins Creed, etc. SPECTACULAR plot, relate able characters, and a variety of fun activities make the replay value exceedingly large.
1155	-1	The performance is horrible.  I can run most modern games with out an issue but this has horrible mouse latency and runs very poor.
1156	0	A lot of people praise these games, and its easy to see why. Unfortunately i just cant get into them. the controls and movement just doesn't feel right, and the combat, at least in my opinion feels off.
1157	-1	great game, ported terribly, not worth 1$ on pc with all the issues caused by incomplete port work. Buy on console, not on PC.
1158	1	lets see, i bought this game when it was on sale which happens rarely, and boy is this game fun. i thought it would be boring, but when i started to play it, it was nice to get high scores, and to play the next levels. the game has 3 different settings to play, i wont say, don't want to ruin the game.
1159	-1	I like the picture but I haven't been able to get past level 1 because the objects are too hidden for me.
1160	1	the code work great and i didnt have any problem.. i recommend it XD<br /><br />about this soccer is beautiful and great to take your favorite team to change with other buddies online
1161	1	Ok
1162	1	It was easy and fast ot purchase the online game code. Great way to get around the problems that sometimes occur in Xbox market place.
1163	0	3,5 stars.<br /><br />Any fan of the previous games will probably like this one, and It IS a nice game, but I couldn¬¥t help but feel annoyed over the puzzles that were just too simple. You can basically rush thru this game in two hours or less.<br />It quickly became apparent that solving puzzles was basically the &#34;open-the-drawer-beside-the-safe-to-get-the-key-to-open-the-safe&#34; type of thing. If you get stuck it will probably be because you missed searching some corner or shelf for an object to pick up. Or how about this example from the game: You break into some kind of lab where there¬¥s a safe. You¬¥d expect the safe to contain som extraordinary device or information. Instead you find a hammer..  It felt really cheap to say the least.<br /><br />BUT.. not getting stuck easily can also be something positive. For me, I took the game more as a movie where I didn¬¥t really have to think too much, and it was a pleasant amusement.
1164	-1	It just wasn't as fun. Didn't load like I thought it should and the game was small.
1165	1	Perfect !
1166	0	Fairly challenging and a option to play single player, campaign, or multiplayer.  So far I have done single player and campaign  I must admit I haven't won the first challenge in the campaign and I'm wondering why.  I have explored everything and put in stations at all the resources and the only other town and have over $200K and yet no win.  I'm sure I will figure it out but the game is enjoyable and the graphics and sound are decent.  The view is from overhead and you can't zoom in close up for view of trains with backgrounds.  I hope to find a good train game with better graphics where you can do a close up side view of the trains.  The economics are okay but it isn't my main reason for playing a train game.  Please comment if you know of a train game that is more about viewing and operating than fighting economic battles and constantly monitoring all the trains.  My idea would be to have an auto mode once I set a train on a route and not monitor its maintenance and route constantly.<br /><br />CA Luster
1167	0	I loved the Sims 2 university game. This one seems like a lot of effort for not a lot of reward. It was too hard to keep your grades up and still be able to socialize. I could uninstall it and not miss a thing.
1168	-1	This year's entire game product has been awful. This purported season pass does not include all scheduled DLC & the majority of the playable &#34;characters&#34; you get are nothing but &#34;different&#34; versions of characters aleady included in the base game. This is definitely the last time I ever purchase the season pass & probably the last time I buy a WWE game for the foreseeable future.
1169	-1	Yuck!<br />Not the type of game I expected it to be when I bought it.  I should have been more diligent in researching it.
1170	1	I downloaded this game after I played the 2011 Plainswalker DLC. I was pleasantly surprised to see the changes the made in 2012 giving you three different realms in which to test your dueling skills. The fact that Multiplayer is there made this game worth every penny to me. You start the game with just a basic deck and gain some after defeating opponents or you can purchase complete decks on the downloadable site. I have spent many hours enjoying the different opponents and their dueling styles. I give this 4 starts and not 5 because it was over in about 12 hours. Bear in mind that is playing without buying the constructed decks. Hope this helps.
1171	-1	I bought this game because I loved Slingo Hawaii.  I was disappointed because there is no challenge in this game once you earn all of the benefit coins.  It took about one hour to earn them.  After that the challenge was gone.<br /><br />There are three ways to play; the daily challenge, Supreme, and regular.  The regular is not a full game, only one level.  The challenge is OK (which is why I gave it 2 stars) because you are up against the highest score of the day.  So somewhat of a challenge.<br /><br />Too much of a challenge is nerve wracking and no challenge is boring.
1172	1	Works perfectly had no problems. Redeeming the code was easy. After you purchase the code you get the code fast and you get the option to get it emailed to you.
1173	0	Not as good as the original Dark Souls, but still a decent experience overall.
1174	0	a decent game for the price. Graphic is okay, not super good like Half Life 2. Game play is average. Worth the money though. It's easy to get used to this game if you've played Half Life 2 before.
1175	0	I am posting this review here because I could not find an appropriate place on ESOs' forums to do so.  I did not purchase ESO for my PC from Amazon.  Although, I am purchasing it for my Xbox One from Amazon. :)  This review is my opinion only, yours may differ.<br /><br />Let me start off by defining my play style.  I play mostly solo and only group up if I want to tackle a big boss.  The reason for this is because my agenda very rarely matches anybody elses agenda and I would rather play my game than someone elses.  I truly believe this is the most popular play style.  I enjoy doing quests and avoid grinding if I can.  I do not play PVP.<br /><br />I am going to do this review in two parts.  Part 1 will be the things I like about ESO.  Part 2 will be the things I do not like.<br /><br />THE THINGS I LIKE.<br /><br />The devs have kept ESO with the look and feel of all the previous Elder Scrolls game.  I was very happy to see that.<br /><br />I like the graphics.  They are really excellent and in my opinion they look nothing like Rift.<br /><br />I like the quests.  They are cleverly put together and are a lot of fun.  It seems like you are really involved in them as each quest giver is asking you to do something he/she needs to have done and it usually makes sense with the story in general.  There are puzzles as well as combat.<br /><br />I like to walk around and listen to all the conversations going on.  Every once in awhile an NPC will say hello, berate you, or talk bad about your family.. ha ha.  It really feels like the game is alive. Sometimes. if you talk back to them.. they will give you a little side quest.<br /><br />So, all in all the game is well put together for the most part.  I would recommend buying ESO.  Even though it is a little bumpy right now, I know it will get better.<br /><br />THE THINGS I DON'T LIKE.<br /><br />There are not a lot ,but a few things do irritate me.<br /><br />The quests are not carefully thought out as far as level relevance.  A beginner has to be very careful to be sure they are not sent off to an area 3 or 4 times higher than they should be in.<br /><br />The beginning quest in a quest chain, should alert you to the fact that you may not be able to complete the chain solo.  They do not do a good job of making the player aware of this.  So, you may spend an hour or so doing a quest chain, only to find out that you cannot finish it solo.<br /><br />There are not enough solo quests in an area.  So, you often can find yourself out of quests in your level range before you are ready to move on to a higher area.  What this does is cause the player to have to grind out a level or so.<br /><br />Some of the bosses are a bit difficult to handle at level.  I believe these quests are actually group quests, but the player is not aware of this until they reach the final boss.<br /><br />The game crashes every so often.. Not a lot, but when it happens it is sort of annoying.  This is the case with many new MMOs, so probably cannot fault the devs for this.  They just need to get these bugs ironed out quickly.<br /><br />My final opinion is that ESO is going to be one of the better games on the Market.  I am having fun playing it and it looks like I will for some time to come.e.  A beginner has to be very careful to be sure they are not sent off to an area 3 or 4 times higher than they should be in.<br /><br />The beginning quest in a quest chain, should alert you to the fact that you may not be able to complete the chain solo.

1176	0	I have always loved Humungous games.  My only dislike of this version of Putt- Putt goes to the Moon is the picture/graphics is not as clear as it could be.
1177	0	It was okay but i like one more because i could quit the game and come back later and pickup where i left off!
1178	-1	Generally, I like the game. The hugh exception to that is when the players split a pot, the game freezes.  No amount of mouse clicking will restart the game. I have to Control, Alt, Delete and reboot the computer and then start all over.  The Telltale websight does not address this issue.
1179	1	Very nice but the site must be great if the payment add paypal for people outside the us, for example Mexico.
1180	-1	Awful. Supposed to work on windows. Not ..
1181	1	My autistic 11 year old grandson is a computer whiz who loves to play and download games to his PS3. What better birthday gift for him? His comment: Super, Nana, just super!! That made my day and his!!  Easy to order and fast delivery to his mom.
1182	-1	How come everybody complains the duplicate code but Amazon keeps selling these garbage code to customers??? I thought I can play the game immediately after I pay the digit version but I am wrong this time....
1183	-1	I find the game itself highly enjoyable, however, the pc version has a very tiny community.  This means the only multiplayer matches you can find the vast majority of the time are TDM and domination.
1184	-1	"The Game will Not DOWNLOAD,,, After 3 reviews,, this needs to be fixed !! I want my money reimbursed.    REVEIW #2 A DAY LATER    AFTER A LENGTHY TIME ON THE PHONE WITH AMAZON TECHINICAL SERVICE ( WHICH THEY DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND COULD NOT FIX THE DOWNLOAD ISSUE ) THEY WOULD NOT REFUND MY MONEY BACK FOR THE PURCHASE. SAYING I NEED TO GO TO THE VENDOR OF THE GAME TO GET IT \\""MAYBE\\""  RESOLVED. AFTER 16 DOWNLOADS AND HALF A DAY WASTED THIS WAS NOT AN OPTION. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AS THERE IS A DEFECT IN IT AND WHY AMAZON CONTINUES TO SELL IT ON THE VENDORS BEHALF AND NOT REPORT THE ISSUE TO KEEP GOOD THEIR GOOD CLIENT RELATIONS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. THE END RESULT WAS  I HAD TO DISPUTE THE CHARGE.    PLEASE CHECK THE OTHER REVIEWS AS YOU WILL SEE THIS GAME HAS DEFECT."
1185	1	Amazing story and a great way to end the franchise. Only complaint is lack of actual boss fights, but they're still fun.
1186	1	It is better to buy the cards online because they are fast, effective and reliable. Thank you and congratulations
1187	-1	I have just recently purchased the game so I have a limited scope on which I can review. However there are some noticeable flaws in the game that I have already noticed. I bought the PC version if you already aren't aware. I have a very strong computer (i5-2500k and a amd 6870 hd), its not top of the line, but I can near max out skyrim (heavily modded including texture packs) without dipping below 60 fps. But Deus ex has noticeable frame rate inconsistencies. I have done some research and it appears many people suffer from frame rate drops, even people with i-7's and 6970's. What makes this worse is that changing the video settings has no effect on performance, and it doesn't have impressive visuals to begin with. I would say that its no better than the half life 2 series is today. It doesn't seem like everybody has problems though.  I won't comment on the game play or story as I have only put in 2 hours so far. I will update on that later (I just wanted to warn potential buyers to do some research or to buy this on a console).
1188	0	Great graphics, too quick finish.
1189	0	I've played a lot of incarnations of Might and Magic over the years, and Heroes has always held a special place in my heart. On a whim, I downloaded this game from Amazon to see if I could re-experience some of the old magic I felt when I played the original Heroes of Might and Magic. The download over a reasonable internet connection required six hours, which ultimately failed due to frequent CRC errors during the installation. I had to download it a second time in order for it to install correctly and it takes a while to load, even after the initial confusing back story cut scenes. Not particularly taxing on system resources nor is the graphics engine that demanding of my NVidia graphics card, it's puzzling why this game takes so long to load.<br /><br />One problem is the constant DRM connection to UVERSE, which Ubisoft requires for some unknown reason. As near as I can tell, this online connection does little except sync your saved games to a cloud and occasionally offer you up some character upgrades as you progress in the game. It also tracks your game time for some reason, but like other users I find it completely unnecessary and a waste of time and system resources. It's constantly looking and downloading new versions of itself and must be stable and functional at all times, or it will just boot you out of the game.<br /><br />I'm also not thrilled with the completely confusing storyline, which is supposed to follow the path of different heroes all connected or related in some way with the central theme of an impending holy war between Angels, Demons and The Faceless. It's more convoluted and confusing than the first two seasons of the Game of Thrones, so I pretty much ignore it and forget about the plot line. I don't care who was related to whom and who'se mind was taken over and stabbed their duke father in the back and blah blah blah blah. Combined with an over-use of a made up pantheon with unfamiliar terms, Gods and abilities, i'm just wishing the storywould go away. There's far too many in-game story line pauses and it kills the game's momentum.<br /><br />What IS fun about the game is the gameplay itself. It plays pretty true to the other HOMM titles and the combat system is the same. I haven't been able to figure out a few in-game problems such as how to use the town teleporters (nothing on that in the tutorial) and there is a ridiculous amount of character customization that can be done to your player but too few ability points per level gain. Also, the amount of inventory items is nuts with at least six or seven complete suits of armor and weapons combos, all of which you will never find nor use.<br /><br />In a nutshell, i'm only continuing to play this game because of my previous experience with HOMM games. I'd have ditched it in a heartbeat for being a confusing POS if it wasn't for the HOMM game engine.
1190	0	Arma 2 is a army simulation game which takes place in Cherno. A vast city with many possibilities for action between players and possibly, Zombies. Yes zombies. The Day Z mod gives the player a whole new perspective of realistic survival case of an apocalypse on Cherno. Day Z is widely know for its originality and its realism e.g. you have a food bar, health bar, thirst bar and a thermometer icon that shows you whether your player is feeling cold.<br />Game runs great on recommended specs but try and get it running on max, to get the best out of it.<br /><br />The slight downside is that Amazon doesn't sell this game with the Steam code and some codes MAY be faulty (1/100,000 chance). I also encountered install problems and problems when inputting my codes which had to be validated (validation takes up to 2 days). It didn't run as I expected on my PC, so I have purchased another one and I hope the problem gets resolved.<br />I will update this review further after I get this game installed on my new laptop.
1191	1	The purchase was Fast and easy.
1192	1	Great character for single player!  I don't play multi-player so I was struggling with Zero and Axton.  Only thing I don't like is there are too many green outfits! ha, ha.
1193	0	Great game, just wish it didn't crash so much, and when it crashes in full screen view, the mouse can't be used for anything and I'm forced to restart computer. I don't mind playing it in window mode too much, but the crashing is still a little annoying.
1194	0	I bought this game, Bioshock 2, and GTA4 on sale for 5 dollars each. This is a very respectable deal that competes with Steam's sale prices.  However, Amazon's servers do not compete with Steam's.  Think twice before hitting the pause button on the amazon downloader.  If you pause the download it's likely you will not be able to resume it.  My downloads have restarted a couple of time when closing downloader program even though it should still be running in the background and shows it running on on the system trey.<br /><br />You should also be warned that Arma 2 takes some decent hardware to run.  My quad core i5 760 and overclocked 1GB GTX 460 have a harder time running this than Crysis, or Just Cause 2.
1195	-1	I have played and enjoyed many hours of the settlers, 4, 5, and 6.  However settlers 7 is a waste. You can't play it from more than one machine on a ISP #,  If I want to get up and go to another room in the house and play in private,YOU CAN'T.<br /><br />I won't waste $40 on this Joke.  You have to be connected to the internet, If their server goes down, or they do a maintenance on the server, or you go down, it won't play.<br /><br />When they decide to stop running the server, thats it, you can't load it and have hours of fun.  These guys and EA (stronghold series) are going to lose folks like me,(I was a stockholder, got so mad I sold it).  I won't buy a piece of crap like this at any price.<br /><br />BTW why does the game cost $5 in the UK and here it's $30 to $40.<br /><br />I joined startrek online, met a large number of ex settler players there, with the same opinion.  See you there.
1196	0	Overall, I did enjoy playing this game even with the cons I listed below.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price, on sale on Stream for $9.95<br /><br />Runs fine on older computers.<br /><br />Graphics are good.<br /><br />Does have that one more turn feeling.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Poor AI, one example is they kept on attacking my undead units even if they couldn't hurt them.  One of my ghost units was attacked by 4 units per turn without losing any health. The AI doesn't know how to counter some units.  If you create ghost units, you will pretty much win the game every time.<br /><br />No Story mode or scenarios<br /><br />Some units are overpowered, like undead units (ghost unit).<br /><br />Only 3 factions<br /><br />Magic research doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Diplomacy is useless. Computer AI will demand gold or War. No other options for you.  I had every computer controlled opponent at war with me as soon as they contact me.  The AI is poor so I could take on all 3 at once and still win.<br />The problem is the enemy mainly just resisting the player attacks and don't really threatening your cities.  I never really need to worry about guarding my cities.<br /><br />Day one DLC<br /><br />If they patch the game, adding scenarios and better AI then I would give it 4 stars.
1197	1	Worked fine, added the 2014 rosters and play it all the time.
1198	0	Best chess available for xbox 360, but thats not saying much. It's a very basic version of the classic Chessmaster game. It's called Chessmaster Live because I think it is intended to be used primarily in multiplayer mode, since this is where most of the different game modes are playable. So I gave it only 3 stars because of glaring missing features and weaknesses:   1) Not a very big online presence. If you don't mind waiting you can usually get a game though, but probably not matching your skill level.   2) The controls are clunky. In blitz type games it takes too long to move pieces.   3) The alternate game modes (dark chess, 360, etc) not available offline.   4) No tournament mode of play, but without online players this would be useless anyway.   5) There is little statistical tracking: only wins,losses,draws, and elo is all.   6) There is no game analysis.
1199	1	Best way to get a PSN card, period. As soon as the payment is confirmed you get the PSN code or if you wish, it will be sent to your e-mail. For international buyers, the only thing needed is a valid US address, it doesn't need to match the billing adress of your credit card. This way you'll save a ton against local prices.
1200	1	This game is imensely fun, when you can get it to work. The game has a tendency to not want to start up (like a lot of games from this company) but once you get it started there aren't really any bugs or other things to hinder gameplay, just make sure your computer is good enough to run it without lag. I would recommend this game if only it were at a lower price, or they fixed the startup issue then it would be good for the price it is.
1201	1	Its awesome to be able to play with friends and cousins who are 2 or even 1000s of miles away.
1202	1	Great graphics!!! Plays like the PS3 versions of Killzone, from the control to the presentation. Hopefully they can use the game engine for other titles.
1203	1	the game is great just don't buy it from amazon. i preordered it from them and then i did not get my preorder stuff i only preordered from them to get civ 5 and such but they did not help me i sent a help email and got no reply.
1204	0	Too damn easy! It was worth the bargain I got but it was such a simple game that I was quickly bored.
1205	1	X-Com: EU is (as you know by now) an outstanding game. The Bureau has its ups and downs but is definitely worth playing. A bit incoherent at times, but with twists that are a ton of fun, plus an amazing 60's vibe. I say it is worth a run through despite what metacritic might tell you.
1206	-1	:(
1207	-1	I would love to review this game, But Steam decided I had better things to do with my time, rather than play it. I would advise avoiding any game that requires you to use Steam
1208	0	This game is ok if you don't have too high expecations. It's nice a a Little just for fun game.
1209	-1	Wow, the other people who reviewed it must own stock. This is such a letdown after Broderlands 2. In the Pre-Sequel there is very little variety from location to location. In Borderlands 2 the sets are beautiful.<br />I played the Pre-Sequel for quite a while and it just seemed to be the same old same old. It really was not fun.<br />Went back to playing Borderlands 2.
1210	-1	This did not work at all and I paid 30 - 40 dollars for NOTHING EXEPT A VIRUS ON MY COMPUTER
1211	1	TOTALLY LOVE...I Love this game completely...once you start you can't stop.....I have to force myself to stop to take a break...it is such a fun game.
1212	1	Purchased as a gift. It worked out great.
1213	1	Did not met my expectation.
1214	-1	I love this game for Xbox, so I assumed it would be even better on my Gaming PC with 1440p monitor.  Nope.  Hackers abound, games are very hard to find, and I have yet to get to level 30 without being boosted to level 70 without my consent (honestly, unlocking weapons is my favorite part).  Avoid this for PC.  Much better on Xbox.
1215	-1	The ONLY reason this gets 2 stars is because this is by far the best Splinter Cell yet! When it works . . . .<br /><br />I bought the PC Download version and while every other game I've downloaded through Amazon has been played through Steam, this one is played through UPlay. It worked great at first and I was absolutely loving it. Then it asked me to update and patch and that's when the problems started . . .<br /><br />I'm not going to sit here and type out half a novel of all the things I've been through but I will sum it up for you:<br />1. Update and patch = game now crashes on start up (every time)<br />2. Tried ALL the fixes Ubisoft support emailed me with and that the phone techs suggested on the phone = game still crashes on start up<br />3. I have uninstalled and re-installed EIGHT times to the tune of 4-5 hours of download time each = game works until updates and patches go through then it's back to #1.<br />4. Neither Ubisoft or Amazon will refund my $70<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PC DOWNLOAD HERE!!! Buy it directly from Steam and save yourself the time and money.
1216	0	The Good: Great atmosphere, clever enemy design, looks amazing<br /><br />The Bad: Super slow pacing throughout, lots of glitches, requires monster rig to run, needs better shooting mechanics, can be really hard at times, story is hard to follow<br /><br />I love first person shooters with great atmosphere and Cryostasis pulls this off well. While the story is pretty confusing and never really makes any sense at all (even at the end) you at least know why you're here. You are moving through a Russian nuclear ice breaker that was destroyed after hitting an iceberg (sound familiar). You walk around finding dead bodies and upon touching them you can relive the moments leading to their death and try and prevent it so you can continue getting through the area that is blocked. This also provides more back story on how the ship actually did hit the iceberg and why.<br /><br />The game is a first person shooter so you get some guns, but the game is slow paced and not a high octane shooter like most people like. You move very slowly and you have to take your time aiming since these guns don't exactly fire at a high rate. You get several different types such as bolt action rifles, a tommy gun, a water cannon (that uses icicles!), and even a flare gun. The aiming is slow like I mentioned and you just feel like your shooting in slow motion. This isn't entirely bad since you can take your time and aim because ammo is a tad scarce. You do, however, never feel like your guns are very powerful even on the weaker enemies. But you don't get guns right away since for a good 25% through the game you get to use melee weapons.<br /><br />The enemies in the game are pretty unique and not just average cannon fodder. These enemies are pretty creepy and look great and behave decently towards your actions. Some swing axes and some shoot back, but they are all pretty hard to take down especially the bigger guys later on.<br /><br />The game doesn't really consist of puzzles but the game is a linear maze some times. You do flip switches an activate heat sources (more on that later), but there's no actual puzzles in the game. This game makes things a bit dull and feel monotonous since the tone of the game never really changes and even the atmosphere wears thin before the end. You're opening a lot of doors, flipping a lot of switches, and shooting some bad guys and that's about it. This game is really only for people who are into atmosphere and story.<br /><br />You can use any heat source such as lamps, lights, heaters, fires, you name it to recharge your health. There are two meters and the outer one shows how warm the room is or the heat source. You can only heal up to where that meter stops, and then you have your endurance gauge for sprinting.<br /><br />The game looks pretty good and you need a monster rig to run this with DirectX10 and get the best looking settings. The textures are highly detailed, and you can even watch the ice melt and watch the water run down walls in real time. Of course this was one of the very first DX10 games so there are plenty of glitches. The PS4.0 has a problem making animations jerky so you have to fiddle around with minimizing to the desktop and changing it from 3 to 4 to get it to stop. The game will crash at random some times, and there is some weird out of no where glitches throughout. This makes the game very frustrating to play even if you have a hefty rig.<br /><br />The game can feel like a chore towards the end because the pace never changes and is just deliberately slow and the story just never makes sense. However, it has something about it that makes you keep playing regardless of all this, but people who like fast action should stay away. Cryostasis could have been a lot better with a more stable engine, better shooting, and a more steady pace instead of just slow throughout. If you have the rig to the run this game and the patience then Cryostasis is your thing.inear maze some times.

1217	0	Darksiders 2 has, in my opinion, big shoes to fill considering how fun the original game was. The games is still very much a mature Zelda-like clone, but the environments aren't as interesting as the apocalypse setting on 1. Worth a rental or purchase if cheap enough.
1218	-1	I'm another old school SimCity fan, and I'm another pissed off and let down 'end user'. I can't add anything that hasn't been said by the legions of disappointed reviewers, except that I should have listened to the rest of them. Shame on you EA. I'm ashamed to have waited so patiently for this game that's barely worth the money I paid for it and that I've only been able to play once. Besides, you 'lost' my city anyway. I've never asked for a refund on a game. This is a worthy first time.
1219	1	I need my game to come that I paid for...
1220	-1	This game is not nearly as interesting as some I have played online.  I thought it was going to be fun, it is not.
1221	1	Quick and easy!
1222	1	After going through the 2000's buying each new release of NCAA Football I've switched to every other year for the past 6 years, and naturally had to purchase this as it is the last one to be made.  What was an impulse purchase has led to many, many hours of fun already.  I've still run into some glitches and play balance issues like you would in the past, but this has felt like one of the most complete versions of the game in a long time.<br /><br />If you enjoy the NCAA series I highly recommend it.  :)
1223	0	This game has so many bugs and glitches.  Warner Montreal should be embarrassed.  It's not awful, but it's not as fun as the other &#34;Arkham&#34; games.
1224	0	NOT WORTH ENOUNGH FOR ME BECAUSE THE CARS IT HAS ARE NOT INTERESTING. I'D HAVE RATHER PREFER THE ULTIMATE SPEED PACK WHICH HAS BETTER CARS. THIS DLC HAS OLD CARS.
1225	1	It's a great game, downloaded and installed with out a problem, took me about 1.5 hrs to download and another 30 mins to install.
1226	-1	Not much I can really add, other than that the folks at EA should be absolutely ashamed. They've made their bed.
1227	0	"This game is really fun and pretty addicting, but it is pretty short.  My biggest pet peeve with this game is that when you're doing a puzzle and you as the fairy for a hint all she does is repeat whatever it is she said at the beginning of the puzzle (i.e., \\""it looks like something's hidden in there!\\"").  I mean, what help is that at all?  It got really annoying.  Also, the game seemed to get lazier as it progressed.  In the first few areas you have to do these fun and interesting puzzles to clear the rooms of evil.  In the later puzzles it's like all you have to do is look at something and touch one thing and BAM!, it's done.  Lastly, and this is something that bothers me about a lot of these seek and find games, is the rather stunning amount of grammatical errors.  There's a puzzle where you have to read a page out of a book and it was like reading something written by a 5 year old.  Example: \\""He built castle for he and his dogs, for he love them.\\""  Really?  Are these games not beta tested or edited at all?<br /><br />All in all a fun game, but not worth paying for since it's over so quick and there's no replay value as NOTHING CHANGES.  The placement of all the objects in the \\""hidden object\\"" portion of the game remains the same EVERY SINGLE TIME."
1228	1	cause it is all i need for my game of castlevania lords of shadow 2 so i can have fun
1229	1	Steam download, this was awesome! All the game here are a lot of fun and I highly recommend this pack!
1230	1	I wish it had more cars and more racing venues. That said the POV inside the cabin, the blur and shake when you have a collision or run off the road are great fun. You can really tell whether your car is front- or rear-heavy, whether it is Front- Rear- or All Wheel-Drive..
1231	1	Great. No issues.
1232	0	First off, the game is incredibly beautiful.  Even without the gameplay, I just want to wander around the streets of Renaissance Italy and bask in the warm glow of the late afternoon Tuscan sunshine.  The storyline is entertaining, with inclusions of real people like Cesare Borgia to enhance the connection with history.  Adding to the visual opulence of the game is the amazing diversity of actions that the character can perform, including climbing, leaping, acrobatics, horseback riding, and complex combat maneuvers.  The variety of executable movements, however, makes for a daunting number of keystroke combinations required to perform all of these actions.  Basic movements are straightforward enough and are adequately explained in the manual and tutorials, but more complex moves require that multiple keys be pressed, sometimes tapped, sometimes held, sometimes in specific order, and all varying depending upon the type of weapon you have, the environment in which you're operating, the kind of motion in which you are engaged, whether NPCs are interacting with you at the moment, etc.  Just imagine for a minute the number of keystroke combinations possible - it's staggering.  Unfortunately, the player's manual only provides fairly minimal guidance, leaving you frequently frustrated trying to figure out how to perform a particular action.  For example, one mission tasks the player with recovering a stolen purse from a fleeing thief, whom you are supposed to tackle - not kill, if you kill the thief, the mission aborts and restarts.  Okay, fine, the only trouble is, no one tells you how to perform a tackle.  I've ended up spending a fair amount of time searching online chat groups (which are filled with queries from other, similarly frustrated players), trying to learn which keystrokes you have to make in order to accomplish this and other maneuvers required to proceed through the game.  A certain amount of this is unavoidable: with so many different possible movements, there are going to have to be a lot of different keystroke sequences to initiate them.  But the manual's lack of helpfulness is disconcerting, and even finding answers on the web is complicated by the fact that different players provide different responses specific to their platform, so you may find someone who knows how to perform the movement, but it still doesn't help you because they only know how to perform it on xbox and you're playing on a mac.  With enough patient trial and error, you can eventually figure all of this stuff out and you may personally find that either a stimulating challenge or an irritating frustration; either way, the end results will be spectacular.  Just be ready for a lot of effort trying to figure out the gameplay mechanics.  One near deal breaker for me is that the game does not offer a way to quickly save and reload.  Missions are protracted, time consuming affairs and, if you make one mistake at any point in the mission, you have to start all the way back at the beginning again.  Especially given how complicated the gameplay is, and how easy it is to encounter a situation requiring some combination of moves or tactics that you will have to go research before you can continue, the inability to save at a specific point and come back to that point is really aggravating.  In sum, a lovely game with a good story and great action that could have been a lot better with a few basic inclusions.
1233	1	Wonderful<br />I liked very much<br />Very convenient
1234	-1	Spent over $100 of my time in trying to get this game to work. I am so disappointed in Rockstar!<br /><br />I have repaired computers for the past 8 years and never seen something so messed up as this game.<br /><br />I could get it to work with more elbow grease but it all comes down to my time. I will just go down and buy a PS3 and the game.
1235	0	Thoroughly enjoyable until I hit a glitch in the cabaret. The hint showed that I should cut the chain to obtain the vial.The hint verified that  I had the correct implement. No matter what I did it wouldn't allow me to sever the chain. I am stuck. I cannot go anywhere else. I can do nothing more. I deleted everything and downloaded again. Same results.
1236	0	This is a wonderful game with great graphics and music...BUT once you get through the first completion and go into the difficult level, the game only progresses so far and then somehow erases all your progress so that when you come back in, you are starting at the beginning.  I tried this twice, with the same results twice.    Also, it bogged down my laptop while playing.  I bought the disc version and played from that installation.
1237	-1	save your 3 bucks! It is horrible.  Minus 5 stars is better rating.
1238	0	I had all intention of purchasing this game. I don't keep up on most of the news on gaming I just remember playing this game as a kid and loving it! Anyway, thank you for all of the discussions I read alot of them and laughed at alot of them too. ;) also thank you amazon for providing me with a quality site that I can go to to purchase my wants. If it weren't for amazon and the people who spoke out about the quality of Simcity. I would have bought this game and been another unsatisfied costumer. You guys saved me 60 bucks.
1239	0	Downloaded Sim City 4 to make the time go by until the new Sim City comes out this February. This game is pretty buggy and doesn't really run all that well on Windows 7. For $10 - well it's okay. Nothing to brag about and not as good as I remember.
1240	-1	If enjoy playing a game with great gameplay and great graphics for five minute segments at a time.....then this is the game for you! Basically the online service crashes frequently. Origin support is like Best Buy's geek squad for customer support in complex issues. Worthless. The company basically makes you modify your router to even attempt to get the game to work and it still won't work. I bought this about a month ago and donated probably ten hours to fix it. Therefore, I would not recommend buying this game unless you're a full blown software engineer/computer enthusiast or if you like paying money for a game that is frequently down online with poor customer support. I would rate this five stars if I could simply play the game without it crashing because of server errors that have not been resolved for 1.5 years. I will asking for a refund through Origin for this.
1241	-1	Dont get me wrong...it was a great game, kept me entertain but now its saying to be continued..where is the rest of the game?! just when i was getting into it the game is finish ...what the hell!!! i paid $7 for this!? someone need to give me my money back

1243	0	I bought it for the PS4. But honestly the free games they have out for the PS4 are not that great. Hopefully it will get better. If you still want to use it for your PS3 however, chances you will be getting some good games. So keep that in mind when purchasing.
1244	0	The idea for this game is great, but the execution of it seems (For me) to be lacking. After creating my character- which took me quite a while, I was already beginning to experience fatigue from the game. And sure enough I quickly found myself becoming bored, and feeling very little excitement throughout the game, and the keyboard controls (As i don't have a game controller) were simply too difficult at times for me to cope...
1245	-1	I can't get it to download. I am not able to play the game as I did on my old computer.
1246	-1	I bought this code and I got it and tried t enter and it and it did not work! Do Not Buy! waste of 20 dollars
1247	1	The graphics don't hold this game back it is highly enjoyable. Only compaint is that you need to play a warrior. Other than that the game is very injoyable with alot of fun trials for 100%ers
1248	-1	This game starts out fun, but as you progress, it is evident of how broken this game is.  I find myself just starting over in order to enjoy it again.
1249	-1	"When I try to redeem the code an error appears that shows \\""The prepaid card code you entered is incorrect or is no longer valid\\"". What's happening?!    And I already contacted Sony, and they told me to contact Amazon because I purchased the code there, and that you need to provide me the solution, they told me that the code maybe is unactive.    Edit 01/06/14 8pm PT.  I just purchased another code and same error, 2 different codes that doesn't work. What's the meaning of that? Are you sure that all the codes are working? Because I don't think that they are. My god, I don't know what to think about this. I need a solution for this ASAP!  Come on Amazon, you can't be doing this to your customers. Help me please."
1250	0	Ok, the game is great, but the problem is that since it's running via Origin,I think, the game kept crashing. That's is a fact.
1251	1	I bought this game to play with my kids as a game to play after Harsbro's Family Game Night 3.  This game is perfect, and has great questions that are educational in addition to the pop culture ones.  Fun and clean - Recommended for families
1252	0	You need ps+ to be online with a ps4. Games are a bonus. Just keep your subscription active. Otherwise they will be locked and unplayable.
1253	0	There's such much to this game, it will take some getting used to. It's fun to learn about the different civilizations and it gives you so many to choose from; some that I didn't even know existed! I personally find it a bit boring and can't stay on it for too long, however when you're playing with your friends? It's actually pretty fun. I recommend it anyone who enjoys strategy games with looong matches, and tons of different options to choose from as far as building your civilization. Hope this review helped.
1254	-1	I am sure this is a good product, but I keep getting error messages when I try to launch the program, so I have not been able to review or utilize the program.<br /><br />Very disappointing.
1255	1	it is  fast pace, and challenging to keep all the planes going, I got the iPhone one as well, and it has bin a fun busying thing to do wen I have just a few minutes to kill, each level is incrementally more challenging, and is relatively short, so you can play it, and not commit to a long time consuming game, less you just wont to go on to the next step in the game! ( I set my goals hi enough so I don't move on to the next level till I have no missed planes, and at least 2 stars, so the game does not go by to fast )
1256	-1	cant even play I try downloading it and it just send me in a loop
1257	-1	One of the worse games I've had the displeasure of playing. Difficult game play. Navigating through the game extremely difficult.
1258	-1	I bought it and put the 12 digit code nothing happen it wrote its a wrong code or its not valid anymore does someone know something about that?
1259	1	Very enjoyable game, much fuller than the standard xcom. New gameplay features make the game significantly more interesting. My only qualm is that it should have been part of the original game but hey, this is the world we live in (until aliens invade, that is)
1260	-1	It never downloaded to my computer than I bought a copy and it would not down load to the computer from the  disk<br /><br />am McDannel
1261	1	If you enjoy the save the world SciFi genre with cause/effect (like Mass Effect), the turn based VATS style combat from Fallout mixed with squad combat elements from Company of Heroes then you'll love XCOM.<br /><br />The learning curve is initially steep since the combination of so many different combat types, and the implementation of a few of their own options, can be a lot to handle; but once you get a handle on the mechanics, they work together seamlessly.<br /><br />The story line is a little arbitrary, and the psionic powers occur so late in the game that they're mediocre. Additionally, while the Multiplayer is an enjoyable (if very competitive) experience, there don't appear to be many people utilizing the matchmaker service, so finding a game can be rather cumbersome.<br /><br />All-in-All it's one of my favorite titles of the season and after over ten hours of gameplay I was still sad to see it end. Here's hoping that there's a sequel to keep the magic going!
1262	0	I was hoping to have a little nostalgia with this product. Unfortunately it was not as good as the original I remember playing as a kid. However I really liked how the walk-throughs gave you fatalities, and ways to play the game, took some of the frustration out of trying to figure them out on your own, but then again that was part of the fun.
1263	-1	Installing the downloaded version of the game NBA 2K14, with Steam, from Amazon was a nightmare!<br /><br />I can't even comment on the game play because I can't even get into the game! It just keeps going around in circles. I purchased X Box 360 for the PC controllers for 2K games (because my Logitech Game pad controllers never worked with previous 2K games).<br /><br />Once after fiddling endlessly with non responsive controls and keyboard presses, I actually got a game to start!<br />Of course then I couldn't control the players! I had gone to the controller setup and wrote down the game pad controls but controlling anything was just an ordeal and I just gave up in frustration!<br /><br />I played all the NBA Live versions from 95 - 2008 with no install or controller problems (but EA Sports betrayed PC users and ended the series on the PC).  If I want to play basketball or baseball I have to play the last EA Sports versions for the PC.  The 2K versions (this is my third) just do not work even after buying the X Box controllers.<br /><br />All I want to do is play a game against a present human (not online) or against the CPU, but these 2K Games, refuse to work on my PC ( A very expensive Dell 8300 purchased last year running Windows 7 Ultimate  64Bit ).<br /><br />I have been using computers for over thirty years and I have rarely if ever, had so many problems, with any PC software (including games) as I have had with 2K Sports games!<br /><br />Steam is a real pain in the neck! It's always updating when I turn on the computer or when I am shutting down! I feel as if I am renting this game instead of owning it .  Why so many endless steps to even install the game? This is the most convoluted game setup I have ever seen in all my years.<br /><br />Does anyone else have all these controller issues with 2K Sports PC games? I have totally given up on 2K Sports games!<br /><br />  Happy Holidays<br />  M Calcagno
1264	-1	"EDIT: It's been a month since its release and after several patches and updates, I need to update my own review. Although there has been improvement in the game (sound loop bug fixed, missing graphics bug fixed), many problems still persist including (but not limited to): instant death kills; random lobby crashes; and \\""Game Disconnected: something went wrong\\""--this message appears so often that I've started to think of it as \\""I can't believe you're still playing this game..hahaha\\"". The real problem, and I think it's a serious problem for any company that wants to retain customers, is that the feeling that the BF 4 PC community has is \\""what now?\\"" What will go wrong now (or next)?. That is detrimental to any efforts for game shelf-life.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this game, but after two days of playing it, the only good thing I can say about it is the graphics are amazing. I have all of the glitches and all of the random spawn points. I don't like the fact that unless you play with a squad, you're a lone wolf and you just get rolled over. There definitely needs to be a place or options for people who just want to play a casual game without having to call up every friend they have just to form a squad. I shouldn't have to work to enjoy a game. It's pleasure should be easily and readily presentable. Instead, I find myself feeling completely frustrated playing in lobbies with guys who are obviously a gigantic squad or several squads working together. They make the game very very not fun.<br /><br />Also, being kicked out of lobbies for no reason, having the game freeze up for no reason, and the lag are all contributing factors for why I do NOT recommend this game. I'm very disappointed. I have a brand new computer with a Nvidia 660 Ti video card. I shouldn't be having problems with weird glitches and or very weird (and random) missing parts of the graphics during a gameplay. However, the lag is ridiculous (and very laughable...it sort of looks like we're all dubstepping), and THAT is the biggest disappointment.<br /><br />Battlefield 4 fails to deliver."
1265	1	The quad pack was a savings over the individual packs alone, which was the whole point. And then of course Helm's Deep came out, haha. And then the sale.  Sigh.  It was actually a gift so I can't complain about the price.  For what it's worth there's a good deal of content and I'm pretty happy with it so far.
1266	-1	"Galaxy on Fire 2 is a PC port of a legendary iOS starfigher game.  It includes customization ships, a vast universe of different races and planets, along with excellent replayablility and graphics.  You take the role of Keith T. Maxwell, a displaced starfigher pilot whisked into a future of civil war and galactic threat.  Much of the game centers on dogfighting combat and ship upgrades.<br /><br />I'll be honest--I've been hooked on the mobile version of GoF2 for some time now.  It was simple to pick up, easy to play for hours on end, and the controls made sense given what they had to work with on the iOS platform.  Menus were easy to navigate and the ships were cunningly designed and beautiful to handle and admire.  So when I found out that there was a higher resolution PC version, I immediately jumped on it at the first sign of a sale.<br /><br />And thank god it was on sale, otherwise I'd think I wasted $20.<br /><br />The iOS version, as mentioned, was simple to operate and fun as heck.  The PC port has been disappointing to say the least.<br /><br />--The Controls:  Handling a single-man ship hurling at hundreds of kilometers a second, skillfully navigating asteroid belts and enemy fighters is the kind of fun one expects to have in a spaceflight simulator.  Handling a disoriented pig that can't turn to save its own lard is not.  Unfortunately, this version leans towards pig-based starship handling.  When I picked up my mouse and keyboard to try this out, I noticed two things:  One, 1900 DPI is far too high to be playing this game and turn properly.  400, near the limit of my mouse's capability, is much more appropriate.  Second, adding to the mouse turn issue, turning speed cannot be modified in any way through the game, a feature that apparently was lost in translation from iOS.  Fortunately, I had a backup xBox 360 controller that was supposed to be compatible with the game.  But lo and behold, it had issues too!<br /><br />Turning speed is far too fast to warrant using the controller--as you still have to aim your porcine starfighter's cannons, turning too fast causes you to overadjust, and in that time your enemy has circled around you and torn you a new airlock.  And I'll give you a solid bet that Fishlabs does not understand that triggers are designed for todays market to be USED for gun-like applications.  There is a REASON why they resemble actual triggers.  Instead, the game uses the A and B buttons to fire the main and secondary weapons, making the average person stumble around the controls with the same accuracy and handling of their lardfighter.  And if you don't like these controls, well lemme pass on a big solid middle finger from the game designers, because they cannot be adjusted at all.  Period.  Adjustments are for the keyboard only.  I've thought about getting an actual joystick just to make the game playable...  But that's spending another $25 to play a $6 game.<br /><br />--The Story:  Average at best, but it kinda has the cheesy endearing quality of old sci-fi films.  \\""Oh no, we're about be destroyed by this race of big beetles, let's send this disoriented and strapping young hot-shot and his hot scientist assistant to stop them!\\""  Or that's what it's supposed to be.  I dunno, I let story take second in the iOS version because I played more for gameplay. I do recommend keeping the sound off for any story sequences though, or the voice acting is likely to make you side with the bugger aliens.  I'll give it a three-outta-five just for guiding you somewhere and giving half a laugh along the way, even if it's a pity laugh at the attempts at humor.  Or the bra floating in space at the ending.<br /><br />--The Gameplay:  The original iOS version had perfected gameplay--snappy controls, an intuitive menu system, and kick-ass graphics in both the HD and standard definition versions.  The port basically said \\""Screw it, I don't care\\"" and went off to the pub to join Fallout: New Vegas and talk about their own convoluted menu systems.  Seriously!  How hard is it to make sure you can read the text on the next ship you're going to buy!  And the menu refuses to interact with the controller at all--have to go back to mouse and keyboard there, buddy.  Along with the hideous controls, this threw the game out for me.  I can only praise the graphics--they're indie-looking and highly colorized, and make your eyes shoot out rainbow lasers the first time you fly out into an asteroid belt.  The graphics team gets my seal of approval, whatever that's worth.<br /><br />--Price:  $20 is too much for this port.  Sorry.  Wait for Steam sales, or just get it free for a mobile platform.  It'll be better for your health and sanity anyways.<br /><br />--Final Verdict:  If you own an actual flight joystick, then go ahead.  This game might agree with whatever you try to pump into it with a different control module.  If you think you can handle the mouse and keyboard on here, good effing luck!  I'll see you in the psych ward!  Piggish handling and failed menus dictate an incredibly rude message to the consumer, something along the lines of a half-finished animated single-finger salute, and the code junkies didn't even respect you enough to fill the rest of the damn thing in.  Graphics and corny qualities bring this experiment up a star in my mind, but that still leaves it at a flat one.<br /><br />Fishlabs, you're not a bad company in yourselves.  But you've just wrecked a fan with this half-baked product.  If you release an update addressing the lack of modifiable controls and derp-based menus, then I'll come back and sing your name with joy.  Or better yet, let the modding community at it.  That'll do your job for you.  But until then, don't expect many more satisfied customers.  How are we supposed to enjoy a game if we cannot figure out how to use it?<br /><br />-The Judge"
1267	1	A must for parents of xbox kids.. the code displayed instantly and was activated immediately.. We even received a email with code as reminder.
1268	1	I have only played it for near 20 hours so far, but I can barely put it down once I start. I enjoyed the first one on the PS3 immensely, but playing the sequel on the Mac has blown me away. I am amazed at how beautiful and smooth this game runs on an Intel Iris Pro iMac. I have setting turned up nearly all the way at 900p resolution, and there is no lag what-so-ever. I was hesitant to purchase it at the beginning because of the horror stories you hear in regards to gaming on the Mac. For anyone on the fence, I highly recommend this game. On a side note, I don't see all the fuss over having to use Steam to play this game. To me it makes the experience more fun if you have friends on it and/or utilize the features that it offers.
1269	-1	no it did not meet my expectations, the game did not work and I'm still not able to play it till this day. the game will not install. I won't be buying another online game from Amazon
1270	1	If you live outside US and want to purchase in the US Store, you can purchase a PS Gift Card and redeem the code to get the credit in your wallet.
1271	0	Great interface and a fun turn based game.<br /><br />The downside is that you are stuck playing within the bounds of history.  I can appreciate working within those bounds for part of the game, but I'd like to have the option of starting at the beginning and trying to do what wasn't done in history.  Whether that is the Russians or the Germans.  For the price I'd look elsewhere.
1272	-1	TERRIBLE! Never experienced something quite like this. Bought the game days ago. First off, game was half-way decent at best. It sounded like the game was open twice because the music overlapped itself. Had to mute it.<br />They‚Äôre making you start from scratch with items meaning, there‚Äôs no dishwasher, can‚Äôt own cars, no hot tubs.. So they‚Äôre going to sell you expansion packs for $40 later, selling you the same stuff that you already had in the Sims 3.<br />Then there was a patch update (after like the 1st day!) that stopped the game from being able to upload. We literally played the game less than 10 hours total and updated it for it not to load again!<br />We uninstalled, re-installed and did everything they suggested (EXCEPT TURN OFF THE FIRE-WALLS, DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR FIRE-WALLS!) and the whole process took hours, which turned into days. After 2 days and 2 customer reps we asked for a full re-fund. Be forewarned‚Ä¶ If you have the game for 24 hours they will not give you your money back. We argued that although we had the game for three days, we‚Äôve only been able to play for 10 hours! Because we called the night before and had records of trying everything under the sun to get this game to load, and after asking to speak to a supervisor, they refunded our money but it‚Äôll still take 3 business days before we see it.<br />As far as the fire-walls.. a few people that took them down as they were requested to do, noticed that they got hacked very soon after.<br />Get your money back ASAP and if you want to give them another chance, wait at least 6 months before you buy again and only after keeping up with the games progress and reviews
1273	0	this game was not what I was expecting. It is a little boring wish there was a little more action.
1274	-1	This one will not work with my windows 8.1 machine although Ricochet Infinity does even though it is older!  Weird.
1275	1	Easy to use controls and an enjoyable story line and plot.... Great game for fans of hack and slash with some puzzles and magic thrown in.
1276	-1	Game is unplayable!! Beware! do not purchase! Scam! Worst launch of a game ever!!<br /><br />Why buy a game you can't play?
1277	1	Everything was great. It downloaded fine and very well worth the money. I do wish there was some instructions to get started.
1278	0	Download time was 7 days...a negative. Some of the games are corrupted. The C&C (early) Red Alert game was thoroughly corrupted...so I erased the complete software...I was very disappointed. Most of the games allows you to complete only a couple of &#34;battles or campaigns,&#34; and then it &#34;locks&#34; and will not allow you to go forward onto further battles or campaigns...this made me very disgusted and angry. As the saying goes: &#34;you get what you pay for!&#34; The cheap price results in getting a poorly product. I would say that this is a poorly designed game!
1279	1	Thanks so much
1280	0	Before I get into the review I'd like to point out I play destiny on a daily basis. I play an average of 3 hours a day. Here are my pros and cons for the House of wolves expansion:  Pros: - Playing PVP(Player vs Player modes) gets you better rewards than it used to. - Exotic gear ascending is much better(you do not lose previous progress) - Old legendary gear may be upgraded to the new Damage Cap of 365(With Etheric Light) - The speaker now exchanges several materials making them useful once again  Cons: - The expansion did not include the advertised Raid. - Grinding for keys to the queens chest every week is too time consuming. - The rewards from the queens barrows chest are mediocre. - Prison of Elders rewards are stingy. This makes re-playability less appealing. - Prison of elders level 35 rewards are not dropping for 2dn and 3rd characters. - Leveling up your faction can still give you blue engrams and miscellaneous materials. - The drop rate for faction ships and shaders is still very low. - The new arena modes need checkpoints(at least level 35) - The Vault space is too small  I'll start by getting into what I like from the expansion. The upgrade paths for weapons and armor have been updated and the update is very welcomed. You can now upgrade your old exotic gear without the help of Xur and without losing your previous progress. You just need an exotic shard, weapon parts and glimmer. Old legendary weapons can now be upgraded to the current damage cap with just etheric light. Much appreciated as well. Old shards and energy can now be converted to Motes of light by the speaker. They can now be turned into useful currency.  Now for the bad. I'll start off with the worst part of the expansion. The treasure keys. You need them to open a chest below the prison of elders once you have cleared it. These keys can be obtained(farmed) from events that appear on certain areas on the Earth/Moon/Venus. There are several event spots on each planet and these events appear about five times an hour on average at each location. After you clear all the enemies from the event you have one and a half minutes to find a chest that spawns in the area. This chest may contain Engrams/ascending materials /ammo synthesis/treasure keys. Here lies the problem. The drop rate for these keys is absurdly low. I farmed for 10 hours straight last weekend and got 4 keys for my efforts. Couple that with the fact that you get a lot of special ammo synthesis which you cannot delete and is rarely useful. Here's the sad part of this whole ordeal. After all those hours spent due to the low drop rate, I clear the Prison of elders on all 4 difficulties with my main character and all I get from the queens barrow chest is junk, that's right junk. No exotics, just strange coins, motes of light and queens weapons. The queens weapon set is horrible. To summarize this whole thing for everyone. You'll grind 2 hours on average for a key. It'll take you 3-4 hours to clear prison of elders on all four levels and then you'll receive nothing good for your trouble(you get the armor cores, weapon cores and etheric light without opening the big chest).  The prison of elders itself has a several problems. You're supposed to get a ship, an emblem and a shader for clearing level 35 the first time you do so with each of your characters. It works for the first character, but it does not for your 2nd and 3rd characters. It still did not work after the first weekly reset.  I'd also like to point out that this expansion was supposed to have a raid. It was advertised as so when I paid for it. The raid was replaced by prison of elders which is an arena activity and does not measure up to a raid in my opinion.  I'm very dissapointed in the new pve weapon sets(Fallen and Queen). No elemental burn for primaries. The fallen set has the worst idea in fallen specific burns. A rocket with no tracking? Vandal Burn? Dreg Burn? Shank burn? What a waste of a perk.  I would also like to point out that the attempt at enlarging vault space with a recent update was not enough. We need more vault space. I've had to delete several pieces of gear I worked hard to attain. I cannot fit all my gear in such a small space. I do not know what's keeping Bungie from providing the adequate space, but this need to be fixed by yesterday.  Update 8-3-2015 Several things have changed since the initial release of HOW. More notably, Skolas(Level 35 Prison of Elders) no longer has Elemental Burns. The Queens Ship is dropping every single time you clear level 35, but you only get one shader and one emblem for your primary character, that's no good. My 3 star rating still stands.
1281	0	I've been playing this for about a week now (4 or 5 games) and so far I miss last years game. The gameplay is lacking and is pretty different from last years near flawless product. Presentation is an upgrade in-game over last years but that's about it thus far. If you're knee-deep in 2k13, I would just stay put if I were u guys.
1282	0	This game is obviously designed for a child, and looked at that way it is just fine: easy, clear to see, whiles away some time.
1283	1	great bundle i got for a great price all the game are worth their asking price this bundle give them all for fraction that cost if you can get this bundle it worth it
1284	1	So, I live outside of the US. This makes it impossible for me to use my credit card to buy PSN content. Thus the PSN cards were the only other option opened to me. In the 3 years I have owned my PS3 I have not utilized this option for 2 reasons. Firstly, the expense. Unless I was buying the cards in the US, I would end up paying up to 30% more than the value of the credit for a card. That was unacceptable. The other matter was one of convenience. I am a big online shopper and as such find it hard to go out of my way to find a store that sells them locally. Amazon has again come to my rescue. This service is absolutely instantaneous, foolproof and incredibly convenient. The fact that you save a cent and help save a tree in this paperless transaction is just an added bonus.
1285	-1	Code never worked and I had to use steamed website and code was not compatible with their website. Frustrated with the whole process. I should not have to use another website after purchasing the game on your website. Your instructions on using the code is vague at best!
1286	0	Plus:<br /><br />It's not really long but long enough.<br />There is a sufficient variety of scenes.<br />HO scenes are 'find silhouette items' but okay.<br />Violence is implied and not really that serious.<br />Hints work well for 'where to go next'.<br />Puzzles, sometimes easy and sometimes inexplicable, have Skip.<br />The Journal is actually helpful.<br /><br />Minus:<br /><br />The Menu button covers part of the remarks necessary to the game; you can guess the missing words but it's a serious flaw.<br />As usual, found papers are not of interest (to me or the game's progress and solution) but stay highlighted as if they mattered.<br />The filesize is a bit large for the content.<br /><br />The game is not as complex and well-constructed as the better games, but it's certainly (re)playable and worth buying when on sale.
1287	-1	Norton Security elerted me (when I was installing it) that the file had hazards so I stopped the install. Very diappointing.
1288	0	3 start
1289	1	it does almost everything I want, good  easy to operate.  love watching the games my grand kids played in. give me memories I can enjoy any time.
1290	0	"This game is a 4.5; the game's support is a 2. Honestly, if I averaged all my assessments, it would be a 3.80, but Amazon, unfortunately, doesn't have that capability. Here are the details:<br /><br />Guild Wars 2 is a beautiful game, well-rendered and thoughtfully designed. It plays through quite well and leveling is not the chore it usually is in standard MMO's. The combat mechanics are centered around a set of 5 skills that are unalterable; they can be changed by switching to a different weapon which then brings up a different set of skills. Good things about combat = basic damage skill (skill #1) is also your auto fire, so you don't have to worry about constantly re-firing it and activating other skills does not turn that off unless you want to cancel it by de-targeting. Bad things about combat = inflexible system with little option for skill customization. (4.5 stars)<br /><br />Dynamic events take the place of local quests. These events occur as tasks to help local NPCs in difficulty; your level is adjusted to match the level of the area; the rewards scale to match your true level. Results: you can go back to farm items when you are high level, but you'll be at the event level, so you will have to work for the drops, but you can always get a lot - no diminishing rewards for level discrepancy. It makes a great  deal of sense. (5 stars)<br /><br />Crafting and exploring are a large part of leveling up in the game, and the landscape (including the major cities) is peppered with vistas that you must jump and climb to gain experience from for claiming them. Leveling through questing comes in the form of your \\""personal story\\"". These are quest adventures that develop based on choices you made when you created your character and continue to make as the story unfolds. (4.5 stars)<br /><br />The gameplay (with the exception of lackluster dungeons that offer only boss mobs that have incredibly too large hit point pools and not much else to recommend them) is outstandingand quite honestly a lot of fun (3 stars)...BUT<br /><br />This is where the number \\""2\\"" comes into force: customer service and their notably unpleasant and lackluster forums. Certainly, part of the poor customer response time is due to the fact that the game is just barely 30 days into full release, and they are still in the process of hiring in enough people to deal with the high number of players on the servers right now. The technical people seem to be on the spot and willing to help as quickly and congenially as they can; the forum moderators where much information about the game is exchanged are imminently less helpful: they border on draconian. As a result, the forums are a poor place to search for game help, to find and forge friendships, to look for and receive courteous and appropriate guidance on all topics regarding the game. The forum moderators are actually disrupting the flow of information to an extreme degree. I expect that all of this will normalize as the game moves forward. (2 stars)<br /><br />To sum everything up in a nutshell: this game is a keeper, but don't expect everything to be rosy here at the start. Play it (better with a group of friends that can support you), join legitimate fan sites that can guide you through the opening stages, don't worry too much yet about getting information coming from the forums; hopefully they will fix all that, and I will see you in Kryta.*<br /><br />*There is a strong PvP component in the game that includes server vs server (WvWvW), but I have chosen to wait until I understand my class better to join that experience. I don't feel it would be fair for me to comment on that until I play it for a while.<br /><br />:)"
1291	0	This game is OK.
1292	0	ok
1293	1	i love this game you have so much freedom in what you can do and everything is so detailed. great game
1294	0	Love the old PC naval games
1295	0	Not a bad game, but after reading several positive reviews I had expected a little more. Still well worth the money though
1296	1	Purchased as a gift and it worked perfectly.
1297	-1	''' for anyone wanting this if you download the base game, you can buy all 4 at once for 20 dollars less directly from the game, intant download... This, this would be a horribly ignorant purchase.'''
1298	1	Great game!
1299	0	"There's not much to this game, certainly no plot other than a very creepy very vague disjointed narrative about a madman who collects oddly willing young wives and lets them wither away in his mansion.  Standard creepy game story without any coherence or resolution.  The game is entirely about spotting \\""shards\\"" of objects that have only the most tenuous relation to their scenes.  The few puzzles in between are not very interesting.  I give it 3 stars because the shard hunting at least keeps you going for a while."
1300	1	Worked perfectly
1301	-1	hard to understand. you click on a clue it just keeps going back to the same clues.Might be me and not the game<br />I just did not like it.
1302	-1	"This is a \\""streaming\\"" videogame from STEAM. You never actually own anything and you have to have internet connection to play. You don't just simply download to your computer. You download a whole other service to play this game. It is a SCAM! DO NOT PURCHASE. There is no way to play these games offline."
1303	0	Its fun, but every. other. game. freaking crashes! Its ashamed EA pushed dice to throw this out so quickly. There are so many bugs its almost unplayable.
1304	-1	I bought it and then tried to redeem the code three times and it keeps saying the code is not valid. Are there any refunds available for downloads?
1305	-1	I have purchased most of these 7 wonders games and they are fun.  This is too except that are just a few levels.  Once the game is through you get a pop up telling you can reply levels at different difficulty setting.  Very disappointing considering the price
1306	1	Excelent!!
1307	-1	Horrible game, Horrible controls. This is supposed to be a relaxing game - not an anger infused trial and error romp.  Touchscreen controls are not responsive, motion control is clumsy and you move at a SLOW pace.  Oh, want to speed up in motion control mode? Guess what - you have to use the touch screen instead of simply titling your psp vita.  Horrrible. Do not buy
1308	-1	Same crap all over again in ultimate team. scripted\fixed to give the opponent the advantage when you have a much better team.  the same nonsense that happens near the goal with the goal bouncing all over only to find that your players scored on their own goal.  I filed for a refund after few games with the same problems as 13 and 14. (bought it from origin at which they offer 24 hours period to ask for a refund. and I did).    tried PES 15 demo and it's great. much better than fifa and its fixed/scripted ultimate team. try out the demo (only on console).
1309	1	Absolutely  love it
1310	1	When I ordered this I had no issues receiving the code and redeeming it. Other than that I really enjoyed the game I bought with it :)
1311	0	While this game has a million flaws and annoyances, it still has a large attention to detail and brings back some of the awesome nostalgia of the alien series. The AI is brain dead and the game is as linear and scripted as hell.<br /><br />Get in on sale (i paid 2 bucks) if your a fa, haven't tried the multiplayer, doubt there are any players anyways
1312	-1	Don't buy it if you have to use Steam.  I bought it and Steam still has not activated the game.  It's been 2 days and Steam hasn't even gotten back with me.  Buyer beware.
1313	-1	"I'm a huge fan of the SimCity franchise. I've spent countless hours on every title with SimCity 4 being my favorite. 10 years later, EA and Maxis decide to reboot this beloved franchise.Being the huge fan that I am, I imediately preordered the Digital Deluxe edition on Origin. I also participated in all three betas.<br /><br />My personal take on this game is as follows: The game lacks almost everything. The required internet connection is a big turnoff. The graphics are rather \\""cartoonish\\"" and seem fake to me. The region size is ridiculously small and there is a huge gap between each city, making very unrealistic regions. I gave this game 1 star because I believe EA made this game without any input from the SimCity community. In my opinion SIMCITY IS A WASTE OF MONEY! This game is a slap in the face to all of us who cherished past SimCity titles!"
1314	0	I have been a Sims gamer since the beginning. And while the interface has a lot of potential, the initial game is a rather boring. What makes Sims fun for me is the out of the ordinary life experiences that admittedly have historically been available only in the expansions. This interaction is just real life in Sim format. Eat food, Have a job, Shower, Work out, Use the bathroom etc. I already do those things. Pretending to do those things is not very exciting. These things were new and interesting in the original versions. But the novelty wore off by Sims 2. I was hoping for more interesting world and people interactions. I don't like the world layout. I liked being able to switch back and forth between Sims that were spread across the town doing their own individual thing. I also miss the ability to adjust the colors manually for hair, skintone, and all the buildable and buyable items. Now you are limited to the 5 or so choices and there is no customization.
1315	0	This is a good game.  After a while, it is redundant, but if your looking for a simple distraction, this is it.
1316	0	It's my nine year old's money that he either earned or received via a gift card.  Hard to watch him spend it on worthless garbage like this but can't argue with the convenience.
1317	1	Great
1318	1	Good game! Has a lot of customization options, and the AI Is pretty good too! The only real issue is that it starts to lag when you have a lot of roller coasters, and other rides. Other than that, great game!
1319	1	Nice.
1320	-1	This download contains a virus and you will not be able to play it on windows XP! Piece of crap!
1321	1	I bought this game because I wanted more out of my PS4 and he next gen. Seems like games are coming out so slowly and nothing really has wowed me yet. This game has fantastic graphics and a pretty cool story, but gameplay wise it's p repetitive. The nemesis system is super fun and def adds a new element. I also stopped playing on one of the earlier missions, so maybe there's more to it and I just haven't gotten there yet. It's good, but something is lacking in the depth of gameplay for me.
1322	0	This is a good way to pass the day away if you are looking for something to last a while. I love the starting tips for first time players that you can turn off later. So many choices for different leaders and different play styles. There are different options how you can win the game from domination to culture. But as the title suggests, it's great for solo play. However I have found a few bugs when it comes to multiplayers. Whether it is local (playing at home with my fianc√©e on his computer) or playing over the internet with friends, It will sometimes crash and you lose the game. Also, since this game can take a while, even with multiple players, saving the game is ok solo but once you close the game, saved or not, you can't retrieve the same game. So when playing with multiple people, be prepared for a long day where you know you can conquer the game in a short time.
1323	1	This has to be by far the best deal for Speed Boost since the Boost sale in Poland.I commend EA and Amazon for offering this amazing deal to NFSW players.Hurry up and get yours before they dissapear!
1324	0	Fun game to play, but WAY too short and a bit anticlimactic
1325	1	awesome game
1326	0	I don't like giving reviews for games that I have not played but the reason I give it one star is because I was unable to download it from Amazon.
1327	0	I love the Secret Files games. But this was much shorter than the other games and the puzzles were not as good.
1328	0	This is ok but it doesnt really have that much with it.  It's not the best expansion they have ever put out.
1329	-1	"Once upon a time, SimCity was the king of simulator games. Maxis and Wil Wright built a thing of beauty and complexity in the first titles, and the series had hallowed ground in most gamer's eyes. That has now been destroyed by a few bad ideas ruining what should have been a slam-dunk release. The reason is simple... the game does not work. Choices made by the development and management teams to make it \\""always online\\"" and interconnected, and then by not having the proper infrastructure to make it work, made this a $60 (or $80) money sink. Buying it now means you're giving money away and not getting a usable product in return.<br /><br />Maybe there's a good game underneath this mess, but currently, you're not able to find out. The direction that EA has taken to make everything \\""multiplayer\\"" has ruined another series. Save your money. Buy something else."
1330	0	The games are great<br /><br />Im very unhappy that I bought this a week ago and the price is down $10 from a week. so there's that.<br /><br />Origin is terrible as well.
1331	1	Good game
1332	1	PSN+ Is always great value, I own all 3 platforms, Vita, PS3 and PS4, so I just get so many free games for this price, it's insanely good value.
1333	0	Have played all of the games in the series up to this point and the characters/gameplay/story is just getting old.
1334	0	It clumsy. I don't enjoy it. I got it because one reviewer said it was the BEST match three game he'd ever played. I disagree totally with him. I don't really like the graphics and I don't like the game. I played it for about 2 hours (at different times) and could never get into it. I wish I hadn't bought it.
1335	0	this is premium but its not premium premium i have to wait till the 19th to play the end game dlc but people who purchased the real premium get it the 12th some bs i bought, bf3 for 50, back to karland for 15, and premium for 30 or 25 thats 100$ rate there now bf4 is coming out these games are beginning to scam like crazy this will be my last purchase i will illegaly download for now on and play on cracked servers thats what it has come to they have bleeded my bank account dry
1336	0	I liked the fact that i got experience for exploring. I love doing little more than uncovering maps. The graphics are nice and the combat fun. I shelved it before trying the PVP unfortunately. It is a good game but there is nothing exciting enough to make me say &#34;finally, a mmorpg to take me back to Dark Ages of Camelot&#34;. Why won't game developers make a great game like that again? My fingers are crossed for Elder Scrolls Online.
1337	1	I've been playing many MMOs these years like WOW , EVE , Rift and Lord of the Ring online..etc<br />And this game is a quite unique gem, full video of main story quests and action quests to introduce you into the game.<br />Sabotage quests are quite different than other games, and side quests can lead you to another important place.<br />The instances are challenging, and the skills are total free. There are no professions only decks.<br />Playing this game is just like returning the WOW-ob time.<br /><br />I wish I can give it 9.0/10 score, but there is no half star in Amazon.<br />It's not a perfect MMO, pity it still has some flaws :<br /><br />1. Only one portal per map , some maps are quite big and you just run & run<br />2. Limited quests to receive so you must run again to take other quests<br />3. Limited active/passive skills to use at same time<br />4. Same maps, same quests if you wanna start another new character<br /><br />Even with these flaws , it's still a great MMO worth you trying
1338	-1	Never got the game or it would not play on my machine It has been months ago that I bought it. To long to remember what happened Its a real shame because I really like pirate games.
1339	-1	I bought this for my son and he entered it and it did not work right. He only was able to use 320 of the points and the rest disappeared. I would not purchase them again on amazon. I was extremely disappointed.
1340	0	A lot of people have been shooting this game down but it's not really that bad, it's just mediocre at best. Graphics are a bit out-dated, A.I. is often really shoddy, but I'm having a blast.
1341	1	Couldn't recommend it more highly.  Addictive.  The randomness would be the only negative, but even then I don't feel like it's a drawback, really.
1342	0	Odd mixture, a few were OK for older games, most not so  good, Just a matter of taste  or lack of.
1343	-1	I also have downloaded this game three times and the curser problems won't go away. The curser blinks like mad and makes playing the game impossible.  Can anyone suggest what the solution may be?
1344	0	The visuals are of course better than the first Alice, but Madness Returns just doesn't have the *personality* of its predecessor. Lots of potential, but it falls a bit short of &#34;delightful and enthralling,&#34; without going dark enough to make up for it.
1345	-1	I'm Seriously a huge aliens fan, and what can I say.<br />I wanted to support Gearbox, Aliens and was oh so<br />hopeful that they really put in all the effort that they<br />had been advertising, but to no avail the game was<br />horrible, and I mean retarded. I feel like the really<br />did lie to us, if you look back at all the adverts you'll<br />see how much they pumped it up and for what?!<br />I think the marine that suicided himself in the umbilical<br />is a prelude to how I felt as i played the single player,<br />&#34;just kill me!&#34; But the worst kick in the balls was the end.<br />I didn't even finish the game because I felt like I really<br />didn't want to regret my purchase. At this point I am going to<br />ask Amazon if i can have my money back. From this day<br />forth I will never buy another Gearbox game ever.<br />Randy Pitchford really is a marketing genius, thanks for nothing<br />Randy.
1346	0	Can't right a legit review as I haven't even played it yet. Just watch out as origin is pretty much terrible. Bought the game days ago and downloading is still at ~20%. If I don't pause it and restart origin every 2% or so, it freezes my computer and I have to restart (both the computer and the download). Definitely wouldn't recommend this if you want to play right away.
1347	1	all is good
1348	1	I love so much this!!! :o)<br />I buy, i receive, i play, i love it. And again, and again, and again, ...<br /><br />One more time, one more year.
1349	0	For what I payed it isn't that good. Being an older game it doesn't have as much options as the newer games. But the newer games cost $50 to $60 and I'm not to keen on paying that much money for a game. You do get a lot for your money in this purchase. So it's alright.
1350	0	If you are more interested in running PvP battles online constantly, it may be worth your money. I found it to be severely lacking in content, i.e. single player missions, which is sad considering the potential this game displays in its graphics/concepts etc. The storyline/s are very brief, and I feel this game considering the content it makes available is not worth the 40$ I paid. A similar game I have purchased, for the same amount of money, has 3 times the available missions, with a rich and varied storyline centered around a compounding technological advance that carries through the entire chain, as well as the free online PvP options. Just as I was getting into it, it was over.
1351	0	The game is okay at first, but is so basic and there doesn't seem to be any options for advanced play.
1352	0	1.)  Although it is fun it has problems, mainly with the driving part. I've been playing NASCAR games as long as I've lived. I started with Nascar Thunder 2004 on pc. Then transitioned over to Nascar Simracing for pc. Then came the console's. I got Nascar 08 for PS2. After That I went over to NASCAR the Game for Wii (Yes, I know it's a Wii). From there I got the last game since I got this one, NASCAR inside line for Wii. So, yah I have lots of experience.<br />2.) My first reaction to this game was tons of excitement. The game took about 7 hours to download (which is great because my down is on average .30mbps). Once it finished I hooked up my laptop to my TV with an hdmi, got an usb keyboard and mouse, and got my GameStop steering wheel. When the game started I noticed it didn't go into a complete full screen, it went into a screen kind of like when your browser is where you had your X and minus. It also showed the task bar at the bottom. I fixed that by auto hiding it.<br />3.) I went straight to a practice run at Daytona with my favorite driver Martin Truex Jr. I changed the controls to the wheel and took off. The steering was AWFUL. I had to yank it to get into the turns and I looked like I was driving drunk. After some time playing with assists and sensitivity I got it quite a bit better. Although it was still difficult I fixed it with HUGE wedge adjustment and a track bar change.<br />4.) Next came to my career. I (for some odd reason) skipped the Indy test and went to Daytona. Finished 6th in the duel and somehow got the pole for the 500. I started the race and spun the tires like crazy. That's where the MAIN PROBLEM IS. I can now restart without spinning them but taking off on restarts are crazy. It's still to touchy in turns, you get shoved into cars and wreck going into turn 1. Don't even get me started on starting on the outside. I ended up wrecking in turn 1 all the way to 43rd. Eventually everything got spaced out and I began passing cars. I played some strategy in the pits with fuel only and managed to finish 8th! The Main problem is it's just to touchy and to hard to drive with cars everywhere. I got this from a review for the Xbox 360 Edition. He said it's almost as if the computer gets a boost on restarts. And I find it totally true. I did eventually win a race at Martinsville (the difficulty was at 40). I did about a 5 min burnout and it was great.<br />5.)I do enjoy the game, but it seems like it needs work with racing in packs, driving control, and the ability to go total full screen like NBA 2k14. Fix those and it will be a great game.strategy in the pits with fuel only and managed to finish 8th! The Main problem is it's just to touchy and to hard to drive with cars everywhere.

1353	-1	Can't activate on steam.
1354	-1	I received only one key on the five !
1355	-1	It would not work with my machine as advertised, I could not update it to play all the features. This was refunded.
1356	1	great
1357	-1	After playing the game now for over a year and having had such difficulty purchasing through the in game ultimategaming.com system this, Amazon purchase,  was painless.<br /><br />The package is extremely over priced and little value for the money but if buying through the headache in game system does not work this is the only other option.
1358	-1	I really, really, really wanted to love this game but I just couldn't get in to it. Originally my graphics card sucked so it was tough playing with the minimum requirements, so I did a complete overhaul that allowed me to play on max settings. The game is beautiful, don't get me wrong but that's about where it stopped for me. Maybe if it was F2P I would have stuck with it but I just couldn't continue to pay $15/month for a game that I just could not get in to.
1359	1	I feel this is the best game to be released in last 8 years. The weapons, destructible environments and vehicles are amazing.
1360	-1	I purchased Magic Encyclopedia: First Story and Magic Encyclopedia: Moonlight and enjoyed them both very much, Magic Encyclopedia: Moon Light was a disappointment.  It is not nearly as good as the other two.
1361	1	Such gameplay! Much wow! Very spells! Amaze! Wow! So magic!
1362	-1	Please fix the graphic problem as i having a difficulty to see the ground. The grounds appear to be white in colour.<br />I'm using MBP mid 2012 OSX 10.9, Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024mb, 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7 with 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3.<br />Please advice if there are any solutions or update.
1363	1	Def a deal, save at least 10 bucks off the Microsoft's offering. Another benefit is not having to wait for a card to come in the mail, just use the code and game
1364	0	i get frustrated when i go to buy pc games on this site ready to buy but see too late its a download.i can go to game sites to play these if i want .i go to this amazon site to buy my games wish they had a seperate area for the downloadable games not mixed in with the buy games,love amazon site.keep up the awesome job ,very happy with all my purchases,customer service the best.
1365	1	godd
1366	-1	So I downloaded the game, excited to play, but can't get past the first level. Actually, I can't even finish the first level because I have an error everytime during gameplay. I am guessing it's because I am playing on a Windows 8.1 computer, but you would think with all the technological advances, they would be able to play a low graphic intensive game on the most sophisticated Operating System available... Looks like it would be fun though...
1367	0	I waited almost 2hrs and when the download got to around 70% it quit, then when it resumed it started over instead of where it left off. I don't have high speed at my house and now I don't have the time to re-download it. I would have really loved to try this demo out, Pets is the expansion I am looking forward to the most and really wanted to test out the create-a-pet. If it would have downloaded I know it would have been great.
1368	0	ok
1369	-1	Excited by the hype before hand, I promised a friend that I would buy this game and that we would play together. Most costly friendship decision ever. $60 later and I now own the worst game I have ever played, bought, seen, or heard of in my 20 years of video gaming.<br /><br />Nothing works, there are huge gaps in the gameplay, and the remote-save-crap-means that once a night (not lying, once a night for me) your game will kick you to the main menu and not save your progress.<br /><br />The gameplay is broken, and because of the release fiasco they turned off a lot of the features - including the search feature, so I hope you enjoy playing alone in this supposedly &#34;multiplayer&#34; simcity.<br /><br />Do. Not. Waste. Your. Money.<br /><br />Teach them a lesson - DRM is NOT the future.
1370	-1	Not worth the hassle or money, game isn't even playable. Amazon should remove this product. No manual or tips when playing for the first time. This game is a wasteful excuse for the &#34;Tycoon&#34; name.
1371	-1	I was unaware that I needed the sims 3 before downloading this so I just wasted 20 dollars, and I wish I could get my money back.
1372	0	I bought this game because I didn't have much to do on a sunday.  It's good, but it doesn't require a lot of effort to understand it, plus after 5 stages, it kind of get boring (I'm not a real gamer, but have my experience on PC games).  I haven't finish the game yet B)
1373	-1	"Its true, cd keys are being stolen on Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead, dayz mod.  We are not \\""HACKERS\\""!  I paid for my copy and it got stolen 1 week later, a freind also lost his key after 3 days of playing. Later on after retrieving lost key, only to find out about a battleeye cheat protector says im global banned.  This not right and will look into other options about getting my money back.  SO MY ADVICE IS DONT DO IT, BOYCOT BOHIMIA INTERACTIVE AND BATTLEEYE anti cheat, who will not protect you in any way.  Thank you for your time"
1374	-1	Wasted hours trying to install.  I am very comfortable with windows, but there is no legal path forward to make this game playable on Windows 7 or higher.  This product was not cheap when figuring in five frustrating wasted hours of my life.  I am sending it back.
1375	-1	it downloaded but can play it there is no link for it DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i cant belive amazon will even allow this on here
1376	1	Delivery was fast and hastle free.
1377	1	great game - lots of fun
1378	-1	Pros: It's a tank game<br /><br />Cons: Few unimaginative maps. Tanks handle like helium baloon on rough terrain.<br />  No strategy possible, you must follow the path while your foes have the<br />  whole map to themselves. Both campains are basically the same with<br />  the ennemy tanks just changing color. No save game. Checkpoints only<br />  few (sometime none) and far apart. Spawning and respawning ennemies.<br /><br />Conclusion: Even if you were to get it for free, it's no gift!
1379	0	Beautiful graphics<br />fun hidden objects like all the other Big city adventures
1380	0	I loved the previous two entries in the series.  The first had by far the best plot, the second cleaned up some of the action, had more diverse environments, and the gameplay really flowed.  But this one....  Well, it's intentionally designed to be played as a cooperative game, which makes it harder to get into.  Playing a horror game with major co-op elements inevitably makes the characters seem moronic at times.  They need to keep coming up with ways for you to explore things all by yourself, even if that means everyone else sits around the one safe place while you have to go explore the creepy facility crawling with monsters all by yourself.  The story was at times pretty silly even beyond that; the love triangle bit seemed particularly forced. The explanation of the markers, while perhaps consistent, ends up coming across as completely absurd.  The main character also suffers from a similar problem as John McClane from Die Hard: the first time you see him, he's a regular guy, doing the best he can in a crazy situation.  But now it's almost like he's a superhero, just mowing through guys.
1381	1	was very happy exactly what i needed works love  happy happy happy why so many god damn words makes me not ever wanna do this again
1382	1	This game doesn't need the high specs listed - I have it running very well on my basic early 2011 15 inch macbook pro (2Ghz i5, 256 mb graphics card, 4Gb ram).<br /><br />Another tip to get the mac version cheaper - Amazon gives you a code when you buy the game, you plug the code into Steam and download it through that (you google steam powered to download the downloader). Steam has some games listed as 'universal play', Metro is one of them. That it's platform neutral - meaning if you buy the PC version, you can download the mac version using the same code. So buy the Mac download or the PC download on Amazon, whatever's cheaper at the moment (switch between them at the top of the page) all you have to do is make sure the DRM is listed as Steam (also at the top of the page).<br /><br />Apart from that, good game, runs awesomely, lots of fun. Check out full online reviews for more details.<br /><br />Have fun!
1383	0	can any one help me out im trying to install it but it keeps asking for a cd ?? what programs should i use to download it windows 7
1384	1	Great game, superb graphics, too many cool improvements to list.  Lets just say this will destroy WOW with ease.  No more pointless grinding!
1385	1	Great game, very entertaining.  Took me a couple weeks to beat it at a couple hours a day.  Would definitely recommend.
1386	1	I had never even heard of this game until a friend of mine let me play it for about 5 minutes. That's all it took and I decided to buy it and it was the best video game purchase I have made all year. It's very difficult for me to go back and continue playing a game once i've beaten it but I have beaten this game and kept playing and started 3 more characters. This game is definitely worth buying.
1387	1	Sank you!!!
1388	-1	I just don't like this game.  Wish I had not bought it.  I knew I should have just got it on Xbox One through Gamefly.  Bad Decision on my part.
1389	0	This version, along with the original, is extremely difficult. If you're looking for something easy, forget about this game!! Don't even think about trying to handle it with a keyboard, only. It is hard enough with a joystick!! It takes loads of practice just to get used to flying it in the practice mode. I've been fooling with it for years now, and I wouldn't even think about joining a squadron and playing online!! I would probably be shot down right out of the gate!! The handling characteristics of flying a WWII aircraft are realistic enough. Built-in sound and visual cues have the feeling of a simulator. The program provides 360 degree outside views from the cockpit, full instrument readouts, weapons load settings, throttle, landing gear, and flaps settings -- just about everything needed to fly a real WWII aircraft. Based on how the operator sets the controls, which I have not thoroughly figured out yet, they are extremely  sensitive and one wrong twitch can send your aircraft spinning out of control, crashing quickly into whatever surface you're flying over. On the other hand, just because I've not mastered this game, is no reason someone else can't. If you want to spend a lot time working on something you may learn to like later on, then give it a try, but if you lack the patience for it, then maybe this game is not for you.
1390	0	I'm used to the Jane's Hotels, Happy Chef, Gourmania etc types of games but this one sounded fun. There was not a trial game offered so I went ahead and purchased it. I got to Level 7 and couldn't continue because I couldn't get any tips on how to increase the number of workers and what you do if you've cut all of the doggone trees down! Maybe it's just too complicated for me :)
1391	-1	There is just no feeling of flight with this title.  Luckily they have come up with a true IL2 update with IL2 Battle of Stalingrad.  If you want to feel as close to flying as you can on a PC, give this title a pass and go with the newer IL@ Battle of Stalingrad
1392	-1	Don't Buy! GTA IV doesn't work. It won't even launch on my windows 8. Money and time wasted. Haven't tried other episodes yet.
1393	1	NICE! i bought 2!
1394	-1	this games just doesn't feel as fun with a mouse. although, if you have a touch screen laptop, this game would be amazing for you!
1395	0	I was looking for a Solitaire game similar to the one in Windows 7, since I now have Windows 8.1 and it does not come with Solitaire.  This game is OK, but does not have as many features as the one in Windows 7.
1396	-1	i want my money back dont waste your time. If you do play it figure you will get to play half the time. Once this issues are fixed who cares its still a online only game that always needs to be connected to interent and on top of that its ea they suck so dont buy i want my money bakc
1397	1	Awesome game!!!
1398	0	The game is extremely entertaining.  Occasionally my computer crashes while playing and there are a number of other small bugs that are difficult to overlook.
1399	-1	The game is AMAZING. I played it at my friends house, and loved it. Unfortunately, the Mac version SUCKS. It doesn't work (for me at least). The Ubisoft Game launcher doesn't connect to the internet. Furthermore, after one and a half weeks spent email/calling the Ubisoft support, nothing has improved. I have opened more ports on my router than I knew existed, and still nothing! Worse yet, it has actually caused Assassins Creed Brotherhood to STOP working (although the multiplayer already didn't work b/c of that Ubisoft game launcher).   In Summary, the game is great. The seller is also amazing (the download is fast AND easy). Even the Ubisoft support is decent (the people are VERY nice, but the Mac support is marginal at best). They responded quickly and have continued to supply suggestions. But despite all of this, the game doesn't work, and has stopped a different one from working. Get it, but expect to be on the phone with Amazon organizing a refund.
1400	1	Clean, simple and fast.
1401	1	this game is fun and the gameplay is like RPG + FPS  so far i like this game, hope the dev can add more mission or map for it =)
1402	0	Civ 5 had been disappointing but i still find it worthy of buying to keep the series in my collection... and be able to experience the evolution of Civ.<br /><br />Going to have more experience with Gods and Kings...
1403	0	skyrim is boring and really badly made... modding makes it a beautiful gem but the game itself basically limits the mods and there is a huge headache trying to get the game stabilize. there too many crashes with or w/o modding. if they remake this game and actually but effort in it, it would be an amazing game but by itself its just wasting memory space on your computer.
1404	-1	While Bioshock 2 works great out of the box, Bioshock 1 does not work on my win7 x64 pc. That's a shame as win7 is the largest gaming base OS.
1405	0	Seems like a great game but I haven't been able to play it. Account creation isn't working and it's impossible to play the game without creating an enmasse account. Troubleshooting hasn't worked and I am ending up having to contact the company and hoping I can get something done.<br /><br />I'd recommend getting it, just hope you can get it working.
1406	0	The first 6 months of release was a hackfest, the game is &#34;incomplete&#34; without getting the DLC, and the gameplay isn't as tight as it was in BC2. (or BF2 for that matter)<br /><br />It's better than the CoD franchise, but EA is actively working on dropping to their level.
1407	-1	Spent hours trying to get this onto my computer.  Techs at Amazon even advised- got tired of messing with it.
1408	0	It works, but is limited on computer players. Serves the purpose I bought it for, but prefer the larger game.
1409	1	Fun and addicted
1410	-1	I was unable to download. Tried multiple times.
1411	-1	This product was advertised with the dark dimensions application really looked forward to playing dark dimensions again. Downloaded the product and no dark dimensions appeared. Would have loved to gotten what I saw advertised.
1412	1	BF3 is the best FPS ever. so realistic it makes you feel as if your really there. so many vehicles to drive fly  and get in. buildings are so destroyable.
1413	-1	seemed strange to me
1414	-1	Amazon has a dummy website which  tricks you to buy  s*** your really not ordering then it  shows up on your credit card and they wont reverse it or give you your money back.  like this .  $50 PlayStation Store Gift Card - PS3/ PS4/ PS Vita [Digital Code.  I didnt order this crap  I dont have a play station and when I called them  they refused to reimburst my credit card in5 min after I relized that this wasnt what I was ordering
1415	1	This is a good addition.  There is a lot of added game play.  I like the witches the most, and I wish I could just remove the zombies.
1416	-1	I Didn't bought this item please review connection irregularities in my account and the credit card who has use in those purchases
1417	1	I almost gave up on adventure games after the Tex Murphy series ended many years ago. I don't like shoot-em-ups and so many of the so-called adventure games are rather juvenile or have too much random running around pixel hunting. This was recommended to me by a friend and I absolutely loved it. I had a bit of trouble getting into it, but once I did, I could hardly stop playing. I downloaded it from Amazon; it played perfectly on my Win 7 machine except for one minor glitch. Since I had to refer to a walkthrough at times and it doesn't have a minimize feature, I would Alt-Tab out of the screen to see the walkthrough. There was always a large black rectangle in the upper left of the screen when the game was in that mode so it was hard to read the walkthrough unless I moved the browser window over to the far right. Then when I went back to the game the background graphics were black, with only the Kate Walker figure visible. When I moved to a new scene it returned to normal except Kate would have a weird plane stuck through her head. I could save the game and close it, then reopen and it was back to normal. Enough with the technical.<br /><br />The game itself is long and complex. It follows Kate Walker, an American lawyer traveling in Europe trying to finalize the purchase of a toy company. She has to chase after a missing heir while dealing with a lippy automaton, and by phone with a whining boyfriend, and an ovebearing boss among others. The &#34;puzzles&#34; really aren't puzzles so much as just figuring out where to go next, whom to talk to, etc. The game is fair in that regard, although there are some illogical sequences. You can't die or get stuck, so don't worry about that, but using a walkthrough will save you some time. Gameboomers was better; BigFish missed some steps. The scenes are beautiful and imaginative. The machines and devices were clever. The voice acting was excellent and so was the music. There was actual character development, something I've never seen in a video game except to some extent in Tex Murphy. There was a lot of variety in the characters and locales. The game is free of cursing (except maybe one &#34;da--it&#34;) and violence and is suitable for young teens. The cursors were nice and big and changed noticeably when you could interact with something or someone. That removed some of the infuriating pixel hunting I've seen in other video games. It gave me many hours of entertainment. It's easily the best $10 I've spent in a long time. I haven't played Syberia 2 yet, but you can be sure I will. It's supposed to be even better.
1418	0	lots of games to play, could not enlarge play area to fit my screen. cards were to small and hard to read
1419	1	I don't like putting my info on my microsoft account because they like to auto bill me and I had trouble in the past. This online game code helps avoid that and make it quick and easy to do. What I generally do is get this and then log in to xbox.com and redeem it.
1420	1	Good starter kit
1421	0	I didn't realize this game was so old when I bought it.  If I could have returned it I would have.  Worth playing if you are 12 years old or really, really bored.
1422	0	"This game is an acceptable sequel to the previous Painkiller: Overdose, but it falls short of many aspects of the original Painkiller and its expansion pack, Battle Out Of Hell.<br /><br />The game introduced new weaponry, and new enemies, but it also introduced new bugs and quirks (how many times have you ever walked into solid objects in the original game, and had the \\""solid\\"" objects become transparent?).<br /><br />It is fun, but not 100% stable."
1423	0	I love Farm Frenzy 2 but this is isn't as much fun because I have trouble remembering what things I need and how to get them.  Too confusing.  Stick with Farm Frenzy 2
1424	-1	can not see the mouse pointer it was invisible would not show on the screen tried to fix it but it would not show
1425	1	It works as intended
1426	0	Just a quick update on patch - I was able to download a zip file from Atomic Gamer containing all patches and I copied all unzipped folders and files to main Greed directory and all works well (game shows version 1.3 on main menu screen upon launch)
1427	-1	I tried to download this game.  It would not let me open the game.  I would only get a ghost type box and no game.  I uninstalled several times and called computer support (which was no help at all), I was very frustrated, I installed and uninstalled more than 6 times.  I requested a refund from the computer support via email and never heard back and did not get credited.  As far as I am concerned it does not rate even 1/2 star.
1428	1	It was fun, there's a lot of armor sets. The online isn't that great. Not many players compared to the consoles. Or Demon Souls on PS3. The game is difficult but if you play long enough, you start becoming better.
1429	0	I bought this because it is a fantastic deal, currently better than the deal that steam is offering. Glad i bought it, Bioshock 2 is very fun, but for some reason Bioshock 1 keeps crashing when opened. I tried re-installing, troubleshooting, and downloading updates. None of these worked. Does anyone have any idea how i can get Bioshock working? Does anyone else have a similar problem?
1430	0	No support for 360 controller. There is a workaround, but this game is best played by keyboard and mouse. Even if you get the buttons mapped on the controller, there still isn't a soft lock aiming option. For the casual gamer who likes controllers, get Payday 2 as it does support controllers. Overall, the game isn't that bad. They could have made some of the earlier missions much easier and it seems like there is an endless supply of stupid cops that love to run blindly into a hostage situation. Not for those that expect a certain amount of realism from their games. It is a true arcade shooter.
1431	0	Amazing game at first. But that quickly wears off. I've had this for a year and a half and there still seems to be a bunch of bugs. If you're getting shot at and you run behind cover, you will often still die as if you were just standing out in the open. &#34;You must have a laggy computer!&#34; not even close. I know that's not the problem. Plus, I've seen tons of people dealing with it. It's a well known issue.<br /><br />There are also new updates almost every time I play this game, either to Origin, or the game (both of which are usually painfully big lol), or to the Web Browser plug in. That gets a big annoying when you just want to open up the game and do a few quick matches.<br /><br />Besides those few frustrating things, this is an alright game. Single player looks really good. Multiplayer is alright, but kind of repetitive  (granted, I only have one expansion pack).<br /><br />Speaking of which, Battlefield premium has been going on sale tons, and that comes with every expansion pack (for $20 - $30) rather than paying $15 for each one. I've been tempted to buy that and start over, but BF4 comes out this year so I figured I'd just wait.
1432	-1	I would get to lvl 27 or so and need gem to buy building parts that wasn't on the board. hoping they drop next game  keep playing and they didn't show up at lvl 30 it set me back to lvl 1 did this 3 time. Second i tried as timed. 3 did as relax (first time i went back and forth from timed to relaxed). took the game out and reloaded it..and again   4 time it sent to back to lol 1 and was asking for gems that were not on the board..  ill be calling amazon asking for my money back on this one.(p.s.I use window 7) but all other xp/vist games have run fine
1433	-1	paid 60 dollars and i was unable to play in christmas<br />and no word from microsoft about a posible refund  or minimum  apologize
1434	1	I recommend..the code went through straight away..very fast, I would buy again, I'm happy<br />Thank you very much.. bring it on
1435	0	Looks good and runs well on the pc, but its very shooting gallery.  Console games are always like this - no feeling of strategy or meaning, just shoot a bunch of guys with very slightly different guns.<br /><br />Got about halfway through and got bored
1436	0	i have played this so many years and when i found the opportunity at amazon to get it i did not hesitate. if you like mahjong, you simply must have this one in your library. great sound affects make this game unbelievable.
1437	-1	Very, very basic. Will teach how the pieces move and that's about it.
1438	-1	I normally can make this purchase via shopping cart. I keep getting a message saying I can't purchase it through the shopping cart and it reverts me back to the add to cart page. What's going on???
1439	1	I was a bit leary at first about buying my x box 360 membership this way, then when it came 1 sec later I felt stupid for not doing this WWWAAAYYYYYY sooner.
1440	1	Just perfect i love this game thanks and i very very like this game so nevermind i love games  ...
1441	0	"As of today, two characters in the 40's.  Character development is split into two avenues: 1) Character leveling 2) AA leveling  IMO, AA leveling is most important.'  This is how you \\""buff\\"" your toon.  The trouble occurs when you prioritze AA.  Since there are at any given time, maybe 2-3 zones with which you can level, you will run out of leveling zones quickly.  Quests aren't as plentiful as other MMO's.  This leads one to perform \\""writs\\"".  Writs are repeatable.  I'm guessing, but it seems EQ2 was setup this way to advance ones guild level ?  Your guild status increases within the guild while your guild levels.  Doing instances, seems to me, unimportant ?  Another observation, solo leveling is the norm.  Much is made of; \\""best solo'ing class\\""(... search EQ2)  Yet, all the heroic quests are near impossible with \\""at level characters\\"".  My observation.  On a positive note, you can improve your spells via the \\""research\\"" function.  Not sure if this option will exist once character is maxed.  Pulling enemies is frustrating.  I've pulled 1-6 enemies, though I've targeted the same enemy ?  If you want/need to group, good luck  Zone population is low.  Just my observations."
1442	1	The story of the game is awesome. the game runs smoothly on PC with no problem! Worth buying! 5 stars
1443	-1	I cant play the first Prototype, is very Slow although the PC meets the requirements without problems, I sent two support cases, one for Steam and one for activision, Steam only said that the problem must be directed to activision and they didnt respond the case.<br /><br />If the game is old and nobody support the game, no one should sell the product.
1444	1	If you play this game its a good deal helped out a lot wheni was playing it. worth the money if you play the game.
1445	-1	"I could not get this game to work on PC.  It supports only two types of hardware \\""controllers\\"", 1) Windows 'like' 360 controller for PC and 2) keyboard.  Since I didn't have the 360 controller, I tried to work with the keyboard.  No Luck.  I googled and found that a lot of others had my same problem!  I tried the work arounds with no success.  Then I decided to buy the Windows 360 Controller for the PC.  I frustratingly tried replacing all the settings so that I could use the controller.  So I am all excited to get to start the game after getting the settings setup.  But I find out I can't get the car to accelerate!  I tried all the buttons, the zoom works, camera works, brakes seem to work; however, can't apply acceleration.  I tried re-installing the game, rebooting, praying to the Gods of controllers.. but no luck.  Short story is I couldn't get the controller to work either.  I gave up.."
1446	0	I agree with the previous reviewer, I am stuck on the locker and have nowhere to go.  How do you get past this?  Otherwise, it's a good game, would have given it 4 stars.
1447	-1	Made purchase at fsllb.com thru Amazon site, coaxed into paying for a Playstation giftcard to avoid taxes, Checked fsllb site two days later.....website suspended as were contact numbers. Contacted Amazon customer service, got a &#34;looks like you got screwed&#34; reply. Contacted them again and told them I paid my money to Amazon, fix this. They said they would get back within 7 business days. Eleven days later, contacted them again, they said may take longer. After four more days I contacted Capital One credit card they straightened it out as I waited on the phone!
1448	0	The sell description falsely includes the &#34;EV-30 Tumbler Sparrow&#34; as one of the items included in this bundle but that item was a limited timed exclusive. It ran out in January. I was not happy to find this out after 9 hours of internet searching and downloading and re-downloading the 7GB DLC from the Sony Store.<br /><br />Quote from Bungie.com<br /><br />&#34;EV-30 TUMBLER Sparrow FAQ<br />This special offer expired on January 15th, 2015 at 1 AM PST. If you did not install the DLC and login to Destiny from December 9, 2014 to January 15, 2015, your account is not eligible for this item.<br />However, if you're experiencing issues where you cannot access your Sparrow you have previously used, please check this FAQ.&#34;
1449	-1	I wish I could say I love it but I can't even it run it because Steam Servers can't handle my request right now. I am only trying to play the singleplayer but once again steam decided to not allow it to run. I am now on day six with out being able to play!!!! Steam support does not care to get back with me either!
1450	0	"I never played the real early games, my introduction was with LSL7 \\""Love for Sail\\"" that I really enjoyed. That said, this \\""Reboot\\"" is a good jump off point if you've never done this kind of old Adventure/Puzzle game. Plenty of the usual wisecracking and cheesy jokes to keep you amused. Maybe more appealing to us from an earlier generation though. Love for Sail was more expansive and there were more \\""Easter Eggs\\"" in that one too but this release fills your needs. I hope they can revive this series again but that might be too much to ask. Different kind of PC Geeks these days, no patience for games like these."
1451	0	I bought this game because it was on a super sale, and I really do like zombie games.<br /><br />The idea of the game is great, surviving on an island full of zombies which sounds a LOT like Dead Island. However, it could just be a coincidence since this game is about survival mostly.<br /><br />However, it might just be me but in 2014, the style of this game just didn't appeal to me. The graphics are sub-pay and the top down game-play was just not my style.<br />In the end, I couldn't get in this game and decided that money will go towards developers who might try to make better games in the future.<br /><br />If you're really into zombies and survival games, regardless of graphics, this might be your thing. There is no such thing as a bad game, just different tastes when it comes to games.
1452	-1	The game might turn out to be good but there is DL content before the release of the game, if they are going to sell a game they should at least sell a full game i am getting tired of buying parts of games!
1453	-1	One of the  the three games didn't not download. The software wasn't recognized by my computer, so I paid for three games and ended up with only two. The game also freezes and crashes a lot.
1454	-1	A &#34;Survivor&#34;-like game with a search for aliens?  The story in this game was disjointed and unclear.  There were some fun aspects of the game, like exploring underwater with a submarine and kayaking in the inlet, but overall it was spoiled by a story that made no sense.  I expected that it would all come together in the end, but it didn't.  I could not recommend this game.
1455	-1	be ready to spend a couple hours installing the game, then troubleshooting all the installation errors. even months after the botched launch, EA is still having trouble with this game.
1456	1	Loved it!
1457	0	The game is realy awesome and well done, very funny and with good graphics but the multiplayer mode is broken, never works. Look at the game forums before purchase this game with multiplayer expectations.
1458	-1	When I first bought the game i was incredibly excited to start playing as I wasted countless hours playing BF2. This was my first EA game i had bought SINCE BF2. So when i kept reading about Origin, i thought it was an add on that was included in the game (like Punkbuster) and such. But once I found out that its like Steam, only 100x worse I became incredibly dissatisfied with the product. I no longer play it. Everytime I attempt to play there is always something going wrong with Origin. It either crashes on my system, There is always a new version of Origin that i need to download. Their online service is offline or won't allow me to connect. Cannot sync my game to their server, or the infamous 3g download to update the game. It's annoying. That is simply just Origin in it of itself. The game itself is fun once you eventually get a chance to play. However what detracts me from playing it is this web browser to access your game. You manage everything from this website. Single player, multiplayer, your stats, everything. Then there is the constant update of the java plugin that constantly needs to be downloaded every time you start up the game. Its frustrating. I loved everything BF2. BF3 once you get a cross all their crap in between you and the game and its a reminder how fun it is. But in my opinion what holds it back is this new menu style, Origin, and well because it's EA. Since when does BF have a single player campaign!? BF is known for multiplayer and the 64 player &#34;Battlefields&#34;. Anyway, those are my 2 cents on the game.
1459	-1	SH3 is far superior to their &#34;Upgrade&#34; in every way.  Sh3 lets you set up convoys and attack them as German subs.  This one uses American subs, and senerios only.  Save your money and stick to SH3!!!
1460	-1	I ordered this game for Mac & have never been able to get it to play. It crashes every time!!!!! The best any support could do was to tell me that I needed to fix it myself. When I buy something I expect it to work! If it doesn't work YOU need to fix it or give me a full refund! I don't know if I like the game...I never got to play it.
1461	-1	Poor quality of graphics and slow game play.  Would load for a while then stopped.  Had to uninstall and re-download
1462	0	Automatic save points don't belong in Dead Space. This feature got really annoying in higher difficulty playthroughs. Still it's better than Dead Space 2.
1463	0	I was honestly disappointed in the variety on this. I was hoping for more Superhero stuff and I feel that the amount of extra items that this pack came with wasn't enough to justify the cost.<br /><br />It wasn't terrible, but I don't think I'll buy another stuff pack.
1464	1	I have been playing this game since it first came out.  I lost the disk so I was forced to download it again.  Still enjoy this game
1465	0	How do u get the season pass to use it
1466	1	Outstanding graphics, intensive gameplay, open world, nice acroabtics. Its developers say they will always support PC gaming. Thus i support them. If you like action games you can't miss this one.
1467	1	all great
1468	0	Exactly what the title says: where is the manual? I've looked in all the normal locations on my hard drive.
1469	1	Great game. true to the original w/ added features and resolution.
1470	-1	Not Amazon's problem, it's EA's problem.<br />GPU usage just drops to 0% while I use it. Heck, it can be my desktop and I won't drop a single frame playing bf3.
1471	0	Does anyone know if this game is region locked on Steam? I know that Steam has started blocking some games from being played in other countries.
1472	1	Being able to download this game online and have it be there in case i need to reset my computer is awesome. I would definitely purchase another game like this in the future.
1473	0	finished too quick.  Good game just not enough of it.
1474	1	Although it's a bad port i....***KING AMAZING! THIS GAMES IS AMAZING AND VERY HARD! At one time, and it's the first time this happens to me ever in a video game, I was stuck in a spot. No hope, no future. Depression came all over me cause, I had invested so much time in this character. Only darkness and skeletons. The I tried,and tried again. And I've failed. Contemplating failure and starting over again, I've stumbled upon a secret path blocked by a giant dead skeleton.Hope! Following the path I saw a dim light. YES! I could go back again! Praise the sun! Felt so awesome. So I've builted my character a kickass armor +5 and a Zweihander MAGIC LORD MOTHER MOTHER! Hey giant Skeletons and darkness, remember me?...I'm coming back
1475	-1	Do NOT buy this game. I should have read all of the reviews before buying it. No further explanations needed.
1476	0	One game for xp? who still runs that, also nfs-undercover is nothing.Only shift, shift2 is what all i wanted.Get an xbox and play the forza series.
1477	0	The game is beautiful.  It has a vast world, with many interesting places to see.  There's lore and history from the Elder Scrolls universe everywhere you look!<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is not a game that holds one's attention for long.  There's not much depth to character customization beyond initial creation and a few skill choices.  After a month's play, I already feel like I've been everywhere, done everything, and there's just not much more to it for me.<br /><br />The games' interface is rotten for a PC game as well.  It has a tiny bar of five abilities with one 'ultimate' ability, which would be much better suited to a console game.  Given that most characters could use well over a dozen abilities at higher levels, this is a foolish and unnecessary restriction that serves little to no purpose I can see.<br /><br />And finally, there is still a huge problem with goldspammers.  They're in chat, trying to invite you to their guild, or sending you emails constantly.  It wouldn't be so bad except that reporting one takes a significant amount of time, and worse, we are limited to only 50 people in our ignore list.<br /><br />To be fair, they have made progress in eliminating the goldspam in some areas.  Previously, we had lots of people teleporting from resource node to resource node, and would see groups of 10-20 bots farming the end boss of every dungeon.  Those issues have gone away.<br /><br />But given that most of these problems were known before launch, and all MMOs suffer from goldspam, the fact that they had no tools in place to discourage it Is rather unforgivable.<br /><br />Either they knew and did not care enough to deal with it, or they were so incompetent that they believed it would magically not be an issue for ESO.<br /><br />At any rate, the amount of work they put into the game is evident everywhere.  But we as gamers are left asking the question, &#34;Why?&#34;
1478	0	the game still missing a real tech support, &#34;titanfall.exe has stopped working&#34; there is still no real fix for this error  the game play is good, nice graphics,combat and play style.  i would give it 5 stars if EA support have a real fix for this issue.  edit 13\3\2015: go to origin, right click on the game, update, you will get all the expansions for free

1480	0	Choppy Quality, but the game itself is pretty cool. Just the quality of the game needs to be improved and it's good.
1481	1	works great and no virus
1482	-1	"After the download was complete, I tried to play the game. My computer hourglass flickered a few times but the screen remained blank. A pop up box appeared stating there was a \\""critical error\\"" and I should contact the administrator. It happened four times. So here I am....  What to do and how to do it and be happy.....  Mary Eccles"
1483	0	A wee bit boring.  Nowhere close to Psychonaughts, which was why I bought the game as it was from the same creators.  Side-scroller with simple puzzles and weak story.
1484	-1	Would'nt even install!!  I purchased this and fouind out after, I needed The Sims 3 first.  I bought it and It wouldn't let me make an Origin account.  So wasted $ here.
1485	1	Fun and addictive - good value as it will keep you engaged for quite a while.
1486	1	It works! I no longer have to go to best buy in order to get CC!
1487	0	First off, the download is complete.  If you read the info carefully above you can see that the download is 500+ Mb and not close to one 1gb. 'Revolutions' on the splash page is the result of 'Revolutions' being an add on.  Certainly you couldn't play an add-on without having the game downloaded also.  Once again, this is all explained in the download info.<br /><br />That cleared up, the game it's self is typical of Paradox fare.  They used the same program here as they did in Hearts of Iron and Europa Universalis series.  This time outfitting it with the details from 1830's to 1930's.<br /><br />The play is easier than it is for either one of those series.  The course of action your nation should take is always clear (although by the time you have everything in place to get the operation under way the situation has morphed into something all together different).  And like all the games of this sort put out by Paradox, Victoria requires time for the nations to developed and expansion is often done with deals rather than arms.<br /><br />Ten bucks is a fair price for the game.  The pace can be slow, the action too detailed and monotonous; if you want to play something where your struggle isn't so much from outside the nation but rather from the effects of modernization and has a much more broad scope than typical games this is something worth trying out.
1488	0	Be careful buying this game.  I'm giving it 3 stars because I absolutely love the game.  It's very challenging as you progress through each city.  You have to complete all the goals for each city to advance to the next city. The problem is I can't play but so far.  I get stuck in Glendive, Montana.  One of the goals for this city is to transport 100 people to the Ismay.  Ismay is a neighboring town.  In order to transport people you need to buy a bus and create a bus route.  The problem is that the bus routes only begin in Ismay, you can't make it end there.  I contacted Oberon support where I got the game and they tried to help me, but were unable to fix the problem.  I believe the issue must be with playing it on Windows 7, since everyone doesn't seem to have this issue.  Oberon support finally offered to let me download another game for free.
1489	1	I had no issues buying this or entering the code into xbox live. I received the code right after purchasing my card.
1490	-1	it never downloaded, we purchased a new computer and the selling agent couldn't install it either so it is of no use
1491	1	The game was entertaining and is a decent length.  The HO and mini puzzles were just right.  Objects weren't overly simplified but at the same time not so difficult that they couldn't be seen. The mini games had a nice variety to them also with a nice balance in difficulty, not so hard that they require skipping but hard enough they took some thought.  This ranks as one of my favorite HO games.
1492	-1	Something i hate about these on here is i can't use my amazon gift cards to get em no matter what i do i can not figure out how to use my gift card for these its makes me quite mad.
1493	1	The Microsoft xBox Live Marketplace (or store) has a ton of billing problems. I couldn't get it to work even after speaking with their support. So instead I just bought this on Amazon and within 2 minutes I was able to redeem the code and buy the game. Perfect solution :)
1494	1	if you don't have this game<br />you can stop call yourself a PC gamer<br />because you're not<br /><br />Rainbow Six Vegas 2<br />it's not only a good game<br />but is better of battlefield 3 and 4<br />especially in co op mode<br />I buy Rainbow Six Vegas 2 yesterday and I play for 8hr 39mins<br /><br />*graphic 5 stars<br />*co op mode 5 stars<br />*gameplay 5 stars<br />*interface 5 stars<br />*sound 5 stars<br />*connectivity 5 stars<br /><br />you can't go wrong with Rainbow Six Vegas 2<br />oh PS rainbow six Vegas 2 run just fine with windows 7 64bit
1495	0	Why can't games have more funny easter eggs built in? A good FPS with humor would be a welcome change. This game advertised this and didn't deliver. Make a game with humor, fun and surprises mixed in.
1496	-1	Game doesn't work properly.  Story mode does not work!  Unlimite shift works fine and game downloade ok, but story mode will not function.
1497	-1	"When I click run it, the screen will get black, and there will show\\""loading\\"". But I wait one night!!!! It was always loading!!!!"
1498	0	Lacks true multplayer is more just random grouping cant play with friends and mic is alway set to on which is annoying.
1499	0	This game is OK to me. It is a unique puzzle game. The puzzles are not too tough, but I did wonder once or twice how the author got from A to B. The graphics are OK. This is the first game where the graphics gave me a little headache.<br /><br />I do not recommend this game, but you might love it.
1500	-1	I bought this game because a close friend of mine mentioned having a ball playing Logo Star Wars. I was a little bored with the racer/shooter genre so....who wouldn't want to have fun? As I played the game I just couldn't grasp what was going on. When you buy a download game you don't get a manual, so what's expected of you can be a guessing situation. Also, I never played with legos - that seems to be a connection other reviewers mention. Let it be clear, I'm faulting the game in any way - it just wasn't a good fit for me.
1501	0	Great game with beautiful graphics, with amazing ship mechanics, but a close combat system that can almost be seen as broken due to the ease, and a clunky parkour system . To play on pc on high settings you need a fairly good graphics card. My biggest problem was that for my entire play through, the audio in the cut scenes was very much out of sync with the video,and this was a problem on a pc with an Nvidia and a pc with an amd graphics card so it's not due to that.
1502	0	Surprisingly, this isn't much advanced from the first C.O.H. The maps and terrain is surprisingly limited. The game play is solid but only in this way: If you enjoyed C.O.H. then this is more of the same. It's a little pricey, at least right now, given how it doesn't take the game play to any new levels really.
1503	0	Only Manhunt 1 is a steam key, Manhunt 2 is a standard digital download with activation key (standalone).<br />This is for ASIN: B00GJ1X1SM
1504	0	I am an Alawar fan but this one was not one of their best.  It's just ok, vampires are seen once and the story is just ok.
1505	1	Love both of these and was happy to find them packaged together. Searching for the items to sell is great fun, but the best part is getting to pick your design elements to rehab the gardens. Wish there were more games like these.
1506	1	I bought the games pack for a fiver. Since I already have origin, I redeemed the code and downloaded only 4 of them including kanes wrath. I do not know why it will not work for others as I am running windows 7 Pro myself without errors, glitches etc.
1507	1	This game is amazing and I already own these on the 360 but I couldn't help but buy them for steam and as a gift for my brother.  It's like they added every fun and addicting aspect of games and dumped them all into this.  Tons of fun pop culture references and incredible replay value.  I've had to have run through the story at least 8 times on the first one and closer to 12 on the second.  The story writing of the first was good.  The story writing of the second was intense, funny, and emotionally wringing at times.<br /><br />Hands down, my favorite games of the last 5 years.
1508	1	The graphics are much improved for windows 7, but will not be as photo-realistic as most new games.  Added units and scenarios make me remember how I got addicted to the game play years ago.  Recommend to anyone that has issues with the older XP version running on win7.
1509	-1	frustrated by the lousy download and unable to play the game. The game has received so many positive reviews I was quite anxious to play and felt cheated when it didn't work.
1510	-1	My kid liked this game for a day or two then it was over she is 4 years old, it does not have much educational value either so all things considered not that great of a game
1511	1	great deal.... great game.... next one is out now...<br />Makes me want the next one, but I probably wont buy it till it goes on sale too! ;)
1512	0	Girlfriend played it once and then never wanted to play it again. there was no way to erase data to start a new game from scratch.
1513	-1	dont buy it unless you plan on not being able to play it. This has to be the worst game launch ive ever experianced
1514	-1	Too short, too goofy, total waste of money.
1515	1	Civ 4 is probably my favorite civ especially beyond the sword expansion. it has the many options that all civ users want and crave
1516	-1	This is a PSP game, and even though amazon said they'd change the page after I got my money back, I see no sign of it saying psp game anywhere on the page. It can't be played on the PS3, it's a PSP game that you can redeem on the PS Network.
1517	-1	As of 3/14/2013 this game does not work.  If you can get logged into a server, expect to spend hours of fun creating a city.  Then go to bed, wake up the next day only to find that that city has been erased and no longer exists.  I have had 3 cities built only to come back the next day to the game prompting me to play the tutorial.  This indicates that the game thinks I am a new player, i.e. it has no record of me ever building a city.  This was a complete waste of my $60 (which they will not refund), my time (48 hours of playing time attempted) and I will never, EVER support another game by EA.  I feel as if I have been robbed of $60.
1518	1	I always loved the Farcry series. This one is incredibly fun to play. You can spend hours or even days playing just a couple of missions. Way better than Farcry 2
1519	1	A++
1520	-1	The best way to prevent piracy is to make a game so unusable that no one will want to play it even for free. As such, the folks at EA are geniuses!<br /><br />And just wait until they drop the servers for this game altogether (in 12-18 months). Even if they solve 100% of the bugs with it (which would be a first in an EA product), it still won't be possible to play it then. EA products are no longer worth purchasing. Send their board of directors a clear message: The execs at EA are unemployable.<br /><br />Add this to the Madden 13 fiasco, and the dropping of online features on EA Sports Active titles and you have a company that passionately hates its customers.<br />The feeling is now mutual.
1521	0	It's okay.  Couldn't actually use it for months because it had so many issues, lost interest.
1522	0	Not happy with this purchase. Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 graphics and play are much better and quicker loading than this version.
1523	1	This is a really fun expansion pack. I love all the Sims games, from the very beginning, but I'm really enjoying Sims3. Amazon made it really easy for me to find, purchase, and download. There are a few little irritating things involving zoning, lots, and other stuff, once you figure out how to get around all that, it's so much fun.
1524	-1	Don't bother with it I activated mine and I got $0 Microsoft said that the card i bought was defective.
1525	0	Overly complicated and long, but pretty good in general.  I certainly cannot complain about it considering the cost.  Graphics are excellent, gameplay is straightforward.
1526	0	Run and gun.  Game looks great but game play is old and repetitive.  Game crashes, server crashes, and you get shot after safely behind a corner or object.  Not enough maps.  Worth 20$.
1527	0	Disappearing Kings, Ghostly opponent pieces, The dang game cheats! but since I am not a huge chess kind of guy,I can live with this, what I hate is that it suddenly stops working altogether. Still it is fun, for 13 bucks I suppose I got my money's worth. More proof that there is no free lunch.
1528	-1	It may not be obvious when starting a new game that it is pay to win, and offered as free only so paying playing will have plenty of victims. Should you get into the game, around $50 or so it should be clear you are not joining the winning side, just level two victims to be farmed by greater spenders.
1529	0	Super easy. I didn't have to use one hint at all. It wasn't as good as most of them. I felt like it was mostly one of those flip the switch puzzles where you have to flip things in a certain order before they open. I would not play this one twice...
1530	1	one of the best platformers ever, puts Rayman origins to shame, this game has tons of extras to unlock. there are some amazing classic hit songs in some stages (won't spoil the surprises on you ;) ), the score is awesome and the art style is top notch, high production values all around.<br /><br />in case you didn't play Rayman Origins, the game is basically run from point A to point B to finish the stage, of course there are many hidden secrets in every stage and many things to collect to be able to unlock the other stages and progress through the game, it has a lot of variety and always interesting that you won't be able to put the controller down, there are many things that will spice up the game like in some stages you need to run as fast as possible to finish, some stages you will have a companion to help you out by raising up platforms or cutting ropes for you..etc.<br /><br />the main game tends to be a little easier than origins but it still lots of fun and there are many challenges to be had if you want to, there are also a few stages from origins that made it to this game<br /><br />the multi-player co op is frantic and funny as in origins, you will be laughing all the time at the crazy things that you can do when playing it with 3 other players<br /><br />and then there is the mini game called Kung Foot, a crazy football game which requires you to slap or kick the ball and make it hit your opponent's goal, it might sound simple but it is really fun and you might get a lot of hours just playing this mini game.<br /><br />well i think that should be enough to make you buy it or at least give it a try, it really is amazing and it is really scary how much content this game has and if you are a fan of platformers, believe me you will enjoy this game for sure
1531	0	What initially seems like a game that is a love letter to old school RPG fans, it is just too tedious to be fun. I vastly prefer The Witcher 3 (the greatest game ever made), Mass Effect, Bastion, and more. It is an ok game and I'll give it credit, but I do not personally like it much.
1532	-1	This game would not work on Windows 7 or 8.  It was a waste of my money and time in trying to get it to work.
1533	-1	I payed for it an didn't recieved the code
1534	-1	Paid the extra money to not get the card and get the online code instead. However, they took way too long supposedly &#34;instant&#34; reception of the code was not true at all. Not worth purchasing from here. Just go right to microsoft. No savings and extremely slow &#34;online delivery&#34;.
1535	0	The installer didn't work properly on XPSP3 full patch with appropriate runtimes installed at least on my box.  Installed on my 7 instance and it installed fine.    I have a beast of a video card and tried turning off all tuning options(there is no crossfire so that's not it).  Fan on at 100% and graphics turned down in case it was overheating...Stock vs overclocked doesn't seem to have an effect on the level of crashes.  Fan control auto vs manual doesn't seem to have an effect on the number of crashes.  I did notice that the more cutscenes I skipped the more it tended to crash.    Really fun game though.  Played through single player pretty rapidly on all difficulties.  100% in single player seems unattainable according to all reviews on line.  A small bug.    Multiplayer is like a completely different game from single player.  They did a lot with making multiplayer engaging and continuing to be interesting.  There do seem to be a low number of US players most of the time on most of the servers.  About 30% through multiplayer overall progress now.  There are some balance issues on armor vs stealth and nanovision with energy leeching.  Still really fun to play though if you only use stealth to run from place to place to backstab snipers.    All in all, a fun game and worth the price.
1536	-1	Beware!  Does not work for Xbox Live Gold memberships!
1537	0	XCOM is a strategy game with a variety of interesting features. Progression on units based on gear and experience, cut-scene action sequences, resource allocation, voice-acted narration, and destructible environments all make this game a joy to play. However, the game frequently crashes at unpredictable times. The optional Auto-Save feature does help to reduce game loss from crashes, but obviously it'd be nicer if the game was simply more stable in the first place. I played and enjoyed this game for a few weeks, but have since set it down indefinitely due to this frustrating tendency.
1538	0	The 1st couple of the games do not run well on the modern OSs but then again they are old games.  DO NOT LIKE having to be online just to play the game!
1539	1	This is just like the old Burgertime game but with great all-new additions and characters and levels that will keep you busy playing it for hours and hours. I've had it for a few months now and I'm still enjoying playing it. Very challenging and very fun.
1540	0	"I like the game. At this point it is very solid and it is only getting better on its way to the 2.0 release. My only complaint is that Square Enix customer support is about as useful as a condom with a hole in it.<br /><br />Final Fantasy 14 = Buy<br /><br />Square Enix Customer Support = Avoid like the plague...<br /><br />Customer Support will only tell you things like \\""sorry sir, we aren't authorized to do that.\\"" \\""sorry sir, we aren't actually here to help customers. We are only here to listen to people complain.\\"" \\""we exist because the game is pay to play and people wouldn't want to pay us if there were no customer support system.\\""  \\""I want to go home and rethink my life.\\""  \\""I wish I had not looked for a job right out of high school.\\""  \\""My life sucks.\\""  \\""Please stop yelling at me sir it isn't helping.\\""<br /><br />Oh and my favorite one of all time \\""Thank you for calling, is there anything else I can help you with today?\\"" even though they have yet to help me with my original problem after having me on hold for more than 30 mins...<br /><br />My tittle says it all. If you can play the game without ever needing to contact customer support you will enjoy it very much."
1541	0	But since there where no reviews I had no clue how this was going to be, I never downloaded a digitial copy of a game off amazon, but I just got this for 9.99 and my husband has always loved this game since he was a kid so I decided to buy this and downlaod it to my ps3, it's not remastered but he loves it so far, gave it a 3 because not too sure if it gives the full gaming experience or not
1542	0	Kind of like playing black ops 2 on a pogo stick. Ridiculous quick scoping, belly flopping and spawn killing are all back in force. That said like everyone else I still play it regularly.  Maps are very good. Game modes fun. It's a game. It provides entertainment especially listening to people get serious about it during matches.
1543	0	The game gets tedious especially near the end.
1544	-1	It worked for about a month. I had to reinstall it. And it wouldn't work. I got ahold of amazon and they were super great and got a new code for the game. Now it's telling me that it has an unknown error. I give up. That's thirty-three dollars down the drain.
1545	1	Spent HOURS playing this!
1546	-1	Possibly the stupidest &#34;game&#34; I have ever purchased. Yes, I said purchased. There is no value to this game. I feel swindled!
1547	-1	The old packs consisting of 3 packs being $10, $15, $20. Now you can't get a pack for $10 and $15.Each of the old 3 packs had 2 cars in them. The $20 pack had 8,000 SB. Now they are giving us 1 car each for $20 and a -2000SB to 6,000 SB. Talk about greed when they took out the Platinum Packs when the Mclaren F1 was released. I seriously don't know if EA wants money or not, because I'm seriously not buying this. They are already increasing prices of new cars and they are reducing what we get from buying the packs. My first review was not published due to cuss words just to show you how mad the NFS World Pack customers are feeling now. I can tell you more reviews are being blocked.
1548	-1	I was disappointed in the image clarity in the hidden objects not as detailed as I like.
1549	1	I've played this game the day it came out, for several days now.<br />I had no problem downloading it, and I rather like the always online system.<br />I've already played several multiplayer games with people I don't know. The fact that a multiplayer system of this depth was created in an intrinsically not multilayer game is impressive and fun.<br /><br />I enjoy the resource management, you can make a mine and watch each truck of mined goods.<br />Furthermore I love that each person in the city is an individual with a life. You can follow one of them around. Or from the map modes you can watch one of them become a criminal, then rob a particular store, then watch as a police car nearby comes and arrests them. The depth of the simulation is truly stunning and beautiful.<br />Also you no longer zone density or wealth level, instead the land value and demand for space is calculated. It feels much more fun than declaring there will be skyscrapers here. If you want them there, you need to be more clever.<br /><br />However, the number of bugs is quite unprofessional.<br />For instance you get to rename your city, but that new name only shows up in half the places it should. I'm always running into old city names in random places and the name switching back.<br />Also the chat feature for multiplayer is currently broken.<br /><br />Honestly the bugs have been small for me, and have not decreased the fun I've had with the game. However, pushing obviously buggy games to meet a deadline is questionable.<br /><br />The restricted city size is only a small annoyance. Think building up, not out.
1550	-1	Could have been a fantastic game.  In fact this game would have gone down as one of the greatest.  By requiring that the game be connected to EA servers in order to play, the gaming enjoyment is destroyed.  Even when all of the login problems are ironed out, there will still be plenty of times when you just want to do some city building but you don't have internet.  Yes EA,  people play on laptops these days and not everyone can afford to carry internet with them everywhere.  Surprised?  SimCity has largely a waste of my money.  Neat graphics though.  Shame on you EA.  I hope you learned something.
1551	1	A fun game, rather timeless.
1552	1	By far one of the most enjoyable game experiences I've had so far with a shooter/RPG game. Great mechanics and graphics, also the code activates on Steam. Get it while on special for an even better appreciation of the game.
1553	-1	This game does not install on STEAM.<br /><br />You need to buy Farcry 3 from Ubisoft, not steam to make this work.<br /><br />Steam users get cheated.
1554	0	the cards wag back and forth as you are pulling them across, I'm sure an attempt to make it look as though you were playing in person, but a little nauseating in full-screen, to tell the truth. Literally. And, you cannot change how the cards do that in your settings. It also doesn't work if you double-click a card, which in my mind is almost automatic in computer card games, especially with aces. Not a fan.
1555	0	This is a fun exercise in visual spacing. It would be vastly improved by bells, whistles and music. I recommend it for young children and old folk who need to use brain muscles.
1556	1	it did everything i expect
1557	-1	This download has corrupted setup files regardless of which version you buy or what computer you put it on. Do not buy.
1558	-1	When I got the game I knew it was a good game from ps3. It just would not download I tried 5 times same result.
1559	1	Great, Good Service, No Problems. XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX.
1560	0	I am a big skip-bo fanatic but I don't get that many chances to play since no-one has time to play the game or they don't bother to learn. So I thought this would be a great kind of median between the times I can get an actual live player. Would love this game more if the game didn't let me win so much (even on hard mode). I noticed that it tends to let me &#34;catch up&#34; when my Objective pile (the pile you want to get rid of to win, in this game it's usually a count of 30 cards unless playing speed skip-bo) is obviously way bigger than the computers. The quest adventure is fun but would like to be able to actually save a game in progress rather than either have to finish it or start that one game over (at least it's not a total reset of the entire quest it's just it's levels). I also noticed that the computer doesn't quite &#34;recognize&#34; some of it's available cards in it's discard pile, It quite often skips over very valuable and playable cards that could reduce the objective pile by some and instead discards or wastes a skip-bo. Would also like to note that the computer CONSTANTLY is given skip-bo cards that it wastes for no reason. I would say stick to a more human based play until all the kinks are worked out. It's quite disappointing the game play and it's set-up of computer V.S. human. Not a bad price for a game though but kind of not worth it unless it's really something you want just to kill time and not worry about gaming errors/flaws.
1561	0	I am a huge fan of Final Fantasy and there hasn't been a single one I didn't like. But this one had a lot of things that rubbed me the wrong way. First off, there is very little guidance to players in the beginning and left me confused as to how to do things and where to go, etc. The server is also lags a lot. I played Guild Wars 2 right afterwards and it ran very smoothly. There also didn't seem to be enough content for it to be worth the sub fee. The battle system was also really annoying for me and requires very little skill and is practically turn based the way the skill cool downs work. I recommend this to players who have so much extra money to spend that they are willing to spend it on the lacking amount of content and poor servers. While this did have a lot of flaws, I enjoyed the graphics for the most part and the character customization was pretty in depth and that was probably my favorite part along with the cut scenes which looked amazing.
1562	1	The easy way to get into PSN :D ... Code is sent intermediately so there is no need to wait at all ;-)
1563	-1	This is a stain on the XCom name in my opinion.<br />A mistake like XCom Apocalypse.<br /><br />While the graphics were nice and gave you the feel of being in the 50s, it wasn't enough to get me past the gameplay issues.<br />Boring combat, recycled environments and enemies, crappy camera, lack of weapon customization.<br /><br />I think they should of just gone all out FPS if they wanted to pursue that element instead of going hybrid like this game.<br />It might have made the difference.<br /><br />Wish I had not purchased this one, but I am a huge Xcom fan and at least have the whole collection now.
1564	1	I was pleasantly surprised by this game, having always been a fan of kart racers.  It was very well balanced, and a very deep racing experience.  Would recommend.
1565	-1	I been an active member since 2002. The game use to be simple and fun. Now it just time consuming as heck to do one little task. Too many bots, hacks, and scams.
1566	1	Less on-rails-shooter than 2, but still very much on rails. Works through Origin. Crossbow is fun, picking up alien weapons moreso. What the story lacks to some may be made up for in graphics and fluidity, as my aging 660 Ti still handled it great.
1567	-1	does not activate through steam...<br />No idea why, steam sells the game, but you cannot active this game on your steam account.
1568	-1	Won't work
1569	0	Not great, but not bad either. I got it with a discount, so I don't regret it. It's a good change after you have nothing to do in the game
1570	-1	Doesn't work with multiplayer
1571	0	I'm 25 years old and a Disney fanatic. Bought this when it was on sale and it is a guilty pleasure. Although, you will need to Google a &#34;widescreen 1080p fix&#34; since the game won't run at that resolution natively.
1572	-1	I couldn't use it don't buy it. Its a waste of money buy a Play Station Instead
1573	-1	constant issues with login to Origin ccount<br />constant issues with  ME3 slowdown(responsiveness) in multilayer<br />constant repeats inside the Me3 multilayer
1574	0	If Mafia II could be compared to anything, it would be to that rude cousin everyone has in their family, who while is entertaining always overstays their welcome and ends up making them uncomfortable. I bought this product almost entirely off the strength of its predecessor, whose old-timey feel, believability and great game play endeared me for all time. Mafia II is a beefed-up, modernized slicker continuation that misses the heart of what the first game illustrated. Americana at its grittiest.  The high points for me was the upgraded combat system. Ducking behind anything you could find and retaliating with bursts of gunfire was thrilling. The ability to carry more guns than six people could hold and defy the laws of physics (the one thing this game had on Mafia part one, though it made the game more believable) increased playability and added another level of interest to the game. The hand to hand combat also grew up from the last game, and looked great. Overall the graphics, cut scenes and voice acting were very well-done.    Where it lost me was the game's tone. Mafia II's approach to the telling of mob life, the interaction with other cultures (I get that for this time in history, racism was appropriate...-Ashy Larry voice - but still, tho -____- ) and the plot all mixed together to form something that ultimately had an ending, but kept me at arms' length the whole way. And the ENDING...let's just say to justify it, they'd best be working on a Mafia III.    I'd recommend the game for completest-minded people who are fans of the franchise. Experience it, and like that rude cousin who makes you laugh for a little while then makes you want to head him to the door, put it away and await Mafia III.
1575	1	This game is a fun  game. It's an expansion of Sims 3, so you need the base game to play this. But over all this game is a fun and exciting game, especially if one has a few other expansion packs. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone who loves playing the Sims.
1576	-1	This sucked wouldn't down load
1577	-1	This program didn't download right and would not play on my computer.<br />I am using windows seven I would NOT recommend this game. even though it is free
1578	0	"Ok so like others I was having problems running this on windows 7, 64 bit. I got it to work using this solution:<br /><br />This download does not contain the 64 bit files for some reason. You can get them here: [...] (Hopefully amazon wont remove this link..if they do, try to search for the 64 bit files with google..try typing \\""crysis bin64.rar\\"" to find the folder)<br /><br />EDIT: Ok amazon is removing the link. If you cant find them via google email me: taintedbloop at gmail dot com.<br /><br />After you get the files, go to your crysis folder (electronic arts > crytek > crysis) and rename the bin32 folder to bin32backup. Then take your downloaded files and rename your downloaded folder to bin32. Then, in your new bin32 folder right click crysis.exe, go to properties and compatibility, and run it as administrator and in windows vista service pack 2 compatibility mode.<br /><br />Then the game should run in 64 bit.. but I had an additional problem where every time I would change a game setting it would crash, I fixed the problem by making an exception for the crysis folder in my AVG antivirus. (tools > advanced settings > expand resident shield > exceptions > add path (find your crysis folder)<br /><br />Yes it was a pain in the butt but now it works!!"
1579	1	Working fine on my Wii I had another !!!! Mario World the only thing is that you need to buy a Wii classic controller!
1580	-1	Really like this game, but 4 hours into the 7th level it crashed and there's no way to get it back. Waste of time
1581	-1	"The rest of the reviews sum up everything about the experience.  Don't throw your money at this, vote with your wallet by saying \\""No! I will NOT buy or support needless DRM which prevents my right as a consumer to use the product I paid for!\\"""
1582	1	Having bought and downloaded Mass Effect 1 I played it and beat it.  And so I was very eager to play Mass Effect 2.  I cant imagine why I waited so long to play both of these games as they are a really great blend of Action and Role Playing.  They kind of remind me of a cross between Final Fantasy and Deus Ex.  I really loved both games and im planning to pre-order Mass Effect 3 very soon.<br />I downloaded Mass Effect 2 from Amazon for the low price of 9.99 which in my opinion felt like they gave it to me. There are alot of achievements in both games that are fun to try and collect and both games have alot of replay value as you can play thru them several times to change your paths!<br /><br />Also a great feature of Mass Effect 2 is you can load your game saves from Mass Effect 1 directly into part 2 and the charachters will reflect upon the things you have done in the first game also if you customized your charachter you will have the option of using the same graphic from the first game in the second.<br /><br />For me it was great to see all the decisions I made playing Mass Effect 1 still affecting things in Mass Effect 2
1583	-1	I downloaded the game and the download refused to work properly. Then when EA support went and check it wasn't listing any of the premium content that game should come with. I still haven't gotten all of the content i was supposed to even after getting help from the ea support. It would have been a much better value to buy it direct from the dragon age website instead of wasting 3 days trying to get the game to work to no avail.
1584	0	&#34;EA Origin account required for activation and installation&#34; - the very last line of the product description.  I mistakenly thought this was a digital download rather than a lure to Origin.  Oh well, I have a Steam account too so why not.<br /><br />I wish it would have been more explicit in the product title, but really its on me.  It does say ...online game code... I just misinterpreted.
1585	1	Good price and easy to use/claim. No problems at all. 100% recommended.
1586	-1	I have to agree with some of my fellow posters here...DON'T BUY THIS!<br /><br />One person gave a very detailed review on what is wrong with this individually, so no need for me to rehash all that. It is buggy and not well-balanced.<br /><br />And the biggest piece of advice I can give ANYBODY thinking about trying the Civilization game series - Just STAY AWAY from Civ V all together!! Civ IV + Beyond the Sword expansion pack is FAR MORE stable, playable and enjoyable. There are TONS of mods for the Civ IV game.<br /><br />If it be known, every since 2K Games got their hands on the Civ series (since Civ IV), they have bungled many things. It took the Civ IV game two years to be fully playable and fun. So, again, if you want to give the Civ series a spin, definitely go Civ IV as it will give you greater pleasure than Civ V. And for those that think it will not be as good as Civ V, don't fool yourself into thinking that - the graphics are wonderful and your options are plentiful.<br /><br />As a sidenote, I actually had a buddy that wanted to try Civ V. I told him not to but he didn't listen. He went out and bought it and started complaining right away, with the first two weeks of owning it, had it didn't seem fun or it was buggy or it didn't play right, etc. Strangely enough, I loaned him my Civ IV game and he LOVED IT!
1587	-1	I would NOT recommend this title. the manual is very very poorly written, graphic's  not well at all<br />and I found, like so many others, that the package is far better than what is inside. not much good to say about this one.
1588	-1	I've been a Civ fan and PC gamer for 15+ years and this has to be the worst purchase I've ever made.  The game would be great if I didn't have to update Steam every time the game crashes for updates to a game that never should have been released.  I'm not one to complain, and this is the first time I've ever posted a negative review, but I've had 9 crashes in 3 hours....what a waste!!  IF AND WHEN.....all the bugs are worked out.... then I would recommend the game as it has some neat features Civ 4 didn't have.  Until then, please save yourself the frustration and don't waste your money!!!!
1589	0	While it was nostalgic to return to this video game, the memory of its gameplay was more stellar than its reality.  The barbarian struggles at times to hit an enemy even when one is right in front of him (the best bet for accuracy is the dwarf; though even his mighty axe fails to cleave enemies directly in his path).  As further evidence the game 'sights' are off is the fact that you can pick up an enemy to launch...only to have them pass through a second enemy in the projectile path.<br /><br />Overall, fun for a brief while, but once you've played &#34;Golden Axe&#34; a few times, the thrill is gone.
1590	0	Really I like it it's awesome keep going body
1591	0	Please make it so the xbox currency can be used to buy xbox live subscriptions it's so stupid how you can only buy games,movies,dlc etc..,but you can't buy the xbox live subscription so i can play games online face palm.
1592	1	We got this for my wife, who loves The Sims 3, and she's really enjoyed this expansion pack. In fact, I've enjoyed watching her play it. I asked her what some of her favorite aspects of the expansion are. Here they are:<br />-There are now wildlife such as snakes and deer<br />-You can collect certain wildlife, like turtles<br />-Not only are there horses, but there are also unicorns<br />-Horse jumps can be adjusted to the horse's skill level<br />-Not only can you control your pets, but they have wishes too<br />-Neighbors can have a litter of dogs or cats and can invite you over to adopt one<br />-Pets can damage objects, like cats scratching furniture<br /><br />Overall, I've heard nothing but good things about this expansion. I'd say it is worthy of 5 stars. Hope you enjoy it!
1593	-1	I tried for about 30 minutes and finally got a friend who is very computer savvey .... he said this is a bogus cd  when he had a bug warning come up several times. He destroyed the cd and had to uninstall  HE tried to figure out what was wrong with it. POOR PRODUCT DONT BUY BUG WARNING when installation is attempted
1594	1	I enjoyed this game it went quick but it still had challenges, I would play it again getting my friend hooked on HO games she comes over just to play them.
1595	1	Easiest purchase to make & use.
1596	-1	black screen of death .Try it
1597	-1	The down load was fast and easy however the flippers were not in sync with the game so I contacted the Help Line. The response was quick and it explained that only some graphic cards experience this problem and they were working on a fix and would let me know when it was done. That was Feb 24 and I have not heard from them yet. I do not use the game and will not until it works the way it was intended.
1598	0	This was semi entertaining but not one of my favorites. The map was a little confusing and like others said the ending wasn't good. I probably won't buy the sequel.
1599	1	good product
1600	-1	I bought this thinking it would work just like other games on my Mac. Not the case. Apparently you have to also download and subscribe to STEAM. Now I have a terrible middleman shooting ads in my face when all I want to do is click the game and play. My other games were downloaded from Mac App store and have worked like they should, without some wasteful series of login hurdles required to play the game. I HIGHLY recommend you pay the extra $5 bucks and get it from the Mac App store. This is not good business on Amazon's part to trick customers into the gauntlet of advertisement after they already take our money for the product. I want to play my game NOT SET UP ANOTHER SOCIAL PROFILE WITH SOME ONLINE GAME PEDDLER. Very unhappy about this. I wasted $15 bucks on a game I can't even play. Oh yea, once I downloaded steam and tried to play, the steam app just froze up and wouldn't let me play the game. I have been an Amazon customer for a long time now and am beginning to lose faith in their investor first mentality.
1601	1	Worked great! Thank you
1602	0	It was felt that it was difficult on the way.<br />However, I feel even artistry in production.<br />It becomes a masterpiece when there is a movie at intervals.
1603	1	I was happy to get such a great savings for this.  I wouldn't have pain full price for this. Happy kids
1604	1	It's free to play, but I have no problem kicking in some cash to buy cosmetic items to support this game.
1605	1	I love that I don't have to leave my house, just to pick one of these up anymore. So much faster!
1606	-1	It downloaded but would not start , very disappointed . There fore , I lost $ 4.99 . , in transaction .
1607	0	Works, still buggy, not Amazon problem though.
1608	-1	I have purchased most of the Sims 3 expansions from the Amazon digital download without issue. However, I have had repeated issues getting this purchase to load. I have run into the same issues the commenters below have. Save yourself some trouble. Also, the download is about $20 cheaper at Origin, EA's official download site.
1609	0	First off, if money is important to you, and you haven't already played it, PLAY JUST CAUSE 2 first. It's an older game and third-person, but it's also open-world, the setting is very similar, and there's more variety in activities and ways to get around. And I dare say, JC2's over-the-top one-man-army story is more fun to follow.<br /><br />That said, FC3 is a decent game played in &#60;2 hour sessions: almost all of the game happens on a seamless tropical map, spanning jungle, swamps, hills, brush, villages, towns, bases, and beaches, and the meat filler of the game is the conquest of enemy outposts staffed by 5-10 guards (w/ chance of additional 4-5 in patrols and reinforcement waves if the outpost is alerted and activates its siren). For your part, you can choose from about a dozen main approaches/ways to dispatch enemies, and it's possible to switch it up even on the same outpost: lure/distract, stealth-backstab, silent one-hit ranged (pistol, arrow, sniper), suppressed burst fire, or loud assaults w/ shotguns, smgs, rifles, LMGs, environment kills, turret kills, explosives. For the enemies, there are fast runner melee/explosives, midweight assault, and armored heavies.<br /><br />There's also a wilderness hunt-and-loot, craft upgrades aspect, w/ various animal spawn areas scattered about. There's also a map-revealing &#34;mini-game&#34; involving hunting out fairly-visible towers and platforming your way up. For getting around, there ATVs, cars, jet skis, with solo timer races for those, and boats and the option to hang glide from certain peaks (but you have to hike up) (plus a somewhat fun unlockable tool later in the main story). You can also fast travel to a limited number of places.<br /><br />As for the story/campaign, it's mostly a series of action set-pieces that each take maybe 30-45 minutes to do, a blend of cutscenes and action sequences that are practically expected of the FPS genre (shoot from an on-rails jeep or chopper, penetrate a pretty linearbut fairly cramped compound, hold off an assault/defend a position, and a couple escort runs). There's a bit of an Apocalypse Now feel to the first half with one nice, novel, surreal segment, but I thought it suffered from obnoxious characters.<br /><br />Game difficulty is pretty uneven, outposts are fairly easy but campaign set pieces are much harder by comparison, so you'll probably find yourself turning the difficulty up and down fairly often, or leaving it at one setting and then looking for ways to make outposts more challenging (stealth melee most likely)). You can reset (all) outposts at any time to replay them or to add enemy patrols back to zones, but there's still not enough to do it again w/ a different approach unless you really like FPS's despite all the different ones out there.<br /><br />This was my first Uplay game, and while you can register it in Steam if you got the Steam key version, there's no Steam achievements or even reliable playtime tracking, and Steam launches Uplay anyway, so unless you want your Steam overlay, just grab the Uplay cd-key from Steam (different from Steam key), pop that into Uplay, and install+run FC3 from there. One majorly annoying issue: if Uplay is down, pausing the game every 10-15 minutes will have FC3 trying to connect to servers, taking an annoying 20-30 seconds to give up and try again later. I didn't check if there was an offline mode or some way to turn off the server attempt, but at least I only had a couple hours left in the game when it happened to me.<br /><br />Anyway, from what I can tell this was way overhyped and reviewed higher than it should have been (3-4 out of 5 at best, definitely not 5 stars). Again, check out Just Cause 2 if you haven't already, or fire it back up again--way more bang for your buck (pun intended). Or maybe just go straight to Blood Dragon, I haven't played it, but I hear it's largely the same game but with more over-the-top story and hopefully less obnoxious characters.
1610	0	I just purchased a 3-month Xbox Live Gold membership (online code). My only reason for ordering was to get ESPN live programming as I had canceled my cable tv service (TWC) in 2012. The activation of the code went pretty smoothly but only to reveal that ESPN is not available because I don't have a cable tv contract. Unlikely I'll get a refund, particularly since I ordered through Amazon instead of directly through my Xbox.<br /><br />Yes, I should have dug deeper into the details and figured this out before ordering or contacted Xbox or the cable company to confirm ahead of time. And it's too bad they don't offer a 1-day trial code. But it's also not something Xbox wants to make clear, that they are collaborating with a monopolistic cable provider either. So, caveat emptor.
1611	0	This is a technically competent game that I can't get myself to care about because it is just so stupid.<br /><br />The character is really stupid, he's basically Ricky Martin with a gun, and the gameplay is competent but stupid. Basically, you blow stuff up.<br /><br />Which would be amazing if there didn't exist other games on the market which were not only equally if not more technically competent, but also had characters and an interesting environment that you actually cared about. at best, it's an amusing demo. But it's not worth spending much time on.
1612	-1	good grafics gameplay was laborious  overall it sucked
1613	-1	never downloaded and lost my money. I am very disappointed with this and do not know what to do. Who do I contact?
1614	1	Just like other reviewers this is basically an extended TV show that you get to interact with. My only criticisms is that some of the tasks are slightly broken when you are learning new abilities with the controller, This makes these tasks take far longer than they should. But that is only a minor annoyance in a otherwise fun game, that will keep you laughing if you like the South Park Humor, if not I can see how this game would easily offended some, but I luckily fall into the first group. If you get this on sale it is easily worth the price.
1615	-1	As it is, it's pretty bad on PC. Locked to 30fps at 720p. Even if you choose a higher resolution it just renders at 720p and then upscales. I know you can fix this with mods, but I can't get that to work for me.
1616	1	there isn't much to say, but this digital card makes your life easier, when adding funds to your ps3 or vita.
1617	-1	Did not load properly ripped off do not buy don't waste money no refunds on this wont play right after dowload
1618	0	what an un-epic ending.<br />I do appreciate the new leveling system.  It was overhauled, simplified, and useable.  Also incorporating spell learning into the leveling was actually fun, along with an equally enjoyable spell system overhaul.  However, it became useless to try to buy more spells: you have to be at a certain level to learn a spell, but when you achieve that level, you learn it anyway.  I guess I could have went into one of the other magic genres to necessitate having to buy spells, as you only learn the type of magic associated with the character type (fighter, magic, thief, etc.).  I chose the fighter to learn the type of magic I was interested in, and I really ruined it for myself doing that.<br />Also the two-handed perk didn't function: I could not equip my character with two weapons, even though I learned two-handed for large weapons.  Couldn't even equip 2 daggers.<br />The came could also be a bit more linear.  You can leave out the other end of key dungeons and not pick up items necessary to complete the game.  One time playing through, I forgot something and &#34;completed&#34; this dungeon, got stuck later in the game, spent days and days and after the mindless frustration of running around fighting rat armies in towns and funny things like that I finally started a new game.<br />Meh.
1619	1	Got this on offer for $5, great deal for any Hitman fan.<br />Thought Absolution would let me down but I was very impressed by it.
1620	1	Tis is a good deal on this. I checked the internet for the best price I could find and this was it, hands down. Why pay more for the same thing you get somewhere else??
1621	-1	This is very frustrating!!!!!! I have literally been trying to download this crap since 2 'o'clock this afternoon and it 10 pm now!!!!!! I HATE BUYING THINGS LIKE THIS OVER THE INTERNET CUZ U DONT KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN‚ÄºÔ∏èI WANT A REFUND ASAP!!!!!
1622	0	The download said it would take 2-9 hours and when it was downloading it said 238 hours. what a ripoff.
1623	0	It's a fine time killer. Kind of loses the thrill quickly though. Worth $5.
1624	1	very good, fast and functional. Good price. No need to leave home. The code comes on the same day via email.
1625	-1	This Game is good.. but for PC its the worst game ever.. I had to do so many things just to run the darn game.<br /><br />1. Download from Amazon<br />2. Extract Files<br />3. Download Origin<br />4. Install Battlefield 3 to Origin<br />5. Update Game<br />6. Restart Computer<br />7. Download Battlelog<br />This took around 3 1/2 hours and the download from Amazon took 30 min on a 10 GB file<br />I run the game and experience lots of lag. It takes forever to find a game and battlelog really stink<br />I was so frustrated with this game i just removed every trace of Origin and Battlefield 3.<br />I have been saving up for this game and was total failure. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR PC. Get on Xbox or PS3<br />Buyer BEWARE
1626	1	Great deal and instant code, much better than paying higher prices at the Big-Box stores! Saving money on gas is an added bonus!!
1627	0	Assassin's Creed III has great potential for an EPIC story, especially for those like myself who have an appreciation of History. The characterization, the action, and the quests both main and side prop this game up to be nothing short of another grand addition to an already epic saga.<br /><br />However, this game is FLOODED with flaws, from low FPS rates, disappearing graphics, Audio sync lag, and numerous others. All on the games side. As these errors and flaws are even being reported on high end gaming machines, even the PS3 and Xbox versions as well. The worst part being Ubisoft's reluctance to acknowledge and even slower pace at fixing.<br /><br />Hopefully these problems; will be fixed soon, but until then, the shine of this game is trumped by the rust. And the fans are loosing patience fast.
1628	0	It's a nice fun clean game.  It's easy to play and beat.  However, there is a new version and only those purchased it straight from the developer can upgrade it.  I don't think that's fair.
1629	-1	It won't let me play
1630	-1	This game froze after about 5 minutes and I had to reboot my computer. I tried again to play it thinking it may just be a fluke but the same thing happened. I'd like to be credited for the cost.
1631	0	This game was entertaining, and very colorful. The locations were very cool, and it seemed at first kind of boring, but it got better as it went along.<br /><br />The only things I didn't like was the repeating HO of the same locations. Some were as much as 4 times. I feel they could have added new locations or puzzles to make it a bit more interesting.<br /><br /> The other thing I didn't like was after you went to all the trouble of putting together things to make something work, you never get to see it work, it has no animation/video. Instead, it just cuts from the scene to the next scene. For instance, at one point you finally get everything you need for a raft, then you can't wait to see it floating across the bay to the Island, but instead, it cuts from the dock you started from, to the dock at the Island. This happens a lot throughout the game, and is frustrating. The only animation is poor graphic cinematic scenes that are so-so.<br /><br />I would recommend this for a time killer, and for the price. In general it was a start/stop, start/stop kind of flow to it, not smooth and flowing. A bit quirky at times too.
1632	-1	Its ok. Could never get it to work right so just removed it. Of the parts that worked I saw, looked like good graphics.
1633	1	This was a cute little demo, but doesn't even show the half of the actual expansion pack. The actual game is definitely much more vast. Good enough sample but expect alot more in the real one.
1634	-1	It never got deleveryed
1635	1	Think it's excellent. I have one major complaint: You have to finish a chapter before it will save your progress. So if something comes up and you have to leave the game before you complete the chapter...  Well, then it can get a little repetetive
1636	-1	I would have liked to buy this game but can not due to foul language!  Some game have a foul language filter and this would definitely increase the sales of most game.
1637	-1	they ask you to install thru origin  which is horrible
1638	0	Interesting game, and a little better than I thought it would be.  I got this at a time when there weren't any other good sales and I had a need for a new game.  Overall pleased by the graphics.  The bosses were really cool looking and a lot of fun to battle with.  Other things such as bugs and scorpions I mainly consider &#34;filler&#34; and don't add much to the game play.  The game is based on some sort of 'path' system so it's kind of like following a side-scroller game, but in 3D... everything is scripted pacing and linear, except for the individual fights.  And you can't control the camera like in a 1st/3rd person game.. and it makes for an uneasy feeling the entire time, like you're locked into this one view.  Most of the fighting is straight up melee and by the end of the game you do get some powerful weapons and nice magic combos.  My opinion is if the camera was controllable, the setting a bit less linear, and the story line less absurd, it would be pretty darn solid.  Certainly worth a play if you can find it under $10.
1639	0	ok
1640	1	"This is a good adaptation of Family Feud.  It offers nice features, like one-player or vs. mode.  It is a little bare-boned, in terms of graphics, but that doesn't detract from the gameplay.  It is pretty good about recognizing what you type, even if you include a typo.  There have been a couple of times that we entered an answer that it didn't take and then it showed up \\""on the board.\\""  Overall, it's a fun game and a great value.  It was easy to download and install."
1641	-1	I don't need to explain the nightmare that is the installation, and matchmaking for this game. Just read the other almost 400 1 star reviews.  I will however talk about the crashing. Yes FULL SYSTEM LOCK! And no I am not a no nothing teenager with a PC I don't know anything about. I am a grown adult with 10 years of pc building/trouble shooting experience. The game may not be broken. It could be Origin, or the fact that you join server from your WEB BROWSER! But I am currently using the most powerful and most stable PC that I have ever owned. When the game is working I get perfect frames, and my system is running very cool and stable. And than FULL SYSTEM LOCK! Like I said I am not new at this. I know how to troubleshoot a problem. And in this case, its just broken.  I will admit I did not try as hard as I could to make this game work. The reason for this is the game is an abomination. It in no way is worthy of the Battlefield title. If your like me, you loved BF2 to death. This game is nothing like BF2. It is a shameless stab at Call of duty, and utilizes so many aspects of COD. As a new player you have NOTHING available to you. This is mostly noticeable in vehicle combat, best example being the jet. You do not have countermeasures until you have unlocked them. Meaning that as a newer player you are forced to be a much better pilot than you need to be as you ascend in levels and get more unlocks. This reigns true for every class. You start with no utility, and a very limited ability to even play your role. THIS IS NOT AN MMORPG!!! If I wanted to pay full price for a game, and be utterly useless and weak until I have put hours and hours into it than I would play an MMO. Imagine getting Starcraft and only having access to tier 1 units until you played enough to unlock more! Its simply insulting to add a system like that to a game like Battlefield. There is so much more I can say but this is already much longer than most people will read.  The short and short, is thatthis is not a Battlefield game. Its not even a good shooter. Go for TF2, CS source, Section 8 Pred, even crysis 2 has better multiplayer. Unless your a CoD fan, in which case your probly about 19 or younger and have never experienced a good FPS, and will naturally think games like this are the norm.
1642	-1	This game runs so slowly that I can't get anywhere with it. You click on something or somewhere and then sit and wait and wait and wait for the game to respond. It's not my computer I checked to make sure it met the specs and I run other games on it just fine. It's just this one.
1643	-1	I pre-ordered and upon release on the 13th happily downloaded only to find myself directed to Origin and find that they have not yet released the game.<br /><br />..seriously?
1644	1	Good Game
1645	-1	Pleez cancel this order because it was ordered on August 29 I expect a credit on my card. I actually do not like the new game at all tooooo slow, cannot stack, graphics not as good as the others?...
1646	1	Very Nice...muy bueno
1647	0	I held off buying this game after trying the demo, mainly because it didn't play well in 3D Vision.  While the demo version was fun, games need to be outstanding for me to purchase them at full retail especially if it doesn't play well in 3D.  I'm glad I held off.  I'm a huge fan of the Dawn of War 2 RTS games, especially because they cross into the RPG/MMO realm with skill trees and war gear.  I also really enjoy the gritty 40K universe even though I've never been into the comics or board games.  This game just ended up falling way short for me in just about every area.  *Combat - while combat at first seems like a lot of fun, visceral and satisfying, you quickly realize it is EXTREMELY repetitive and lacks the kind of variety you would come to expect in beat-em-up action games of this type.  Good comparison games would be X-Men Wolverine, Batman Arkham Asylum/City, and Darksiders.    *Level Design - although there are some memorable vistas and moments, for the most part you're just funneled along a rundown corridor.  The biggest problem was the amount of down time running from point to point with no action whatsoever.  The game is also incredibly short.  Steam is showing ~9hrs total playtime for me to beat the campaign on normal.  *Character Progression - There is none.  Could've been so much better here.  Even something along the lines of Mass Effect would've worked, or if they just took cues from their Dawn of War 2 series.  You just get a few upgrades for weapons or your suit that only serve to keep things balanced as enemies get harder.    *Weapon Choices - You do get access to more weapons as you go along, but the rigidity of the weapon choices was frustrating at times.  Not being able to swap out your pistols and bolter for heavier weapons is frustrating.  Also, not being able to swap or drop melee weapons at will was also frustrating due to the use of auto-save checkpoints.  Basically if you wanted to use a warhammer, you lost access to your 2 big gun slots.  So you gain melee effectiveness for short/long range weapon effectiveness which can be a real problem in some parts of the game.  Story, character acting, and overall atmosphere are all positive aspects of the game.  Combat is generally fun other than being pretty repetitive as I mentioned.  There's a little too much artificial ammo management going on with the very limited carrying capacity and small amount of ammo regained (increments of 5, 10, max of 15-20 for example).  You end up basically running half way across a room just to pick up ammo when it could easily be replenished by a single crate.    But the game basically goes like this: run for 30-60 seconds, listening to a holotape or NPCs talk.  Hit a clearing, get swarmed by Orks or Chaos for 60 seconds of blood, guts and glory.  Rinse and repeat.    Overall the game was fun, but hopefully Relic improves the game in future versions and incorporates some of what made their Dawn of War 2 games so excellent along with some of the other games of this type in the industry.
1648	0	Not the best BF but it's still fun to play, the sad part is that is full of bugs, and whenever EA release a patch, they bug more than what they fix, only recommended if you have enough money for the premium game, if you pay for the standard, you'll only have like 60% of the game.
1649	-1	Doesn't format for high resolution screens. Essentially is useless on my Surface Pro 2. If someone has an easy resolution for this, I'm open to trying it and revising my rating score.
1650	-1	When you can play this game, it's beautiful and fun. But don't get too comfy, because the servers might go down and kick you off like they did me. I've spent as much time TRYING and FAILING to play the game single player as I have actually playing the game. EA has let their Finance guys make creative decisions about their software in the name of preventing piracy, and it ruins what could be the best game since Portal.<br /><br />Don't buy this game until the servers ar efixed, and think hard about buying the game if you expect to be able to play it two-three years down the road when EA will have declared it no longer profitable and the REQUIRED servers are turned off. Dumb, dumb decisions on EA's part.
1651	1	Fast delivery. Pretty useful
1652	1	with Steam support. don't forget to get the add on (Enemy Within). Cool factor x 10!
1653	1	Good!
1654	-1	SimCity was fun, SimCity 2 was fantastic, Simcity 3000 was excellent, SimCity 4 was even better. SimCity 5? I have no idea, the goddamn server won't let me play it. I seriously doubt anything can be done to save face for EA at this point. At this point, I hope this becomes the worst reviewed product ever on Amazon and they stop selling it.<br /><br />I would like everyone reading this to look up Civitas' kickstarter page. This game looks to be everything SimCity 5 SHOULD have been.
1655	0	Like all other trucking games, Euro Truck Simulator 2 should be extremely boring.  Even more boring perhaps than the yet to be released  'Euro Watching Paint Dry Simulator 2'.  But this is not so.  By no means.  To we aficionados, the game can sometimes be soothing;  cruising easily along the trunk roads bound, for example, from Paris to Wien (that's what we experienced truckers call Vienna); other times exhilarating, hugging the fast lane as we speed past less carefree drivers heading for Bialystok (I'd never heard of it either); and finally addictive as, with ruthless dedication, we build up our European transport empire.<br /><br />In the beginning, you will be employed by a mysterious, unnamed company, (I reckon it to be 'E. Scrooge  Ltd.'), who will supply you with a clapped out truck, tell you where to drive, what load to carry and pay you Euro peanuts for your trouble. But, swallow your pride and keep trucking because, eventually, you will  have amassed a bank balance sufficient to buy yourself a truck, your very own truck (I recommend the Scania series R (360 hp) - a snip at ¬£87,288). Then the real game can begin.<br /><br />As soon as possible, you will purchase a second truck and hire a driver.  I well remember my first employee, Izabella by name; brilliant driver, cool as a cucumber and keen as mustard. Then, without any direction from you,  your new driver will immediately start transporting goods and begin increasing the money flowing into your company's coffers.  You will then soon be able to invest in a garage (there's one in every town) and purchase more trucks and hire more drivers. If you are a dedicated player you will not sleep easy until you have purchased every available garage and stocked them all with top of the range trucks (my preference is for the Scania Streamline upgraded to 730hp).  Of course every truck needs a driver; but here players will be driven to distraction; their hopes frustrated; their ambitions thwarted; they will, as it were, drive their Scania into a brick wall.<br /><br /> Including the Eastern Europe addition, there are 85 garages.  When upgraded, each can accommodate 5 trucks, making a grand total of ....hold on while I get out my calculator .. yes here we are .. a grand total of 425 trucks, a considerable fleet I think you will agree  But there are only 154 drivers for hire.  I do not need my trusty calculator to tell me that 154 is a lot less than 425; so most of your trucks will remain driverless and  immobile in their garages. One star must be lopped of the game's rating for this mismatch.<br /><br />The second star goes because the so called towns in Euro Truck  are no more than fragments of industrialised suburbs.  London, the Great Metropolis, one of the world's great conurbations, consists of 4 roads. That's it. I repeat 4.  What makes this even more unacceptable is that there are 6 roads in Paris - or rather 6 rues (rue is French for road and they speak French in Paris - you get familiar with these things as a Euro trucker).  Call me a xenophobe if you will, but I think those responsible for deciding that Paris has 50% more roads than London must be called to account; an apology will not suffice.  Justice must prevail.<br /><br />When your transport business has reached its maximum; when  your 154 drivers are busily  bringing in the money, as  managing director and chief cook and bottle washer (with, in my case, a fortune of  124,060,499 euros), you have no further need to undergo the hassle of transporting cargoes to Banska Bystrica or any other esoteric location.  Unencumbered by a trailer you can concentrate on covering 100% of the road network.  This difficult task accomplished then, with the patience for which we cyber truckers are renowned,  you can await publication of the next add-on and so, with map enlarged, begin to extend your empire into Scandinavia.<br /><br />To those about to begin a career as a Euro Trucker 2, I trust you will be a three fingered keyboard driver.  Ugly rumour has it that some so called drivers invest in wheels, pedals, controllers and other such newfangled, complicated contraptions.  Whenever hard-bitten, down-to-earth traditional truckers meet, they greet each other by raising their three driving fingers.  If a wheelie driver crosses their path the number of raised fingers is reduced by one.  Happy three finger lickin' truckin'.
1656	-1	If you are buying the &#34;PC&#34; game then buyer beware!!! This game has A LOT of bugs that Warner Bros. has yet to fix. I currently can't even get the game to make it to the startup screen and there are a large number of people having issues on other gaming platforms also such as PS3 and XBOX. I'm no beginner when it comes to troubleshooting hardware / software glitches, bugs, etc. I'm glad I only paid $20 for this crap when it was on sale on Amazon and not $50. You've been warned.
1657	1	A great set of games that allows the user to select the version they liked best!  I Caught this on sale but even the normal price is more than fair!
1658	-1	Do NOT purchase this, it's a scam. You pay the 6.99 for the download, play it a couple times then it wants you to call a number to get another code every couple of days OR buy the &#34;full version&#34; then when you click on buy the full version it won't give you the actual price but it wants all of your credit card info: Big red flag.
1659	-1	This game uses a lot of disc space, and is not very exciting.
1660	-1	I bought this game because  I am a longtime fan of the Final Fantasy series, and also like MMOs. I haven't even been able to play this game due to an error I receive every time I launch, or try to launch, and it, &#34;Cannot complete version check.&#34; I've sent  my complaint and asked how to fix this issue to Square Enix, but I have to wait 2-3 business days to even receive a reply, which is probably due to more people with the same issue. If I ever get this problem fixed, I will more than likely change my review and rating. But until then I feel as though I wasted 30 dollars and literally 4 or 5 hours of my time trying to get this stupid thing to work.<br />(and believe me, I've tried just about everything from: uninstalling and re installing to doing the whole cmd&#60;ipconfig /release/renew/flushdns crap)
1661	-1	Easy. Read. Do not buy this. There is a reason they are trying to sell this downloadable for so cheap. It doesn't work. Read the horrible 1 star reviews on what problems you will experience and you should stay far away from this cheap blowout sale. The game doesn't work, there is no customer support, you will lose your money even though its not much money. They are trying to sell these games cheap for a reason. They are broken.
1662	1	Since this gives you free games every month to add to your collection, including AA titles and indies, it is easily worth the money if you aren't someone who buys games right when they come out. I don't think the PlayStation Plus discounts are that fantastic, but 10% off is better than nothing. If you own more than one Playstation device (Vita, PS4, PS3) then you will get even more value out of this membership since you only have to have one membership for all devices. I wish that Sony would take away the PS Plus ads once you subscribe, but that is my only complaint.
1663	1	Great
1664	1	Dead Island is a fun but broken game.
1665	-1	Online so called &#34;games&#34; are PLAGUED with (Micro-Trash-Actions) so this card is a WASTE. COMPLETE Disappointment! Buy A Retro Super NINTENDO:) Literally.
1666	0	"I liked the game a lot but it gets so hard I can't get past certain levels and it continually comes up with \\""No more Moves\\"" so often I haven't enough time to go forward. I like a game that has a challenge of course but when they're so hard even good players can't advance...it's a waste of money and fun in my mind. And of course you can get more time with certain squares....like two SECONDS more."
1667	1	I had fun with this game but it was waaaay tooo short. I felt like I was just getting started good when I was finished. I would love to see a longer version of the game.
1668	-1	Finished it in couple of hours.  Very simple game.  Disappointed not more levels.  Too simple.  Glad I didn't pay more for it.
1669	0	ok, so i installed it for my sun. it crashes my whole computer and it freezes. i have to restart it... just buy the disk....[[ASIN:B005Q1YA5O The Sims 3 Pets [Download]]]
1670	-1	You would figure EA would be able to gauge its launch traffic from pre-orders.  Still havent been able to play this game that I spent $60 on.  EA, you sold me a lemon.  I want my money back.
1671	0	Crusader Kings is an interesting game.  Playing it its clear that the authors had a solid impression of what they wanted, and the research into the basic world is solid.<br /><br />This add-on allows a player to create his own initial ruler.  This ends up changing history, but also allows a player to build his dynasty from a starting point that fits what they want.<br /><br />This might mean more in multi-player which I have not tried.  For solo play its interesting and can definitely add an element of fun, but as the game is designed to be played as a dynasty where you'll have multiple rulers over time, the fact that you can custom design your initial ruler doesn't add a whole lot to the game.<br /><br />I'd look for the other add-ons first.  This one is really only for the hardcore gamer who's played so many times that they are sick of the historical rulers.
1672	0	It was relaxing?
1673	-1	trash
1674	0	This game was fun while it lasted. Sadly, that was not very long. I would suggest passing on this game unless you get it very cheap. It took less than 3 hours to complete. They clearly were just trying to capitalize on the &#34;Secret Files&#34; brand.
1675	1	Thank you!!!
1676	-1	game frozen after using it just once not a fan at asll would not download another game from amazon ever
1677	1	Its a pretty good simulator. If you wanted to make cities like new york or los angeles, then this is perfect. Btw dont buy the new simcity its s***, buy this one instead
1678	1	fantastic
1679	1	not bad for a basic game! Its got enough variety to keep you interested and has re-playability.  A couple things I wish it did have was the ability to scroll out a little farther as it gets really hard sometimes to find the enemies when they raid your town, and that it allowed you to progress a single character up in levels.<br /><br />But it's not too bad of a way to waste an hour or so of an evening!
1680	-1	This software will not work on a 3-year old Windows XP computer and they will not give you a refund.
1681	-1	It showed up super late
1682	0	I really like this game, its simple and to the point... Serve food, Get tips, grow ur biz.... my lil girl loves it too. she is going to be a Chef now when she grows up!!
1683	0	When earlier reviewers said they could play it in one evening, they weren't kidding.  It was fun, but I finished the entire thing in less than 2 hours.  It is REALLY, REALLY short.
1684	0	Laggy servers or servers that just stop. OK in single player mode, issues with multi-player.
1685	-1	This is terrible! I wish to god i hadn't wasted my money on this game. It crashes constantly and when it does run it looks like garbage.  Please give me a refund!
1686	0	I wanted the game and have it for my steam account and it was on sale too.. not played it yet.
1687	-1	I bought the game expecting a blast from the past, but was terribly disappointed when I saw that the colors were screwed. I tried everything I could possibly think of; running it in Compatibility Mode, 256 colors, low resolution, and still nothing. It was a waste of my time and my money. I would not recommend buying this if you have a computer running on anything newer that Windows XP.
1688	1	Excellent choice when Play Station Network PSN is DOWN or NOT WORKING with you CREDIT CARD!<br /><br />Amazon always is the best option!
1689	-1	They intentionally broke CIv 5 multi for *this*??? Horrible game.
1690	-1	This game threw me off because I thought from the description there would be several different tables to play on. There was only one and it was okay, but there are much better games you can buy now. I definitely recommend the Dream Pinball 3D, as it is only $2.99, has 5 tables and they are all very good. It is much more modern but still has a classic pinball feel. There is also a game called Pinball FX2 you can get for free from Microsoft if you google it. It is for Windows 8 though and not sure if it comes for any other Windows programs. You do have to purchase additional tables for $2.99 a piece but there is a lot of them and it is a little more futuristic if you like that.<br />I did not have any problem with the flippers on this game as someone else had mentioned, but it just was not that interesting of a table to me and had very repetitive music. Not enough to keep this game for me, but someone may like it if you just want to stick with one table.
1691	1	I have been hooked on Diner Dash from day one, but it got easy and a little slow. Cooking Dash is much more challenging and you have to be quick on your toes. This game allows you to play all levels on regular level and then again on expert level. Great value!
1692	1	Worked great
1693	1	Definantly worth the money, I had a lot of fun playing this game. I thought that the game was a bit repetitive but I get the feeling that this is common in hidden object games. It only took me three hours to finish the game which was a bit dissapointing, I was hoping that it would last me a few days. The puzzels were fun but a bit easy which is ok if you like instant gratification. The art work was awesome, and though the hidden object parts were repetitive I now find that looking for stuff in my closet is a lot easier! It was fun and very entertaining, much cheeper than going out to a movie as where I live its about 15$ a ticket.
1694	0	I already had Metro 2033, which I think is the funnest game I've played in a long time.<br /><br />Homefront was good, but way to short. Alot of the content was very hard to stomach. Not for the feint of heart. The reason I bought this bundle(along with RF:Armageddon)<br /><br />Red Faction Guerilla-Another game I already had, but very fun. GTA on Mars. Loved it. Many hours of fun.<br /><br />Red Faction Armageddon-another reason I bought the bundle. Fun so far, havn't played it through. Not as enthralling as the other RF games I've played.<br /><br />Stalker-Tried to play it, didn't like it. Still look to play it but alot of other stuff on my plate.<br /><br />Warhammer Space marine-My bud loves the Warhammer franchise, but I've never been able to get into it. The only game I liked out of this franchise was Space Hulk. ya, Space Hulk.
1695	-1	What were they thinking?! No Xbox controller compatability.  I hope they enjoy my $80 donation.
1696	0	sadly i couldn't find any populated servers at the time of purchase. gameplay seems smooth and the game has a good  nonspiking fps. all it needs is players.
1697	0	Good DLC for a great game. random extra words random extra words random extra words random extra words random extra words
1698	0	Wish I didn't have to use points, but it's better than Microsoft taking my financial information and automatically renewing my xbox live membership or something ridiculous like that.
1699	1	I love to play card games, so this bundle is perfect for me. Has great variety of games to choose from and hours of fun!
1700	1	I bought this product for first time and my experience was so good. Good Choice, The activation so quickly. Would recomend It.
1701	1	I enjoy this game very much.  Money well spent.  The download process from Amazon worked perfectly.
1702	1	Excellent, in bolivia is a only bay to purchase online games
1703	1	So a week or so ago this product was selling at $4.99. Now it is up to $19.99? What is going on with that?
1704	1	Downloaded easily.  Ran immediately.  The graphics are so great and the gameplay is awesome.  Makes me want to become a farmer... until I have to leave my couch.
1705	1	The graphics are acceptable and the range of layouts OK. No difficulties encountered with the suite of games to date.
1706	-1	code doesn't work, don't buy, i wasted my money on this piece of crap and amazon.com is useless. i'll think twice before buying from them.
1707	-1	"I'm a sucker for anything related to Saucy Jack, and I definitely feel like a huge sucker for buying Jack the Ripper: Letters From Hell.  There is very little to this game, and what there is isn't much fun at all.  I got through the whole game in forty-five minutes or so, and I'm sure that many players could finish much more quickly than I did.  I probably spent half my time trying to assemble a stupid camera based on the shadow it cast, which sometimes involved attaching pieces in mid-air.  Don't expect any insight into the crimes here - my visits to Whitechapel had me searching for rats, sheep, and inscriptions.  In the game, you \\""play\\"" a dishonest reporter looking to drum up the circulation of his newspaper by sending in fake letters from the Whitechapel murderer.  As luck would have it, your visits to Whitechapel keep coinciding with the murders, and that puts you high on Inspector Abberline's list of suspects.  The only way to avoid suspicion is to perform stupid and irrelevant puzzles and answer a few memory-related questions (either I guessed correctly each time - which is highly unlikely - or it doesn't even matter if you get these right).  There's no animation, no voice acting, and no fun to be had with this game."
1708	0	Again, getting this game was easy like any other, only slight problem was on Origin's end, since Origin is a cancer of a client anyhow.  First few times trying to redeem my game code, they said come back and try again for EA reasons obviously.  Anyhow, the game has first rate graphics, the game itself, like any other FPS but with a bow.  Almost like a future version of Far Cry 3.
1709	1	Very nice game.  If you loved Baldur's gate you will love this.  Another nice Bioware product with a great community which provides additional content production by end users.  If you buy this make sure you search the web for Dragon Age Mods and see all the cool stuff others have made for this.
1710	-1	It is an OK simulator. However, it likes to crash randomly. Sorta spoils the fun.<br />Running with<br />Windows 7 64-Bit<br />AMD FX-8320 Eight-Core Processor 3.5 GHz<br />8 GB RAM<br />Nvidia GeForce GTX 770
1711	0	Alright, so I had originally purchased this in March of 2012. Let me tell you - I was FURIOUS when it did not work. Absolutely furious. I had to uninstall my sims, and then eventually I could no longer even use my normal sims, and had to purchase The Sims Plus Showtime. I was absolutely livid. Well today (08/28/2013), out of sheer curiosity, I tried to re-download this game, and to my astonishment, it worked, and took maybe three minutes to add on like a normal expansion pack and have absolutely no problems playing. I'm not really sure why this is? Especially because I was told it would be harder since I already had Showtime added in there. I say if you've tried previously to make it work, try it again. Definitely buyers beware with this one - purchase at own risk.
1712	1	Why wouldn't you invest in the two upcoming expansions for the greatest game ever made? And at half the price of the lame Arkham Knight season pass, you'd be foolish not to.
1713	-1	Even with this, the stuff they want they have to pay for so not impressed. have not used myself but dont see actually paying for it after trial expires.
1714	-1	Was not given code
1715	1	It was great but wish I could see my mouse
1716	-1	Had it spent in seconds, waste of money. Just earn it in game.
1717	-1	Do not buy this, we purchased the item, got the code and then could not use the code on our PS4...buyer beware!!!
1718	1	Love Battlefield 3. Looking forward to BF4. I can get stuck playing this game for hours. I love the multiplayer mode the best. I play with my brother while on Skype and it's loads of fun.
1719	0	Looks great, and good mechanics. Downsides are that the single player campaign is a little repetitive, and the MP voice options totally sucks. Feels like your playing by yourself. You have to invite someone into your fire team to talk to them and who knows if they even have a mic to begin with. It's really stupid.
1720	-1	Amazon REALLY needs to allow a ZERO STAR rating!<br />Took a chance on this even though there was only one reviewer.<br />I am now envying that reviewer - they never got past the second screen - they don't know how lucky they are!<br /><br />This game is TRULY awful:<br />> Mindless HO scenes<br />> Audio levels changing throughout<br />> No continuity from task to task<br />> Almost every puzzle involved shifting pieces around<br />> Gameplay was totally linear<br />> Help outside of HO scenes consisted of showing you a map with little icons indicating where there were puzzles or items you had not yet found<br />> The ending was abrupt and ridiculous<br /><br />I am so sorry I wasted even one cent or one minute on this trash.<br />And as a nice bonus, it obliterated the Start button on my task bar!<br />Be afraid, be VERY afraid!
1721	1	This game with the graphics on ultra and sound on war tapes and some x41 turtle beaches is insane, had shell shock a lot in 64 player maps! just wanted to hide get some kills and hiding just got me killed..lol<br /><br />but Field of View in video settings is at 70 and for me to have some situational awareness in needed it at 90 to see more of the area around me!!
1722	1	Good price when it is on sale. Very easy system to redeem with account linking.
1723	0	"This review will contain no spoilers, so read without fear.    Bottom line up front: this isn't a bad game, but it completely fails to live up to the expectations raised by the truly outstanding first season.    Game play: Like the first Walking Dead game, this is more of an interactive story than a game that will challenge the player in any way. Season 2 picks up not long after the point where the first game ended, with the player in the role of Clementine, the little girl who was rescued in Season 1. The \\""combat\\"" scenes are easy to survive and serve only to advance the plot; instead the focus is on interactions between the characters. The player must decide how (or if) to respond in a limited amount of time (sometimes more, sometimes less).    Like the first game, the player's choices will have some peripheral affects on how the story progresses, but the main plot arc cannot be altered. You may keep a given character alive for more or less time, but if they're fated to die, they will die no matter what choices you make. That having been said, it is interesting to go back and try out the different options to see how the story differs if you do this or don't do that. Only at the end of the final episode of the game do you get to make decisions that decide who (if anyone) will live and who will die, but since the main story arc is set in stone, we know that whatever choice we make will become moot when Season 3 comes along.    Plot (don't worry, still no spoilers): The plot seems fairly linear and predictable, lacking the unforeseen twists and turns from the first season. It's not a bad story, but it was a let down after Season 1. Other than that, my biggest criticism regarding the plot has to do with the \\""400 Days\\"" filler that was supposed to act as a bridge between Season 1 and Season 2. I had expected each of the characters from 400 Days to play a significant role in Season 2, but that's not the case: one character plays a significant supporting role, one plays a(very) minor supporting role, and all the others get 10-second cameo appearances (unless they didn't opt to go join the group at the end of 400 Days, in which case they won't be in this game at all). That's it. Another huge let down. In fact, while the game says that your decisions in Season 1 and 400 Days affect your starting point in Season 2, I wasn't able to detect any difference, even when I began from two different saves where I'd made opposite decisions.    Play time: Maybe it's just me, but Season 2 seems to play through much faster than Season 1. Each episode takes about 2 hours or so to play through, which is significantly less than what I remember from Season 1. That may reflect less content, it may reflect the fact that there are fewer puzzles to figure out (not that Season 1 had that many, but the few it did have slowed things down a bit), or it may just reflect the fact that I was already familiar with the game interface and how things worked. But no matter how you cut it, I played through Season 2 in about half the time my first play-through of Season 1 took."
1724	0	pretty much agree with the other reviews. Majesty was better, but 2 isn't terrible. Really, the biggest issues are the similarity of the building graphics and the difficulty of getting monster information
1725	1	As with the recent re-release of Final Fantasy VII for the PC, little has changed from the original, which is now, what, almost 15 years old?<br /><br />There's plenty good to be stated about that fact, for, if you're like me in that you've found that there are few titles that have been released in the intervening years that exhibit the qualities you liked about it, you wouldn't hesitate to pick up an even moderately improved version (particularly if you've been made unable to play the original) at a fair price with widescreen support, cheats, achievements, and cloud saves.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />The same complaints apply to this re-release. The 3-D models are improved, but the backgrounds are low resolution and make for a strange mix of sharp and muddy. It looks better than 7, but there has been no effort to really augment the product and it's difficult to condone. The soundtrack is in the same punchless midi that everyone's complained about in 7, worse than the original PlayStation tracks. Control is bad unless you use a controller (use a controller). There's no additional content to the main game (there's Chocobo World, originally a Pocketstation game which ties to the game in an optional way, here and launchable in-game).<br /><br />The story here is rich and intricate, with much room for speculation, even if the tropes to begin it are, indeed, tropes. Characters are rich, if underexplored, as is the world as a whole. The battle system is different and, in my opinion, flawed. In it you draw magic from the environment and your enemies and assign the spells to attributes like speed and strength through junctioning. While an interesting mechanic that limits the number of spells at your disposal and might give you pause when you consider using one that bolsters an important stat, spells are too easy to come by and the junction system is too easily exploited and leads to all characters being essentially the same. There is challenge to be found though, should you know where to look (or handicap yourself, but I don't believe you should have to do that), but I felt it on too few occasions and they were some serious peaks compared to the rest of the encounters.<br /><br />In short: Minimal updates to presentation (with music quality lowered).<br />Highly interesting story and characters, particularly if you love to consider what is left unsaid about events, motivations, etc... Great speculation material.<br />Hard to play without a controller.<br />Battle system is easily exploited and tedious for such a long game (~30-40 hours).<br /><br />I really enjoyed it for the thinking it made me do, but the amount of fun is diminished by the lacking presentation and the gameplay ease.
1726	0	It's Tomb Raider with updated graphics. If you liked the classic game, you'll be OK with this. There is an annoying camera / mouse relationship though.
1727	1	I enjoyed this. It was a fun addition to the game.
1728	1	I put on a laptop Intel core two duo with a 9800 M GT S graphics. I have my settings on low to medium (textures on high, shaders on high) and I have to say the frame rates for simple PVE questing is highly playable for me I get up to 50 frames per second probably averaging around 35 to 40 frames changes normal PVE questing around the world. It's the main cities and world versus world large battles where you see the most laggard, but I'm not really in those places both the time so I don't mind.<br /><br />Even with my subpar system the world looks absolutely beautiful. The tall trees the mountains in the background the castles in the background the clouds the open fields the way the grass sways as you pass through them is really mind blowing and a very relaxing experience. Sometimes I just like running around the world by myself pretending to be a lone traveler and marveling at the great cityscapes and landscapes that the artists have created.<br /><br />I don't know what they did but there's something about the graphics that give it a almost painterly look. The color schemes, the textures, and especially the way distant objects are rendered through the fog will add to this beautiful fact. Save your visual gamer and enjoy role-playing or questing about in the world this is a great game to experience. The little details are great.
1729	0	I downloaded this game at night and did not get to play until the next morning because I spent the previous night trying to set it up.  Had to uninstall and install 3 times before I figured it out, no joke.  You have to play around with the install buttons and add the serial keys a few times before the game installs properly.  Make sure to follow all the install prompts closely.    The maps are itsy bitsy tiny in this game.  Even the largest maps are small.  This is no exaggeration, I repeat, the maps are small.  No way you could comfortably fit 8 players on here; To think of doing such a thing is crazy in my opinion.  If you like your enemies and/or allies being a stone's throw away, this game is just for you.  Also, I don't know if I am imagining this, but even the resources seem to be scarce on these maps too; It's like the game forces you to end things quickly with small maps and scarce resources.  Interesting playing options on here though with the different empires.  Too bad the small maps cramp their style.
1730	1	Excelent
1731	-1	Didn't receive code
1732	1	Very good
1733	0	The game is flashy with fancy new, ultra modern weapons and equipment. Lots of tech gear and bright lights. It reminds me of my first trip to Vegas. Bright and shiny, but not much substance. The story is lame, and too simple, and the challenges weak. They have dumbed down the game so 10 year olds can play it. It simply does not have the feel of war. It lacks realism. The graphics look good, but I can't really get into the feel of this. The main characters are never developed, and you don't know much about them. I prefer war stories that tell a story of the people in them. I want to know something about the people doing the fighting. In the Medal Of Honor games, you get soldiers acting and talking like real soldiers. The soldiers were as real as possible. You don't get that in this one. If you want a run and gun shooter, get this. If you like it real, get Medal Of Honor. This one is also buggy at times. Never had any problems with MOH.<br />This is simply my opinion, so there's nothing to fight about ok?
1734	0	I was good just not enough that I needed but it was good but it was my fault for buying it
1735	1	Thank you.
1736	0	I like this game OK.  The items are not that easy to find and graphics are OK.  No real story to it, just basically hidden object.
1737	0	this game is nice but i give it 3 stars because like all games from steam, it is laggy but you can do readjustments in the game menu lower resolution & the performance so it wont lag as much but the picture quality wont be perfect.
1738	-1	Ordered this product expecting to get the code right away, however I got a message saying that it usually takes less than an hour to process the claim (up to 4 hours the most). I purchased the product earlier in the day so I would have points set up for a new down loadable content coming out today. It has already been several hours and I still have not gotten the redeemable code for the 1600 points I ordered, fail. Next time I'll order it or pick it up from elsewhere.
1739	-1	"purchased this game 2 times and the installer was never able to let me download the game. Tried several computers and get the same error \\""Amazon downloader, An error ocurred, An unknown error has occurred, Click OK to go to your game and... after spending an hour with customer service, they saying there was not a problem, that they could download on their end fine>>>what's going on here...??? buyers beware the downloader doesn't work on windows 7??? will get a refund. Amazon sucks."
1740	0	I have enjoyed playing Sims 3 since it came out and have bought the previous three expansions as downloads through Amazon. I thought I'd do the same with this one. I didn't know at the time that I would be unable to download the game through Origin. I had no problems downloading it though, it was installing it where I had problems.<br /><br />I have a Mac and the installer for the expansion pack unexpectedly quit after everything had installed, but the confirmation hadn't come up yet. This indicated to me that something had gone wrong, and I needed to install it again. Silly me, I thought I would be able to. The installer won't open again for me so I can't even try. If I had a disk, I'd be able to do so without a problem. I've been on the phone, without even the opportunity to talk to anyone at EA, for a little more than an hour. Hopefully I'll be able to resolve this problem. If not, $40 just went down the drain.<br /><br />EDIT on 8/6/13<br /><br />I contacted EA again and they called back after about an hour. The customer service person talked me through how to fix my problem and I can play the game just fine now, for the most part. She recommended making sure that your base game is completely updated before installing an expansion, and I shall do so in the future. I am changing my rating from a 1 star to a three star.
1741	1	The second game is far harder and has a lot more random jump scares than the first game. It took my friend and I a good while to get through night two unlike the first game where it didn't take that long. The same thing happened with night three. There are a lot more animatronics and we caught a glimpse of the elusive Shadow Freddy as well as seeing Foxy (old one) in the Service/Parts room which is also rare. Another rare image we captured was the marionette/puppet actually half out of his box.<br /><br />This game is even more fun and scarier than the first game. There are NO DOORS as most people are already aware of. The place itself no longer runs out of power but your flashlight can. Your heart will race faster than with playing the first game. Foxy is no longer &#34;shy&#34; and will consistently appear in your hallway. It's a lot more random and harder to tell which animatronics have what kind of patterns. They always change. And a little tip: Balloon Boy and Foxy team up. BB doesn't attack but he will knock out your flashlight permanently which leaves you open to Foxy jump scaring you as he only goes away after strobing him.
1742	-1	This game is crap. It doesn't have a way to update the rosters and it doesn't even have MLS expansion sides NYCFC and Orlando City. I completely regret purchasing this
1743	1	"I am not sure what all the negative reviews are for but I really liked this game. I played the first Crysis and never finished it because I got bored. This game to me was just linear enough to help me along with the story but gave me plenty of options on how to approach the objectives. That is the exact kind of gameplay I look for. The graphics are \\""meh\\"" compared to BF3 but I felt the story and came play really helped the game out! I bought it on sale for under 10 bucks but I would certainly spend 20 on this game."
