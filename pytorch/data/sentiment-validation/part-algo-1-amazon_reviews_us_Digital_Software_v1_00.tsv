0	-1	hard set up
1	-1	Mr. Meighan,    I received your email and understand you'll be bending over backwards to undo the damage your greed has done this year.  Guess what, too late.  Yes you have the lion's share of the tax market but even that won't make your board happy considering you've cost your company, thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, maybe a hundred thousand or more customers for years to come.  You have one job, keep a customer happy once a year and you can't even do that right. Regards!    Update****  After emailing H&R Block, I received an email welcoming me to Block and confirming they would send me a download link within three days for a free copy of deluxe software.
2	0	I have been using Turbo Tax for many years, and I love it but was looking to purchase the software at a cheaper price.  The price of the software on Amazon appeared to include both the federal and state program. Of course I did not find out until I had already submitted my federal return and had completed my state return that you have to pay an extra $21 before submitting the state return.  That was very disappointing as I would have simply downloaded it from Turbotax.com if I had known that and would have been able to easily upload my information from last year.  Because I purchased it this way, I was not able to carry over any information from last year.  Oh well, a lesson learned.
3	-1	I've had Norton for about a year because I was having problems with my computer and i thought after getting this it would help, but still got hacked.
4	1	Very clear, very thorough, very reliable.  Could be easier to navigate in some respects, but that is minor.  As the owners of small businesses, landlords and employees, my wife and I save a great deal of money in accounting fees by using the premium program every year, not to mention the likely tax savings.
5	-1	I've been using Quicken ever since the program I used before disappeared, but at least 10 years.  In that time the overall functionality has not really improved at all.  That's not to say it hasn't had lots of stuff added, but these are almost all completely useless features built to drive added revenue to Intuit.  This program has been consistently the most disappointing and frustrating programs that I have ever used and this from someone who has used lots of Microsoft programs.<br /><br />The latest version, which I had to buy to maintain the download capability, continues down this path of no functional improvements combined with lots of bugs as described in other reviews.  Its as if the marketing and engineering teams never actually use the program themselves, perhaps they are all too rich, or too poor, to need it.  Lets hope that at some point there is an alternative that eventually surfaces to at least drive some real innovation and customer care at Intuit, Mint perhaps though it didn't seem so when I last tried it.
6	-1	Just had a disappointing discussion with Norton support.  It seems the virus I have, one that involuntarily redirects me to other web sites, can't be initially stopped by my Norton virus protection, but they would be more than happy to remove it for $139.99.<br />Plan on spending more than your subscription charge for this product. Every time your 360 can't stop something.
7	0	Lots of things I like about it but the #4 key sticks most of the time and sometimes difficult to get it unstuck. Can't use the phone when it is stuck.
8	1	Excellent program will buy again
9	-1	Shortly after I loaded Norton 360, my computer got infected.  Spent a lot of time figuring out.  I had good experience with Norton Internet security (not Norton 360) before; this was total disappointment.  Worse, I cannot get refund. I do not recommend this product.
10	1	I like that it is not intrusive like Mcaffee and it does a solid job of watching your system. Good working protection.
11	0	"I have been using various versions of this software for at least the last ten years for my personal finances. I have always been annoyed by the fact that you must upgrade every few years to be able to keep your downloading from bank capabilities. I only purchased this version because it has an Android app that I thought would be useful for keeping me in line away from my computer. The app is not as useful as I had expected and it does nothing to link your scheduled bills to your phone, so there is no way to see what amounts are to come out of your account unless you log on to your computer. The computer program itself is useful and I use it constantly. The biggest issue I have with the program is that I bought the full version and I still get pop up advertisements when opening the program for credit cards from quicken. If you are looking to keep easy track of your money this program will do. If you were interested in the app please be aware that it is still a really rough app, I would wait a few years until it is more useful. At this point you have to \\""sync\\"" all your entries each time you log out to get it to upload to some \\""cloud\\"" so that you can see it from your phone. I have entered a few expenses from my phone but it has never turned out well and its a pain."
12	-1	I'm using Quicken H&B 2013 on Win7- 64 bit.  There are still bugs in the 2013 version even after the R12 release!  I feel bad for all who have installed Quicken 2014 and are experiencing the issues I've read about here.  Needless to say, I'm taking a pass on Quicken 2014.<br /><br />I have an opinion as to why, in recent years, new versions of Quicken are full of major bugs.  In a nutshell, the problems are caused by Intuit coming out with a new versions on a yearly basis.  I think maintaining this schedule creates continuing havoc within the development team.  The developers do not have the time to test and refine the code.  As soon as they release a new version, they have to start work on the next year's version.  You can bet that with every version Intuit releases, the developers are working on the code right up until the day of release!  The code has become bloated over the years due to new features that have been written into the program.  Some of these new features are nebulous at best as alluded to in many comments I've read here.  Adding new so called features coupled with Intuit's perceived need to release new versions every year have created the perfect storm for producing a very lousy product.  They simply are not dedicating the time and resources to properly test the code and fix the bugs before product release.  I tend to believe Intuit's thinking is to just shove the product out the door knowing that when users upgrade to the new version, they are stuck with it!  Then Intuit starts throwing out updates to fix problems.  What Intuit needs to do is stop the new version every year business model and release a new version every other year.  Then make all the features in the program fully function for 4 years, e.g., downloading transactions from financial institutions.  Then, after 4 years force the user to upgrade.  Intuit, like any other company, has to make a profit to survive, so forcing the user to upgrade after 4 years is the way they would have to conduct business.  There is nothing to stop a user from updating every two years if they choose.  I would gladly pay more for a new version if there was assurance of it performing to a high standard.  The only way Intuit can meet a high standard for their product is to give their development team the time required to do so.  Otherwise, they are shooting themselves in the foot!!
13	-1	does not work!
14	0	I thought it was a pc screen saver.<br />I canceled the order.
15	1	Great
16	1	A must have for a business of any size.
17	1	Turbo Tax always comes thru for me!
18	0	I purchased the Quicken just before starting a medical treatment that has left me very ill so I have not been able to even try the product. The one time I did look at it I was a little confused but could probably figure things out if I was not so sick.
19	0	Still has compatibility problems with Firefox that causes the system to crash. Spent countless hours with technical support, but still no fix. Other than that, the program works great. But you're probably better off buying a cheaper, older version, since it pretty much works exactly the same
20	0	"Aside from the typical technicalities that come with tax season and other universal financial changes that happen every year, Quicken 2015 hasn't really changed that much.  I previously used Quicken 2014 and was quite happy with it.  I am not a hardcore Quicken user (although I probably should) but recently, I caved and bought the upgrade, which was offered at a discount (believe Cyber Monday deal).  I tend to keep up with upgrades to software I consider important.  One feature that I did like that has evolved a little bit more is the mobile feature, which ties in with updates to accounts that are synced with Quicken.  I also noticed that this version, Quicken has reduced the amount of \\""versions\\"" to purchase.  I believe they took Quicken Basic and Deluxe and merged the two.  Deluxe is all anyone would need if they just track finances and don't have investments or property.  Don't get me wrong, Quicken has always been a good program and I will stick with it for managing my personal finances, just don't look to 2015 as a huge upgrade.  You won't be disappointed, but it won't be something to rave about either."
21	-1	I won't use TurboTax next year. There is no reason for the program to be divided the way it is except greed. I'm aware that you were in business to make profit but you lost sight of the balance between service, trust and the bottom line. I bet your competitors are laughing their asses off. Somebody needs to be fired. Probably a lot of somebodies. Bye bye Bob.
22	0	Works - sort of. They could sweep turdbo trax with little effort if they streamline their product and keep it cheap. Needs work on the compatibility, e-file and help areas - quick!
23	0	using kaspersky for almost 7 years in my laptops and PC. Having some issue with 2015 ver... it takes at least 2 mins for update\rootkit scan from boot up in Win 7 before I can click on any icons in desktop. Never had any problem with 2014 ver. Similar it doesn't work well with firefox browser (which is my fav browser) and stopped using it because of this. Not sure if I'm the only one having this issue...
24	0	CAUSED MY COMPUTER TO RUN SLOWLY.  I HAD TO REMOVE IT.
25	0	"...just be prepared to open your wallet wide before you can use it.<br /><br />Microsoft Visio 2013 is the current version of this diagramming and vector graphics tool. Although never included in any of the MS Office suites, it is technically a component of of Office (and if you install Visio 2013 after an Office install, it will go into the Programs folder for with the other Office applications in your start menu.<br /><br />Installation notes:<br />(1) Download size is about 415 MB.<br />(2) Visio requires that it be installed under the same architecture as any companion Office suite. So whether you are running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Office, make sure to install the same version of Visio.<br />(3) You'll receive a separate activation key for the Visio portion of Office (assuming you are already running a version of Office).<br /><br />Installation was issue-free after uninstalling an earlier version of Visio. Afterwards, it required that I make changes to the \\""Trust Center\\"" to enable macros in files created in earlier versions of Visio (.vsd file format).<br /><br />As with the rest of the Office suite, Visio has moved the Office \\""Ribbon\\"" interface. As with other Office suite applications, I would not consider this an improvement.<br /><br />Neither would I necessarily consider many of the default template shapes to be improvements over some of the prior versions (especially for network and organizational nodes; the default shapes have ridiculously oversized images and comically undersized text. Both are editable, but seriously: what was Microsoft thinking?<br /><br />Experienced users of Visio from non-Ribbon interface versions will have a learning curve similar to what they experienced in the Office suite interface redesign.<br /><br />If you have an earlier version that is performing well for you: I'd avoid upgrading unless you have to. I'm fortunate to have access to deeply discounted academic pricing. At the regular retail price, this is definitely an upgrade to deliberate on before committing to what Visio costs.upgrade to deliberate on before committing to what Visio costs."
26	-1	It works ok but they randomly canceled my subscription during finals week of summer session. I should be working on my final instead I am trying to warn anyone who will listen how useless this program is. The money was withdrawn from my acccount. Now at ten at night their suppport doesn't even have a way to send an e mail. Feel cheated.
27	-1	I've been a TurboTax Deluxe user for 15+ years, but not this year.  Their decision to eliminate the ability to efile with a Schedule D makes the product useless for my family.  I refuse to pay the additional cost of the Premier edition when other solutions are available at much lower cost.  It's been fun Intuit, but so long!
28	-1	DO NOT PURCHASE-Tried 2 different downloads, 3 different systems, including a brand new system and this never did install, let alone me see it operate. I am a Microsoft system builder and I have never been more disappointed in the latest 2 consumer products as Office 2013 and Windows 8. Went back to Windows 7 and Office 2010 all is fine. I don't even try to sell my customers on any of this. If it isn't Windows 7 and Office 2010. I will not sell it to my customer nor will I build it for any customer. This is just sad. I lost my money on this as there is no refund on a download. I did not use it, I could not use it, it did not install. I am just simply out that money. My customers are glad that I do not handle my business affairs like this and also why I have repeat customers. I do not sell them S*** and I stand behind what I sell and offer a refund when something is not up to their expectation. I insure my customers are happy with their purchase so I do not have to give a refund. Wish I could have given it some sort of a positive rating, but I cannot. There is nothing I can say that is positive.
29	-1	Will not download on Mac and now I've wasted money.  I wish that there was a way Amazon would let me return this.
30	1	Since getting Avast I haven't had one problem, excellent product.....Blocks virus instantly,,,Would highly recommend to anyone...especially since I live on limited income,  what a blessing
31	0	HARD TO USE!!!
32	1	real good
33	0	I used H&R online version for 10 years.  This is first time used download version I like online version better than download version.
34	1	It secured my computer, woohoo!
35	-1	I bought my 2014 Turbo Tax at Costco but I don't think it would matter.  After using the Deluxe version for at least 10 years this year has been a disaster!  My Federal and State have been rejected twice, I've called their 1-800 # and waited and then the person I got couldn't tell me how to fix the problem that the e-mail said they could fix.  I had to leave town for a few days and when I got home I had a letter from the IRS stately my Identity has been compromised and after being married to my wife for 47 years I was now married to Mary Caprara.  I went into a contract with Turbo Tax that offered me a way to do my tax return and in return I would be offered a safe platform to enter my personal information WITHOUT my Identity being at risk because of poor, lax or possibly criminal neglect on the part of Turbo Tax.  So here I sit 3 weeks later not knowing what to do.  My IRS form 5071C offers me a website to Verify my identity but cannot do it, Their phone number1-800-830-5084 which is a special number to help people with an Identity theft issue tells you everyday to call back tomorrow or go to the website that doesn't work.  I have a refund of around 1,500 and I'm not sure if I'm even going to file this year.  If I do It might be the seed money I need to start a class action suit against TurboTax!  What you you think the odds are for me to use them next Year?  Probably better than seeing this in print on the &#34;Review List&#34;.
36	-1	In July I gave it 4 stars based on its features and power.  I'd been working with Adobe Premiere Elements 2, which did work, but which crashed so routinely that I learned to cut my work up into 2-minute segments before stitching together the late-stage work.  I switched to Cyberlink because I needed to work in HD.<br /><br />After working with it for a couple of months I have changed my opinion.  Perhaps I expected too much from a $75 product.  I'm working on a 22-minute video that's cut up into hundreds of clips, and probably few users will challenge it that much, but as I get toward project completion I get a lot of crashes, a lot of muffled audio that requires me to paste in new patches from the original audio, and quite a bit of scrambling and duplication within clips.  It's also very annoying when your audio goes mute in playback and you have to shut down and restart to make it play.<br /><br />Users should keep their Task Manager Performance Window up.  When you save your file, you may have 100% disk access for a minute and a half.<br /><br />If you are a newbie, this is a worthwhile learning vehicle, but I guess I needed a more stable program for my work.  Probably the product works for less ambitious work than mine, but I really can't recommend it because there is no credible upgrade path to professional software.<br /><br />Annoying features are that when I'm trying to drag in a second audio track for a cross-fade, it inevitably brings up a clip trim pop up window I then have to close to get back to my work.  Also, the(yellow zone) selection feature is very tiddly--we need to be able to do a preview render on a clip or on a group of clips without fighting the selector.  Lack of a scrub button on the clip previewer is annoying, and muted audio clips are not visually identified as such (by color coding) on the timeline--you have to right click to find out their muted status.<br /><br />I was initially very excited by this product, but after three months of working with it I'm hoping that Vegas or Premiere or Pinnacle will be an improvement.remiere or Pinnacle will be an improvement.
37	0	WHY on earth did you take away the sync function???  this would make perfect sense for my photo catalog!
38	0	I've been using quickbooks for 3 years now and so far love it. It's really helped me. But this update is pretty mediocre. First off, one of the main reasons I updated was the insights...but surprise!!! They're not available in quickbook companies what use more than one currency, which happens to be my case. Intuit should really focus more on letting the customer know every little detail before we make the purchase. Same thing happened with the online version, they sell you this amazing idea and say that everything works FLAWLESSLY and as soon as you open it up for the first time...oh sorry no double currency. Had to cancel my subscription right away. To pay 200 dollars and have this issue as soon as you open up the insights tab was a total let down. Only 3 stars for that reason. Why have double currency option if Quickbooks will not work properly if selected.
39	-1	Of all the things I bought in my life, this has to be the worst product. I had used Quicken for years on a PC. The Mac version is absolutely horrific. You are better off tracking expenses in Excel. Worst of all, my data file with over 10 years of transactions crashed.  I back it up every two months, so now I have pretty much lost every transaction in the last 2-3 months as I am not going to recreate manually. TRULY HORRIFIC!!!
40	-1	Terrible! Spent 1 hr trying to activate. No luck. Serial numbers simply didn't work!!!!!!!
41	0	Why do I need to continue updating a program that worked fine enough?  I use Quicken for clients and if they upgrade or switch, I am required to upgrade.  The product works fine but I'd like it to respond faster and provide more reports.
42	1	The trick of any anti virus product is meeting in the middle of the road between maximum protection on one side and maximum system performance on the other. Balancing between these two is a difficult task for any manufacturer, and AVG seems to be doing a fairish job after 18 months on the job here.<br /><br />I am running a small home network of between 6-8 systems at any given time, and AVG IS has been installed on 3 of them for the last  year and a half. The flexibility and ease of scheduling updates of AV definitions and scans during off peak hours appeals to me greatly so as to minimize the impact on network and system performance. This keeps the solution nearly transparent which is what is to be striven for with any AV product.<br /><br />Having a look at the log file at the junk that has been captured always brings a smile to my face as well.<br /><br />Being warned ahead of time by the link scanner of malicious websites is great for less experienced users, as it helps prevents drive-by script attacks from being launched in the first place.<br /><br />All in all, until I hear of something much easier to set and forget, I'll keep buying and installing it on new builds for some to come. Highly recommended.
43	0	I've been using PSE ever since it was introduced. Typically upgrading has been worthwhile every 2-3 versions, but this time I decided to step up from version 9 based on some of the new enhancement tools announced.<br /><br />First of all, PSE remains by far the best photo editor for anyone not wanting or needing the pro Photoshop software. For years I have had it loaded on two home desktops and one laptop. When I tried to install version 10 onto the third machine, I was unpleasantly surprised to find that Adobe has restricted the license to no more than two machines. That's just greedy.<br /><br />Anyhow, version 9 has remained on the third computer and now, after using both versions for several months, I have concluded that the upgrade was not worth it.<br /><br />So, five star product minus one star for a wimpy upgrade and another star for stingy licensing.
44	-1	Fraudulant Amazon/Norton rebate offer. Did not honor $20 rebate if ordered by July 28, 2015 on Norton Security. Shame on both companies for engaging in these marketing tactics.
45	-1	This software is for advanced individuals who probably have majored in accounting.  I am someone who purchased this software to help me track expenses for both personal and small business purposes as well as for budgeting.  I do an excel spreadsheet every year of all my bills, how much is owed and list out when they are due.  This software is not really user friendly.  It sort of reminds me of trying to read legal documents when your not a lawyer.  You have to read it over and over again.  I wish Quicken would provide a user manual with this product so one non-accounting major can figure it out.  I spent hours and hours the first day I downloaded it trying to enter all my data and import records from my bank, credit card companies, IRA etc accounts. It's so complicated in some areas.  Trying to tag and put the bank accounts in 5 main spending categories is a pain in addition to how they link with information to the various accounts is confusing.  I tried to access the software via he mobile set up and it does not upload any information at all.  So when I open it on my iPhone and iPad it shows nada.  I am very disappointed because I wanted a paid software rather than having to use something like Mint.com for free.  I don't want my personal financial info. to ever be exposed.  I will keep trying I figure this out because I have no other alternative!
46	-1	For an old timer, the new widely expanded variations and possibilities (formats, styles, etc.) just complicate my attempts to use Word and Excel as I have for 20 years.  Worst aspect for me...suddenly (I still don't know why ) my spread sheet containing carefully garnered details on more than 500 DVDs was just gone.  Nowhere on my computer.
47	-1	The product is very limited to usable browsers. It is not adaptable to android software, and the registration process is extremely painful. They keep you on the line by telling you they are waiting for approval of your product and spend the time hawking their other junk. The editing software is a throwback to the early 90s, and all the perks they use to sell the product require registration which is when they tell you that this software does not work well on the web. You need to buy the next version from them of course. Bait, switch and gouge is their methodology. Run as fast as you can.
48	-1	Best anti-virus is common sense.  That coupled with Microsoft Security Essentials (a free download from Microsoft) and the built-in Windows Firewall is all anyone really needs. If you're running Windows 8 then Microsoft Security Essentials is called Windows Defender and already installed. Third party anti-virus suites are no longer needed.  This isn't the 1990s.
49	-1	I expected to be able to do both efiles for free as it suggests. At the very end it forced me to pay $19.99 for the state efile. Also it was very difficult to get answers to questions. I was more able to get answers though the internet! But I'm done and glad of it....<br />Update: Noticed in very small print where it mentions you may be charged for your state
50	0	Was hoping this was a little bit more simply then it has shown to be.  I even got the book. Still can't do the things I was hoping to do.
51	0	Had a lot of problems getting this to properly download on my son's computer.
52	-1	Barely Usable<br />I have used quicken for many years.<br />I manage my budget very closely.  If I over-spend in one account I have to make that up from another account.  Accordingly, I have to adjust my budget amounts several times during the month.  At times I not only have to adjust my monthly plan I may have to adjust my annual plan.<br />When Intuit purchased Mint I tried it.  It was completely unusable for me.  The budget process was a disaster.<br />When I upgraded Quicken from 2011 to 2013 I was completely baffled by the budget changes.  It was unusable for me.  I had to revert back to 2011.<br />So now I have upgraded to 2014.  It has advanced from unusable(2013) to just barely usable(2014).<br />I don't know where to start.  For instance when I view my current budget report it lists as Actual Budget Difference.  When I simultaneously show my Planning Budget screen it shows as Budget Actual Balance. Very confusing when trying to match.  You have to display both because neither process tells you everything in one place.  It's just very frustrating.<br />Someone mentioned that the budget process got messed up about the time Intuit purchased Mint.  I agree with that.  I tried Mint again and it is still unusable for me.  I say get Mint's budget philosophy out of Quicken.
53	0	Update 08Apr2015:  a patch has been applied that appears to fix this issue.  with the patch installed, i am able to use my Steganos encrypted files without de-activating NS2015.  but, would not have known about the fix had i not been tracking it in the Norton forum.  Significant problem:  if you use file encryption and attempt to open an encrypted file with NS2015, it will result in a BSOD.  This problem surfaced on the Norton Support forums back in Dec 2014 and to date it has not been fixed.  As a work around, shutting down NS2015 while before opening an encrypted file and not re - initiating NS 2015 until the encrypted file is closed works for me.  I've been a Norton customer for more than 15 years and never had an issue with encrypted files.  Unless this gets remedied soon, my only choice is to  give up file encryption or give up Norton.  To further clarify, I am using Steganos software and it has previously co-existed with Norton (various products) for 15 years.  The problem manifests when I attempt to open a Steganos encrypted file while NS 2015 is active.  The result is the BSOD with reboot.  I do not know what happens if the product is used in the presence of full disk encryption or under other circumstances.  The encrypted file conflict was first reported in Norton Support Forums back in December 2014 (unfortunately I did not see that).  To see which other encryption products are affected (per user input, not anything official from Norton) please see the applicable Norton forum (search under Steganos or Truecrypt).  I'm posting this to help others make an informed decision about using this product.
54	0	Pretty buggy compared to my 2013 version, but was forced to upgrade to maintain web-linked accounts.
55	0	Its a 'ok' product that offers a lot value if you are after low-cost affordability for multiple licenses for MS Office Professional attributes.
56	1	I highly recommend toast I haven't I'm on my  mac
57	1	simple, easy and fast
58	1	seems to work but not as good as Avast
59	-1	Does not match with the online program. Same exact info was entered and two completely different outcomes. This program is useless and is not like the HR Block premium on website.
60	0	Okay, I have resisted using Quicken for years. I have worked with Excel to keep my personal and business finances, but after using TurboTax for several years I thought, why not get Quicken and just import everything? Well, I haven't spent that long with it, but it's not very intuit-ive (ha, ha, get it?) if you ask me. Naturally, when I get it to work, importing my data should be easier than what I have been doing. I have not heard of any other product that works like Quicken, nor one that imports directly into TurboTax.
61	-1	Unable to load the software... I keep getting error message &#34;Installation Failed, Please contact the software owner.&#34;
62	-1	I regret buying this product. First off let me tell you there support sucks and you will waist your time.<br />Second you will spend all day setting this up and to get frustrated because it does not match up with your actual accounts.<br />This product did not do anything that I read it would do. I own properties and use the older version of Rental Property Manger 2.0 and I find this product better than this one.<br />If you want to manage your finances don't waist your money use mint.com and set up your account there. This is a waist of money. Good thing I did not pay full price for this product.<br />As I mentioned in the beginning the customer support is horrible.<br />As for setup I had not issue installing and I was good to go to start up but once I had to input each of my accounts there was so many limitations that this product proved useless to provide me what I needed was manage my money.<br />Customer Service could not help and I want my money back.<br />Not a good tool to manage your finance and your rental properties.
63	-1	Totally different from my previous version and the &#34;help&#34; is no help at all.
64	1	Great product, for great price.
65	-1	Bought it for my new Macbook Pro with the hope that all Word and Excel files I have can be used immediately on my Macbook. The first problem is Thai language can not be displayed in Word.  The format changes when you open files created in PC. Interface and menu is different from PC version. I used a lot of mail merge features between Word and Excel files. When i opened those files in Mac, the links did not work. I think i need to buy a Windows 8 and a new copy of Office pc version to do my document. So this copy of Office is a waste of money becoz it is not returnable.
66	0	Most windows licenses - though not all - allow you to put one copy on a desk top computer and one copy on your laptop.  The license for this product has that specific wording.  Yet the license is limited to only three PC's-  period.  I have not yet decided if I will file a complaint with the state attourney general or not.  But, windows should not have used the license wording and then turn around and not allow three desktop and laptop combinations.  As for the program and the pricing - this is a great bargin.
67	1	"AfterShot Pro has a nice interface on the Mac version (no idea about Linux or Windows), and unlike other reviewers, I found it to be quite stable and fast with hundreds of images (but I have a beast of a Mac to run it on). Before this, most of my raw photo processing work was done in Adobe Camera Raw via Photoshop (CS6), and while I've tried LightRoom, it didn't \\""click\\"" for me - the controls were too scattered among the forced \\""workspaces!\\"" AfterShot Pro puts all the controls in the same place, with a few vertical tabs to move between them. This is a very efficient interface, and keeps the focus on the image. A few of the keyboard shortcuts seem like they are from the PC version (lots of F6, F8, etc.), which is not intuitive on a Mac, but otherwise everything is right where you'd expect.<br /><br />The quality of the raw processing and the images produced are excellent, even from my poor photography skills. Although there are lots of sliders and checkboxes, there are a few \\""auto\\"" tools that do a great job getting an image to 90%, leaving it up to you whether you want to go the last 10% by digging into the software further. The noise reduction and sharpening algorithms in ASP are better than the Adobe standard methods, which is good because there are precious few plugins for AfterShot to add these capabilities. In general, a very good piece of software for a budget price!"
68	1	H&R Block works well and provides piece of mind that you are not paying any extra to uncle sam. Have used it for past 9 years and have always found it reliable.
69	1	I have been using quickbooks pro for pc for around 5 years. It is good software, but they nickel and dime you for different products. Like for payroll, you have to pay extra if you want to use that feature. Well, in Quickbooks for Mac, you dont even have the option for payroll. Its a very watered down version of the quickbooks for pc. However, the basic functions of quickbooks for mac actually works perfect for me as I dont need the advanced options that most people do. I would highly recommend that you download a free 30 day trial of this software before you buy. If the trial works for you, then you can always buy the full version, but if it doesnt work for you, you do not loose any money.<br /><br />If you download the trial version and decide that you want to purchase the software, there is not a way to just simply add a product key to make the trial version the full version. They have you uninstall the trial and then install the full version with the product key. Why cant they make it easy and just let you add a product key to the trial? That would be to easy. Their customer service is not all that great either and if you need tech support, they charge extra for it.<br /><br />So lots of negative points here, but I rated it 4 stars because the software is actually great for what I need it for. I took off a point because they dont make it easy to upgrade from the trial to the paid software and also for making you buy new software every couple of years when you upgrade operating systems. If you upgrade operating systems every year, then you will be buying a new quickbooks software in about 2 years.
70	1	I have used a TurboTax product for the past 15 years to help prepare my tax return. The past few years I have used Home and Business. I have absolutely no accounting experience so I need help. TurboTax intuitively guides the user thru an interview of sorts divided into small sections. I have not used any other tax preparation software, so I can't compare. When a product meets your needs, why switch.<br /><br />Addendum<br />I just filed my taxes today. I downloaded the software from Amazon and received an $8 credit from Amazon. When I filed, I had the option to receive an Amazon gift card in the amount of 10% of my refund (in $100 increments). This brought the purchase price down considerably. Your mileage may vary.
71	1	Satisfactory.
72	1	WELL IT IS NOT MICROSOFT OFFICE 365. BUT IT WORKS WELL ENOUGH. SO IT DESERVE A 4 STAR RATING.
73	1	Always works great for me.
74	1	I purchased this item because the old version was not eligible for updates.  As always it is a good product but the constant purchase of new versions drives me crazy.  The do a good job with it and my accountant loves it.
75	1	i bought an Aiptec 3D camera, but the on board software was corrupted.  I bought Total Media Six, but it didn't work on Windows XP.  Movavi 3D Media player does the job so I can watch in 3D on XP.
76	0	My biggest beef is that I can't sort a report. In the PC version I could create a report and then sort it by columns. Not with the Mac version and that is a problem. Also I like the look of the PC version better. The Mac version seems as though it is missing stuff because the interface is so sparse compared to the PC. Nevertheless, I can still do most of what I could do on the PC and I love having it on my Mac.
77	0	works well for what I wanted..
78	0	This program is good if you are just starting out or just nee to do some book keeping. I handle accounting and inventory for 2 separate companies on has this program and the other has 2011 Peachtree complete accounting. If you are going to do a bunch on invoicing and has a decent customer base and inventory I would recommend the complete as it offers many more custom reports and makes tracking easier.
79	1	I would highly recommend this product because<br />1. It does what it promises, convert files, without any crashes or freezes in the process, works perfectly, in my experience that's rare for software in general<br />2. the quality of files that are made smaller is very good, you take 100's of MB of and still the quality is very good<br />3. it's easy to use, don't have to read instructions to use the basics<br />In general, these people know what they're doing and really deliver something good.
80	1	Very good OCR engine. Accurate and retains formatting.
81	0	Based on comparison to a professionally prepared return, Turbo Tax accurately calculated my taxes except for the foreign tax credit form (1116).  Entry of numbers in the 1116 form is largely left up to the user.  Calculation (such as of adjustment of qualified dividends (line 1a) and expenses definitely related to income resulting in foreign taxes (line 2)) is largely left to the user and a variety of manually entered adjustments.  Form 1116 is more complex than most others, but Intuit should be able to provide better assistance to the user.
82	-1	We e-filed 2014 federal taxes using TurboTax on April 13.  Then, we received a letter from IRS this week; it looks like someone stole our SSN and filed a fraudulent tax return for a refund.  When I contacted IRS, they didn't even have the real tax return we filed.  It turns out TurboTax transmitted the fraudulent one earlier on April 9 (I think they provide free 1040EZ returns), and that is the e-file confirmation we were receiving.  As to how this could happen, TurboTax could not answer.  So the software apparently does not alert the user if one tries to file another return using the same SSN. Now we have to file the paper return, and try to straighten out this mess.  It isn't TurboTax's fault that someone stole our identity, but I hold them responsible for dropping our tax return into cyberspace somewhere and not alerting us.
83	-1	Used Laplink PC Mover pro to transfer between an XP and a Windows 7 machine.  It transferred mostly files and few very standard programs, which I could have done myself in minimum time.  What it failed in miserably was transferring permissions.  I found I had no access to many files and programs.  I solved some of the problems myself  and continued, installing new software and old software it  failed to transfer.  But after three weeks when certain significant permissions problems persisted (like having no access to a printer port that was transferred by PC Mover) I called tech support.<br /><br />The tech I spoke with told me outright that they are very familiar with the problem and know how to fix it, so it is clearly a problem where their promise to transfer the setting fails, but they demanded an extra fee to fix this problem.  If I wanted to have a free solution,  all they will offer is to go back to the initial installation.<br /><br />Their famed &#34;free support&#34; is apparently only to 're-transfer' the transfer in which they initially failed.  If it fails to do what they claim it will do they call it 'post transfer' and demand money.  They apparently look at their failures as an opportunity to extort more money from unsuspecting clients.<br /><br />Miserable and as near fraudulent as a software company may get.  I will never touch any of their products.
84	-1	Lots of problems and defects. There is a feature to delete old unused accounts. I used this feature, and now when I do a validation, I get lots of errors regarding the deleted accounts.<br /><br />Also, too many bugs and inability to edit freely. I have used it for years, and now I need the planning feature, and tax features more than previously. I find I cannot do a calculation for next year unless I buy the new version. Ex.: Owning v2012, needing to do a projection for 2013 - cannot do it.<br /><br />This program is essential for me, but I do not like it.
85	-1	I was extremley dissappointed in the product and intuit this year. You have continually raised the price and disturbingly changed the forms within the program without clearly letting your loyal customers know. Your program continues to load slowly taking up valuable time. H&R Block's program appears to be as good, less expensive and faster. The course of action you have finally taken is good but comes too late. I believe I am only one of many customers who will be taking my business elsewhere next year.
86	1	a
87	1	love it
88	1	Have used for years but State is barely satisfactory.
89	-1	I downloaded the 2013 version through Amazon which gave me a free federal e-file (and lovely bonus on the gift card, thank you Amazon!) I was thus expecting to e-file my federal return for free, and pay $19.99 to e-file my state return. But yesterday when the federal refund hit my account, after subtracting the Amazon gift card I bought with the refund, and the charge for the state e-file, I'm $20. short of the money due to me. I emailed Turbo Tax and the processing bank for an explanation. The processing bank replied first, and said that they were directed to take fees out of my refund by Turbot Tax, so I had to take up my complaint with them.<br /><br />Turbo Tax replied by email next, saying that they had researched the issue and decided I'd purchased Audit Defense for $20. and provided me with a link that supposedly proved I had made an Audit Defense purchase. First, I didn't purchase Audit Defense, and second, the link Turbo Tax provided was for 2012 (and I didn't purchase it that year either).<br /><br />Next I called Turbo Tax where someone eventually picked up the phone and researched it. This time the person declared I was charged a &#34;processing fee&#34; of $20 but couldn't explain why that would have occurred. Such a charge wasn't disclosed at time of purchase or during the tax return preparation process. I asked him to research it further, and was put on hold for 29 minutes. After 29 minutes I hung up.  It's clear at this point that T.T. itself doesn't know why it overcharged me, and is just making up explanations.<br /><br />I'm posting my review hoping that someone who actually knows what's going on at T.T. will contact me to refund my $20.  I'm also posting this review so that if others are experiencing the same thing, they will know to complain.  I know T.T. got into trouble, along with the processing bank, in the past for this sort of thing.  I sincerely hope that doesn't happen again.
90	-1	Another disgusted customer. As a consultant and independent contractor, I have been using the Premier version of TurboTax for the past couple of years.  In previous years, Premier has allowed me to easily input all of my Schedule C income and expense items. This year, not so much. As other reviewers have noted, the Premier software functionality has been crippled and attempting to enter any Schedule C income requires an upgrade to Home & Business. Given all of the recent public outrage, Intuit agreed to allow Deluxe customers to upgrade for free.  Since Premier customers are similarly affected (this year's software won't do what last year's did), the upgrade from Premier to Home & Business is supposed to be free as well. (I confirmed the free upgrade with two separate Intuit customer service reps.) Apparently however, this is the world's best kept secret (even at Intuit - both Intuit customer service reps spent several minutes confirming the free upgrade). Here's the problem. Apparently, no one at Intuit knows how the free upgrade from Premier to Home & Business actually works. The reps that I spoke to told me they need a serial number from the Premier software (it was downloaded from Amazon), in order to give me a confirmation number that would tell the software that the upgrade was free (or possibly already paid for).  No one knows where this serial number is. I called Intuit Customer Service several times, spent over an hour on the phone with them to no avail. (&#34;Yes, the upgrade is free. No, I don't know how to give you the free upgrade.&#34;) I finally gave up, and when prompted by the software (when trying to enter Schedule C income), I put in my credit card information and bought the upgrade to Home & Business. Wow!  This will be its own chapter in the new business school text books, &#34;How to Screw Your Valuable Customers and Make Them Run to Your Competitors - The Intuit Debacle&#34;. Caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) indeed.
91	-1	This is the 3rd year in a row I uses Turbo Tax business for filing corp tax.  My experiences have been getting worse and worse each year.  Please understand the fact that we are either working as a owner of a small business or a comptroller for a mid-size company.  We don't need those stupid questionnaires/interview questions which would create errors at the end when overridden.  All we expect from the software is to categorize revenues and deductions based on the structure of a company, we will enter numbers accordingly. Importing from Quickbooks has never been right to begin with.  Those two softwares don't really talk to each other.  Making the software simple and skipping those stupid interview questions would be what I expect from the software next year, or else I would switch to other software.
92	1	This is a great program if you want to put together your tree.  The fact that I can sync to Ancestry makes it even better.
93	1	Use it every year.<br />Problems this year - but not with the program - just the distribution types.<br />Used it since 1980's.<br />Take that CTC's !
94	-1	Program locks up! Will Not Save! Equalizer is worthless!!! While program is open and you are attempting to edit an audio file it will simply close! Having just timed it, the program stays open for three minutes(+/-) and closes! I have reloaded four times....same results!<br />So, in a nutshell, I wasted $29.95! Try it before you buy it!<br />To me, it was a worthless download!!<br />Durell
95	-1	Quicken is sticking it to their customers by forcing them to upgrade to these supposedly great new features (Whoa -- a new cash flow graph!  Could't have lived without that.).    I respect their model of discontinuing service and support, as that is common in the software industry. But now they are de-featuring the products to force you to upgrade.  Example: You won't be able to download transactions from your bank or credit card company unless you upgrade.
96	1	I have used turbo Tax for the past 10 years,and love how easy it is to use.  It literally walks you through the entire process!
97	0	The Home module works great for our tax needs.  It works just like it has for the past dozen years.<br /><br />This was our first try with the Business module.  On a Windows 7 laptop, the check boxes and text never lined up correctly.  So we had to hunt and peck to fill in the questions.  They also do not have the state modules.  I would just say this module is a work in progress.
98	1	great
99	-1	...GONE!!!  Like many, I've been using TurboTax for as long as I can remember (20 years, give or take).  Now that they've decided to raise their price by 60% I'm using H&R Block's software for the first time (moving from the Deluxe version to a version that will properly do a Schedule C would have cost me 60% more).  Not sure what they expected, but if I raised my prices by that amount in my business I'd have no clients left...my hunch is that TurboTax has lost a slew of loyal customers.  They'll likely come to their senses for next year, but if I like H&R Block's product enough, I'll just stick with it.  The old saying is that it's much easier to keep your existing customers than to get new ones...good luck with that one Intuit.
100	-1	NCH makes really excellent software... but one program seems to 'require a plugin' which leads to another 'plugin' and it just goes on and on...
101	1	The Aavast anti-virus software that I use is great never a problem and keeps me safe online would recommend it
102	-1	THIS ONLY CAUSED MORE ISSUES. IT ULTIMATELY CAUSED THE COMPUTER TO BLUE SCREEN. WE HAD TO HIRE SOMEONE TO SOLVE THE ISSUES. HE DID NOT USE NORTON ONCE WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM SO WE ULTIMATELY WASTED OUR MONEY.
103	-1	"I upgraded from Quick 2011, so sorry I did.  This is the most unusuable Quicken that Intuit has developed.  I don't know who \\""master-minded\\"" this version but they must have never used this version of Quicken.  The budget:  Maybe I do it wrong, but at the end of a year some of my budget items are negative.  To carry this forward I would enter a negative number and carry on from there.  NOT IN THIS VERSION!!  Negative entries into the budget come out POSITIVE.  This threw my entire budget out, and I mean out.  I tried to get along with it, as I could not go back to Quicken 2011.  At the end of a month, you cannot correct anything in the past month(s) budget.  Maybe you under budgeted an item - SORRY, you can' go back and change it.<br />This is a real mess.  Although I had discs with 2010 and 2011 version upgrades, they would not load unless I had a prior full-bore version, not an upgrade.  I've made my own budgeting system with Excel, not as good as the old versions of Quicken, but there is no other place to go.  Micro Soft gave up with their MONEY - I wonder how Bill Gates does his Budget????"
104	0	Downloading from Microsoft is still painful compared to their competitors. You get harassed many times to put in strings of many numbers. They should be less paranoid and more customer friendly.
105	1	The Sony Movie Studio Suite comes with a great batch of tools for anybody wanting to get deep-in-the-guts creative with their home videos, photo slideshows and the like. The basic set of instruction videos are enough to get you off the ground running, making your own projects. The quality is really top notch (aside from an occasional bug where audio doesn't get compiled with the video, but that's probably because of my setup).<br /><br />  But when you hit the transitions and effects folders, theres almost no help. I haven't found a description for the tools, and I can only assume that you would need to have some professional editing background to understand what all these tools do. But theres a lot of them, and they're cool. I just wish I had better guidance on animating lens flares and the like.
106	-1	I've been using Quicken for a long time.  2014 does not run nearly as well as 2013.  About half the time on downloads it hangs up, I have to force an exit (ctrl-alt-del) from the program.  I'm running XP still so maybe no longer supported???
107	1	This is great software and is free....I also have had it on my Desktop for several year's..This is top notch Antivirus and will save you grief..
108	1	I have been using previous versions but this version allows you to do more. Definitely a buy for students! Activation was easy, just follow other reviewer's instruction on how to register your software.
109	0	I decided to try HRB because I was tired of the constant price increases from TT. The tax software program itself is fine. It asks questions a little differently than TT, but overall I didn't have any problems with it. Until...<br /><br />I ended up spending about 45 minutes actually doing my taxes. I then spent the next 3 HOURS trying to download the state and trying to reach a real person in customer service to help me! I somehow first ended up on a customer service chat. This person told me that HRB didn't download properly and that I needed to uninstall and reinstall the program. Chat timed out while I was trying to download the program again. Didn't fix it at all.<br />Did some more searching and found a phone number to customer service and after 21 minutes of waiting got a &#34;virtual customer service representative&#34; UUUGGGHHHH. Could not understand I didn't have TAX questions - I had technical issues. I had to just keep asking to talk to a person. I was so frustrated! When the &#34;virtual rep&#34; finally reached the end of it's preprogrammed responses, &#34;I'm sorry....did you mean......&#34; I was FINALLY connected to a REAL LIVE PERSON! It actually took this person about 2 minutes to fix my problem and they wondered why the &#34;Chat&#34; customer service rep didn't suggest checking and changing the proxy server before telling me to uninstall and reinstall the program.<br /><br />So basically as long as you don't have technical issues the program works fine. If you have technical issues it is not easy at all to get help.
110	0	This is not the best html software I've used, but gets the job done.  A bit of a learning curve to use it, but the price is dirt low for something that works!
111	-1	My experience with Microsoft Office Home & Business 2013 has been nothing but a nightmare from the moment I bought it for my new computer (Windows 7 OS).  I'd previously used Windows Vista, which was supposedly awful.  It was pretty bad, but how Microsoft could come up with something even worse boggles the mind!  It started with having to log onto Microsoft and create an account to download this abomination.  Both my IT person and I kept getting repeated error messages trying to enter the simple required information.  For whatever inexplicable reason, it finally worked after more than a couple dozen tries at various times of the day.  Since then, both Excel and Word &#34;have stopped working&#34; at least once on a daily basis (resulting in loss of newly input information). Outlook--for which I specifically bought the more expensive Home & Business version--is a total nightmare, i.e. unable to flag or move opened or previewed messages unless I go to another message and then come back to the one I was trying to flag/more--among other issues.  (My IT person tried to find a fix for this particular issue with Microsoft and determined this was &#34;normal&#34;!??)  What used to be a one-click action now requires 3 or 4 (even the basic act of opening an Excel or Word document).  Instead of enabling users to work more efficiently, Microsoft has managed to decrease efficiency and increase steps, work-arounds...and frustration...to unacceptable levels for business professionals such as me, who work from home, are under deadline and rely on their computers almost 24/7.  As my IT person advised, I should have switched to Apple when I had the chance.
112	0	We have used H&R Block's (Mac) software for several years to do kid taxes and it works reasonably well for the most part. However, this year somehow I was able to get to the print returns section without the software having properly saved the personal data so that the personal data page ended up being blank with a default of a married filing status. My wife edited the return and encountered the same issue. This would seem to me to be poor software design - one would think that the user would be alerted to a blank personal data section or prompted to save at critical junctures if the software is not autosaving your work. Saving frequently allowed us to complete the returns.
113	-1	I have yet to figure out how it works.  There is no manual.  There was an update for it also which I couldn't download.  Certainly not worth the money I paid for it.
114	0	I'm not a computer guru, but I'm not a computer idiot either.  I'm somewhere in the middle.  When it comes to buying software, I do admit things can get a little confusing for me and so I rely on my boyfriend's computer programming expertise to help me.  His input on this buy was minimal so it is possible that I chose the wrong package.  I will start with the negative and end on a positive.  My computer had the Windows Word Starter software on it.  All the documents that I created in the Starter program had issues once I upgraded to this.  I'm not sure if it was a computer issue or a software/program issue but once this was installed, the documents I had previously created in Starter had to be &#34;reconfigured&#34; into this one.  Every time I opened those documents for editing (I'm a writer) my computer kept automatically generating templates of the original Starter ones.  The documents would auto-open in this program but when I would go to exit out of them an additional file would try to be created and I would have to jump through hoops to get the &#34;Warning you have not saved this template...&#34; messages off my screen.  Eventually it became so annoying that I had my boyfriend look at it and he did something that only took fifteen minutes and it has since stopped...so, for all of you out there that can translate what I just explained, there ya go...that's the ONLY negative. :)<br />The positives are much more...has everything it says it does.  Downloading was a breeze.  Instructions were clearly marked and easy to understand.  The key number was easy to find (thanks to Amazon if you buy it directly from here and download it vs purchasing the actual disk).  The interface is very user-friendly without much in the way of change from the other Word programs (of course it looks VERY different from the earlier ones, but if you are use to the more recent layouts you will recognize things).  Lots of fonts to choose from.  Auto-save recovery (that may be a computer thing :)<br />One suggestion for the people selling this it to have a compare and contrast chart for those of use who would like to use the product but don't know the difference between them.  Also with that chart maybe have a &#34;recommended user list&#34;.  I know this says for Home and Student vs Business etc, but WHAT makes that different.  Are we talking a true corporation or just extra tools that I might find useful as a writer or home business owner???  If these already exist, then I apologize however I looked and couldn't seem to find them anywhere.  Overall a good product with some small tweaking, specifically on marketing and advertising.
115	1	Since installing avast! about 5 months ago I have not had a single instance of a virus causing mayhem. I have had numerous alerts from avast! and the problem is taken care of. The one problem with avast! is simply a delay in booting up, as avast! updates every time before my desktop opens. Other than that, I'm very satisfied.
116	-1	This is a rip off. I will never waste my dime on this software. It's very slow and the process of loading songs on deck is very ridiculous. Do not waste your money!!!

120	-1	I have used Print Shop for many, many, many years, and I have many projects that I have produced, saved, and tweaked over the years.  My family owns a small business, and I've done all our business cards, stationary, signs, post cards, etc.  Print Shop was a joy to work with, and I only infrequently had problems. Then, I bought a new computer with Windows 8.1, and I cannot use my &#34;old&#34; projects. I am so disgusted. Now I have to buy another computer with Widows 7 installed, so I can use Print Shop 23.1, again. I always recommended Print Shop to other people, but not anymore. What a disservice to all their loyal customers! UGH, UGH!
121	-1	"I have bought and successfully used Turbo basic for years.  Since I have no state tax here in FL, I'm too frugal (read cheap) to buy one of the versions that include the state tax part.  I can handle my small portfolio easiy on the BASIC version. I don't even mind, too much, all the embedded attempts to get me to upgrade. My beef with the download version was partially my fault.  I had something running on my laptop so I just downloaded to my other computer, thinking I could easily move it over later.  Whether it is a difference in operating systems, my lack of expert skills or Intuit's desire not to let you use the advertised 5 returns on two machines --- I have been unable to move in any of the three ways I tried. I've tried sharing the progam with wi-fi, moving it on a flash drive and using a backup facility.  No luck. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and didn't rate it \\""I hate it\\"" because it works ok -- just can't be moved. I'm guessing it can't be backed-up to protect against a hardware or software failure.  I wrote Intuit about this and after two weeks don't expect one."
122	-1	i purchases this app and tray to add the serial no but it didn't confirm im disappointed  bad app  i will purchases new version
123	0	I have mixed feelings about this forced upgrade.  I have been a Q user for many years and monitor my finances very closely using this product.  I have never had any problems up until this upgrade.  First, I hate being forced to do anything.  I supposed that is how they get you.  If you really enjoy a product and want to continue to enjoy it, you are forced to give them more money to keep it.  I know, waaaaaaah.  However, I did purchase the upgrade and then suffered several hours to get it to work right.  Be warned purchasers.  Be careful who you are talking to if you have to call customer support.  My first attempt at help ended me up in another country with someone who barely could speak english who tried to sell me another product at an additional $199 to fix the problem all the while trying to scare me to death saying I had this horrible virus that was going to wipe out my computer if I didn't do it.  Believe me I was a little more than irritated and can't put into print here the names I was calling him.  I finally reached someone on the online chat help that talked me through it all and I got it working.  Haha.  No charge.  Anyway, other than being forced to purchase the upgrade, I love the software.  Incidentally, I downloaded the mobile app today and it appears to be working fine.  Side note.  You have to have the 2013 upgrade in order for the mobile app to work.  Hmmmmm.
124	1	I am new to design software and was a little worried about the learning curved involved with this product. Yes, it does take some time to learn how to use. I found it easiest to work my way through a project and then go back and try a more complicated design after I had used it a few times. I really like how you can insert furniture, artwork, and even vehicles. It's really gives you a sense of how much space you have.
125	-1	Does not do what I want. I'm running Dazzle which is great software but no longer avaiable for windows 7. Still looking for a program that will do a equally good job. Till then I'm forced to keep my XP machine running.
126	1	RPG Maker VX Ace is definitely the best incarnation thus far of the RPG Maker series, and it is worth the extra money by far. Having used both VX and XP, I can say the Ace does everything they do and more.<br /><br />It is literally as powerful as you make it, your game-making tools are enough to make several fun, unique games without even having to delve into the deeper side of Ace which is scripting.<br /><br />Scripting is essentially coding, where you can alter the game to your own specifications, if you're willing to learn a programming language, Ruby.<br /><br />If you decide to go down a scripting route there is already hundreds of user-created scripts that creators have allowed for use, not all are free, but unless you're planning to sell your game 9 out of 10 scripters won't mind.<br /><br />The community is just amazing, RPG MAKER VX ACE may be simple to use, but that doesn't mean you can't get tangled when creating, or need to figure something out but you just can't. Whenever you do the community is there to help, it's an official site as well, run by the same company that releases the games over here, so all information is great and run by mods who are there for the love of RPG Maker.<br /><br />The community also does pack releases, where contributors will pool their resources monthly and release a free resource pack for the fans. Not only that, but several packs for your game that you pay for have been also released, a Sci-fi pack among them.<br /><br />In short if you want to get into making games and you don't have expensive technology at your fingertips, even if you just want a little fun, this is definitely worth your money.
127	0	I bought this package to help me design items to manufacture with my CNC router and 3D printer. I like it overall. Its a bit clumsy to use though. I upgraded it to the Pro version which added some additional features. It seems to do most of what I need/want it to do but is occasionally obtuse to figure out how. The documentation is VERY, VERY WEAK. Barely covers the subject. There is a little more help available on various forums, but not as much as would be nice.
128	1	I really like the Apple Numbers feature that allows you to have several &#34;worksheets&#34; within the same &#34;page&#34; so you can format a heading different than the body and trailer of a spreadsheet.
129	1	Every edition of avast! gets better and better. Most free software creates such a gulf between what the freeware and paid versions do that I often doubt the integrity and value of both the product and the company, which is not the case here.  avast's free antivirus is a robust tool that delivers powerful prevention and cleaning.  The nature of my work means I have access to paid versions of Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft, and a slew of other antivirus suites; avast! is what I use on my own machines. I think the nicest compliment I can give is simply -I have been so pleased with the freeware that I cheerfully upgraded to avast!paidware and have for several years to go. Great product.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Laurie-Ann<br />Heartsease Environmental Education
130	1	The Quicken product is excellent, but I have yet to discover the improvement of the 2014 version over previous versions.  Like previous versions it is user friendly.
131	0	Suggest that you experiment with the program a lot before depending on it to copy streams Quite confusing at times and instructions not the best. what I bought it for did not record properly but since then have had a few successes'.
132	1	The features are easy to understand and use.
133	-1	I came close to quitting TurboTax when you tried to swindle us with a bait and switch maneuver in trying to force us to buy the more expensive Turbo.  I had already purchased the Deluxe model like every year.  If you insist on charging more next year I will go to someone else!<br />How can we trust you with our returns if you pull these shenanigans on us.  This sounds more like something the  IRS would do.  I'm sure I am not alone in waiting to see if you change it back to the way it used to be.  If you don't, ADIOS!
134	1	After trying SiteSpinner, also purchased on Amazon.com, which I just hated, I decided to give this a try. Download feature direct from Amazon was a plus. Easy to use, has all the bells and whistles you need for a modern website. Very similar to Microsoft Publisher in its structure. Great price-point, should actually be a little more in my opinion. Software checks for updates at start-up. I built a rather large site in less than a month and have had nothing but rave reviews. Includes forms, social media share functions, picture galleries, practically everything you need for a professional commercial website.
135	0	Used quicken before - decades ago - this is more automatic and does some things automatically I would prefer it didn't.  Quicken is designed to be an automatic do-all product.  You just give it your accounts, and it will build your budgets, figure you accounts, polish your nails, and ... oops, maybe that last one is not correct.  All in all it is what it says it is.  I use it for a budget for a service club and that required a more manual approach.  I it gives me enough information that I can export its reports to excel and reformat them to what is needed.<br /><br />I use both Mac and PC, and the Mac version is sub-standard, so I have to use the PC version to do things like plan an annual budget, reporting.  &#34;You Need A  Budget&#34; (YNAB.com) is another option that would work as well, and works for Mac and PCs but their budget reporting was lacking for my specific needs.  So, back to the old standard is quicken and it is working for me.  I just put up with quirks of quicken.
136	-1	I needed a quick flowchart for my work and thought this program will do, it did not. Spare your money, don't buy it.
137	-1	Still trying to get it to install on my Windows 8.1 machine. Seems to be plenty of others out there having the same problem, but very little help coming from Intuit.
138	-1	This software doesn't work with my laptop and haven't had any luck getting my100 bucks back yet so much for a 30 day trail period
139	-1	Purchased this product for approximately 6 years and had audit failures, even with the product having the audit support and saying everything has passed!! The IRS found something to fail on almost every return.  I would rate this product very poor.  With all the screw ups the program done it made you coming out alot poorer!!  [...]
140	0	Does anyone know why this Quickbooks Pro 2013 is $75.00 cheaper here on Amazon than upgrading right from your own QB program on your computer?  That's a huge difference!
141	0	It is OK for a free antivirus
142	0	Good product, but lousy instructions.  &#34;QuickBooks Pro 2014, the missing manual&#34; is a necessity.  It's really poor of Intuit to not include this much detailed instructions.  Also my bank and credit card company, both major organizations, haven't gotten instructions from Intuit, on how to process the downloads from my accounts.  Here again, such a good product, but really poor support.  You would think, that a major product like QuickBooks and Quicken, would have better customer support, but their history on support is legendarily poor.
143	0	Ok, This is a great program for those who want to completely track all their financial movements. For those who just want to track their investment profits (Rate of Return) - an easier program to use is EASY ROR. This allows you to track gains/losses without the amount of entries to see how you're investments are doing, Hope this helps others. Marty
144	-1	This DVD creator did not work as well as I had hoped. There were many errors while creating the DVD. In the end I used a free program through Windows that was easier to use and never failed me during the burning process.
145	0	I have used Quicken for a very long time and have generally liked the way it worked.  It was fairly user friendly.  Quicken 2013 added a tab section in the check register.  I can't for the life of me figure out why it's there and all it is to me is an extra two keystrokes every time I make an entry.  It's a real pain in the butt.  I really wish that it could be disabled so the people who find a use for it can use it and those of us who don't want to can disable it.
146	0	i has problems with the installacion
147	0	works fine. must have it. thankz.
148	-1	Everything was okay when I used Turbo Tax last year, but not this year.<br />The transferred data,amount of return and refund last year, was incorrect.  It says the amount shown should be correct, if you didn't file amended return nor Tax department changed the amount.  NO! the numbers were not transferred correctly from my saved Turbo Tax file for previous year.  Looking at a hard copy of my previous return created by Turbo Tax, I wondered why the number changes when transferred??  Now I am not sure if I can trust this software.  Unreliable!<br /><br />Then I did Chat Help, that made me wait for 40 min.  Instead of trying to solve problem, Chat help person offered me to get free Turbo Tax 2011 after 20 min.  I kept telling her that I DO NOT need 2011 since I have already filed, yet she didn't seem to understand.<br /><br />Finally she asked me if I want free 2012 online version.  I asked her how many returns I could file online, she said 5.<br />I made sure if online allows us to file 5 returns, then she said one.  I purchased Download version for more than one return to file, but she said Online is only what they offer.  It took another 30 min+ to end the Chat Help.  Total 70 min+ on Chat Help.<br /><br />I called Amazon, it says there is no return/refund for this Turbo Tax Download, but there is 60 days refund at Intuit that the Chat help has never mentioned.<br /><br />TurboTax software purchased from Amazon.com or Staples.com<br /><br />Uninstall TurboTax from your computer, and then use one of the following methods to request your refund:<br /><br />  Email your electronic purchase receipt within 60 days of purchase to ereturns@intuit.com with a request for a full refund.<br />  Or, mail a written request, along with your name, contact info and a printed copy of your electronic purchase receipt, to:<br /><br />  Intuit Consumer Group Inc.<br />  Returns Department<br />  PO Box 386<br />  Duncan, SC 29334-0386<br /><br />Expect your refund within 2-3 weeks after submitting your request.<br /><br />They don't seem to refund since I don't get email from them about refund.<br /><br />I somehow managed to correct transferred numbers from previous filing that were incorrect and finished filing.<br /><br />[...]
149	1	Have used different versions for years. No problem's here.
150	-1	Can't install it and now I can't get a refund. I can't believe it. I've always used ESET NOD32 and now I paid for a product I can't even use. My computer is running windows 8.1 but I can't access safe mode to try uninstalling. I don't know whats going on but this is BS and I want my money back.
151	-1	I have used Quicken since 1995 and have been happy with it.  Since I have updated to 2013, I can't download my Wells Fargo accounts and when I tried to print a tax summary the program shuts down and nothing is printed.
152	-1	I visited this website today (January 2) expecting to buy TurboTax Deluxe as I have for many years past. I'm shocked to find out that this product no longer suits my needs.<br /><br />Many years ago, H&R Block dropped support for the Mac, so I switched to TurboTax (then called MacInTax?), and have been a satisfied customer ever since. My next step is to visit the H&R Block website and see what they offer for tax preparation software - the 2014 tax year may be the year that I switch back.
153	-1	If I could AVG zero stars as a rating, I definately would. Nearly one year ago, I purchased their Internet Security 2013, partially because Consumer Reports gave it a decent rating and partially because I wanted to try a new Internet security system.<br />Despite the fact they, &#34;Guarantee your satisfaction or your money back,&#34; those are nothing more than words on paper to these people. The AVG product I purchased was defective and did not run on my computer, so I called their customer service line to ask for a full refund of $50. After long wait times and nurmerous reassurances from their customer service supervisors that I would receive a check in the mail....well, it's 2014 and still I have not seen a dime.<br />Once you give these people your hard earned money, it's gone forever. It is my hope that by writing this review, I can save someone from going through the same lousy experience. Do yourself a favor and stick with Norton Anti-virus or another software company, avoid AVG like the plague.
154	0	I like a lot of the aspects of Quickbooks online. Unfortunately, there is no guide to really help you through the tough issues. I have spent many hours trying to figure out certain aspects of the program. If there was more readily accessible information on the program it would really improve the user experience.
155	1	I have been using TurboTax for many years.  I have found it to be very convenient and easy to use.  It is especially nice how it finds and downloads so much data from the previous year to save a lot of input.
156	0	Product was doing OK until release 9 that was pushed out a couple of days ago. Now I have thousands of duplicate entries in old account.<br />Wonderful way to spend a Friday morning - figuring out how to zero out or delete the dupes.<br /><br />On the bright side, the calendar isn't causing the app to crash like Quicken 2010 did.
157	-1	I have been using Quicken since the 1990's and this is clearly the worst upgrade to date.  Since updating I have not been able to use the program because it crashes anytime I try to use the program.  I have tried updates, FAQ's uninstalling and reinstall and nothing seems to help.  I sure wish I would have read the reviews beforehand and saved myself time and money.  I have requested a refund and have yet to have a response from Quicken.
158	0	I have used Turbo Tax for quite a few years and have always been completely satisfied with the results.  However, this year I was less then pleased. The Federal return it did fine.  I moved last year so had to file in two states.  The first state it did completely wrong.  It's the state I have lived in for over 20 years therefore had plenty of background from previous years.  Luckily I reviewed the filing before submitting it and corrected the mistake.  Interestingly, even when I corrected the mistake, Turbo Tax  didn't raise a fuss.  Apparently it liked the return the wrong as well as the correct way.  I purchased the second state from Turbo Tax for $40, only then did it tell me that it couldn't totally complete my return for that state.  I would need to go onto the state website and download some additional forms to complete, then file manually.  Frankly, if I had known I'd need to do all that leg work I would have saved my $40 and done the entire state return myself.<br />Not sure what's up with the software this year, but it needs an overhaul.
159	0	"I had more difficulty starting 2014 than any in the past 10 years or so. In trying to register it my Quicken/Intuit username/password were not recognized. After about a half hour of chat with Quicken, we found that the cd I bought directly from Quicken was Release R 1. When I downloaded their \\""Mondo\\"" release R 3, I could register. However this was after I had changed my user name and passwords three times. All in all it took about 3 hours of my time to install 2014.<br /><br />Quicken 2014 was faulty because it did not request an update when installed. Intuit's TurboTax won't let you even open without asking. Most of the programs I install... MS Windows, Office, etc. all update upon installation. Perhaps Quicken 2014 was outsourced to the Canadians."
160	-1	I tried to e-mail customer service to get a new registration code after I lost my code from the downloaded version. I registered for an account and then followed the instructions to enter my account.  It took me 30 minutes to find where they had an e-mail contact.  They actually went to extremes to hide the contact information.  I urge you  DO NOT BUY THIS! Any company that does not prominently display how to contact them on their website is to be avoided.  I have been a customer for ten years and will never, ever buy another Punch product even if I have to draw floor plans by hand in the dark.
161	1	been using it for years. works every year. I'm always tempted to use another vendor, but I continue to buy from Intuit as a convenience. Not sure it's the best, but it works well.
162	-1	I was also a loyal TurboTax customer for years...not anymore.  Their removal of schedules in the deluxe program and then trying to charge you the premium fee for access to them was the last straw.  I'll be using H&R Block's much cheaper program from this point forward (which allows you to import your TurboTax info from prior years, so no worries there). Heck, H&R Block's premium program is cheaper than TurboTax's &#34;Deluxe&#34; mid-range one, so it makes even more sense to switch.<br /><br />TurboTax is going to lose a lot of customers over this price gouging, and they deserve to.
163	-1	This is an indictment of Amazon's customer service, not Adobe's product. I subscribed because there was a special offer of $25 credit attached. I was supposed to get it by 4/7. Time goes by and nothing happens. I call on 4/16 and multiple times the following days, only to get transferred to various departments, ending up at Software Download. They kept saying we'll submit your issue to Marketing since they handle this. 2 TIMES I called and they submitted and nothing ever happens. Today, 4/24, I called again, and they finally realize it is about a S-U-B-S-C-R-I-P-T-I-O-N!!!!! I'VE BEEN REPEATING SUBSCRIPTION AND THEY WERE ALL THINKING PRODUCT, PRODUCT, PRODUCT!!!!!! I'm not trying to be insulting here, but the drones at Amazon customer service have ZERO IQ!!! Some smarts, yes, but no intelligence. They literally cannot think outside the box, or script. General products? Perfect. Subscriptions? It's like they've never heard of such a thing!! When someone says Adobe subscription, most people would understand software subscription. Not these people. They literally do not know their own product!! Idiots is an appropriate description. DO NOT EVER BUY A SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION HERE. THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU!!! YOU WILL WASTE MUCH TIME AND MENTAL ENERGY!!! For me, I will begin shifting my purchases to eBay or elsewhere. I think there has been other complaints about Amazon service related to software subscriptions. Too bad Amazon, YOU BLEW IT.
164	-1	Because of the size of my hard drive, only 150 GB, I sought to download Adobe Photoshop to my external hard drive (500 GB) to save space. What it brought instead was an apparent virus that clogged up my internal memory by attaching to my scvhost.exe file, preventing any applications from running. Two weeks later, the machine is virus free but at the cost of removing the Photoshop download for which I believe Amazon now owes me a refund.
165	-1	1/2 the function all the price
166	1	best antivirus out there<br />recommend to every one<br />i use on my PC and cell<br />lost cell works great<br />browser cleaner great
167	1	This is GREAT.
168	0	Might be better if my memory was better as by the time I need the info I can get it quicker off the internet.
169	-1	DO NOT BUY THIS IS A SCAM. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.<br />I purchased product and it bricked my computer. Then Avast offers to &#34;fix&#34; the problem for a payment. They don't refund money or provide customer support.
170	1	McAfee was downloaded on my computer before and it worked great I needed this because my subscription had expired so I needed this one, so far so good
171	0	Works as expected.
172	-1	Not very helpful.  I thought all was well, but now have been audited for my failure to enter (or be prompted to enter) my non-imputed income from my 401K contribution which I was not aware was to be included in my &#34;Income&#34;.  Not really &#34;income&#34; for me, but hopefully will be in the future.<br />This was not explained in the H&R block software.  It resulted in my needing to do an amended form for 2011 because it affected specifically my Property Tax results.  Just wish H&R would have caught this and would have made it clear to include this information.  I guess from now on I will have a tax consultant assist me for the &#34;hidden things&#34; I didn't know about.
173	-1	Bought this product ... never worked.. and I and I currently have no option to return the product... total rip off...
174	-1	worked fine for a few days, then out of the blue it would only open the window to &#34;create a safe&#34;. i could not open the safe. i contacted the company<br />only to be told there isn't anything thay could do on there end... the option thay suggested was to download a new safe, free of charge and then<br />export what was in the old safe, to the new safe. Wouldn't be much of a safe if that could be done...<br />i have a new safe, but i have nothing in it, i don't trust it yet, everything i had in the old safe,very important doc.etc are gone forever. think about it<br />before you buy it and use it, it just might be TO SAFE.
175	1	Purchased PC Matic a few weeks ago and real easy to download the program and seems to be running very well takes time to run the hole check-up and slows down the computer a little but real satisfied I would recommend this to all my friends.
176	-1	I find the new budget area to be very user un-friendly. I wish they at least offered the option to keep it as it was. If I could I would go back to the older version. I have not found anything that is an improvement from the older version I had. I have found much I don't like and can't use any longer. I plan to look for a different financial managing system.
177	1	I have been using Avast Free for several years and it works great.If you don't have an antivirus program, you should get this one.
178	1	Good price and one of the best antivirus for any windows system. Also, this product was a digital download for a quick installation.
179	0	It appears to be working.  I bought it to monitor my portfolio.<br />I will say that it does not know how to handle a Stock Split greater than 2 for 1.  I has a 3 for 1 split and ended up with 900 shares instead of 300.
180	1	Very happy
181	1	I've been using avast Free Antivirus for several years now.  It is reliable and has caught quite a few viruses before they infected me.  I find that avast does not constantly nag me and it doesn't interfere with my computer's performance, which is important since I use an old Windows XP laptop, and because I do a lot of Power User stuff that used to trip up the competing brands.  I've installed avast on every computer in my home, and recommend it to friends and family.
182	0	Beware! The mac version of this software DOES NOT work with &#34;OS X 10.10 Yosemite&#34; and is stated to only works on &#34;Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Mac OS X 10.7 Lion&#34;. This fact is not clearly stated until after you purchase it and refunds are not allowed! Yikes!
183	0	TurboTax is a great product. It's easy to use and very thorough. On its own, I'd give it five stars. I give three to this deal because it was a little misleading. The description said a state download was included, which it was. However, a state download does not include e-filing, which was another $19.99. All in all, it's still an okay deal (and cheaper than purchasing directly through TurboTax's website), but the description was misleading. Hence, three stars overall.
184	-1	I'm an IT Pro, and I have this on three Windows PCs, including 2 Win7 PCs, and an 11 month old Dell XPS27 with plenty of horsepower running Win8.1.  All three machines have experienced significant and unresolved performance problems.  The email antivirus makes both Outlook 2013 and Outlook 2010 completely unusable, and the real-time scanning engine causes the entire machine to lag up to 30 seconds at a time.  Kaspersky's support docs regarding performance-tuning their product have been completely ineffective after a month of trying.  This product is a total waste of money; wish I could return it - don't buy it.  Update to my post: Thanks to Amazon for making a one-time exception to allow for a refund. Much appreciated.
185	-1	I cancelled as soon as possible and I was sad because I love photoshop. I couldn't even create a simple text box or type a letter without this digital download glitching. And no, it's not my computer or operating system. I tried restarting, reinstalling, every tech help possible. Great idea, I would love to try this again if the bugs get worked out.
186	-1	Some things are require by your employer for work.  This is one.  What can I say, anything that Microsoft has created from the year 2010 to today is sub-standard at best.
187	0	Not as simple as Turbotax, but works.  I couldn't get the deductions to work well nor does it provide proper direction on deductions or counting losses on property.
188	1	While I will not write a step by step review, I would recommend quicken 2015 for new users and upgrades.  There has been many reviews with positive and negative overtones.  My review is positive.  Installation was easy, (always back up your data before installing), and usage has been what I expected.  Only issue so far was my old reports did not update, but that wasn't a big problem, 5 minutes and that was taken care of.  Haven't tried the credit report yet, so can't report on that.  I would buy it again.  Should we expect perfection when we buy something, I do, but I understand anything new or upgraded will have some issues that need to be worked out.  If I run into problems later I will update this review.  Since I couldn't give it 4 1/2 stars for the little problem, I went ahead with the 5 stars.
189	-1	Not impressed, needs the tax deduction list
190	1	I have used turbo tax for the past few years.  It is so simple to use and always finds me money.  This year it walked me through an amendment for my 2011 taxes.
191	1	Did what was expected, as expected, and less expensively than TurboTax. Will consider again next year at &#34;tax time&#34;
192	-1	Terrible software! Way too many glitches, data from previous version of Quicken did not convert very well, and it is VERY SLOW! Safe yourself the money and pain and don't upgrade to Quicken 2015!
193	-1	Used TurboTax for years, will see how H&R block goes.  It would cost me more to upgrade to file my dividends than the dividends I will receive.
194	-1	The product page specifies that this software is compatible with Windows 7. It's not. When you download the software you find out that it's limited to use with XP and Vista only. Do not purchase this product if you have W7, or you'll have to spend an hour working through the customer service process for a refund. UPDATE: It appears that Amazon has now corrected the product description. However, there is another product page showing a similar product that has the same problems. Amazon is usually very good at product descriptions. This is further proof of caveat emptor. The price looked so good I wondered how it could be so cheap. I learned from this experience.
195	-1	I want my money back or a version that works on my computer. I'm surprised that the download software didn't check my system.
196	1	was a Norton user and switch because of viruses seeping into my system.  Switch to Avast, never a problem...love it.
197	1	Several times over the past few months, Malwarebytes has alerted me to either potentially dangerous sites, or potentially dangerous files. After some investigation, it appears Malwarebytes was correct. I verified a total of 4 sites at anti virus makers, and generally all or a large majority concurred with Malwarebytes assessment. The difference is it wasn't AVG or Superantispyware that stopped my PC and reported the danger, it was Malwarebytes.<br /><br />I purchased a number of lifetime subscriptions when they were recently on sale for $14.99, one for each PC and laptop in my home. I'd not suggest an annual subscription, or a non-premium, as they have limitations on protection. I've seen the price very from $15 to $35 at different places, if you happen to see this on sale, and would like an additional layer of protection for a Windows based PC, it may be a decent investment.
198	1	I been using it for a while an havent had an issue. I am using it even when iam entitled to a free mcafee thru my cable company
199	-1	I have never owned quicken but figured despite the poor reviews that it had to be OK.  WRONG.  The product downloads immediately and then an error comes up about system requirements.  When you click through the error to the Quicken website, Quicken identifies the bug.  Amazon should not sell defective products.  Also note - Amazon's return policy does not allow for refunds on software so buyer beware!<br /><br />Ps. this is my first ever review because this is so ludicrous.
200	1	I highly recommend it very reliable
201	0	For many users the installation freezes/hangs in Windows 8.1. There is no CPU usage seen in Task Manager at all no matter how long you let the installer run. Leave it be and go to this web site http://quicken.intuit.com/support/help/patching/quicken-2015-for-windows-release-notes--updates--and-mondo-patch/GEN86565.html. Download/Run the Mondo patch and reboot when it completes running. You should be able to then start up Quicken 2015 and convert your data. Sadly Quicken continues to have abysmal programming and support (Intuit makes Adobe seem consumer friendly) but Quicken is the only program that can do whatever it does and if you have decades of financial data in Quicken, as many of us do, Intuit knows it has you by the short and curlies. Once it opens Quicken 2015 works as well/horribly as its predecessors with an interface essentially unchanged from 2014. If it tells you that your data was created using Quicken Home and Office, as it did me but I have never used that program, ignore the offer to &#34;upgrade.&#34; If you are a seasoned Quicken user you are inured to the ugly incompetence of Intuit programming. DO NOT FAIL TO BACK UP YOUR DATA PRIOR TO UPGRADING TO QUICKEN 2015 AND MAKE SURE YOU CAN REINSTALL YOUR PREVIOUS VERSION OF QUICKEN IN CASE OF DISASTER.
202	1	Good, thanks!
203	0	I have had Norton 360 on all my computers for a few years now and have always felt safe and secure.The other night the computer was acting WEIRD so i ran some scans but Norton picked up nothing.I then ran Malewarebytes Anti malware and it picked a TROJAN>AGENT infection.It said restart  to remove but it was still there.I called norton premium support for $89 and they worked on my computer for about 8 hours over the course of a couple of days.They claimed virus was gone but the computer was still acting strange.They also REMOVED my malewarebytes program claiming a conflict between the two programs.I reloaded it and scanned and sure enough the virus was still there but this time it removed it but the damage was already done to the registry and i had to wipe everything clean cause system restore would not work.They speak very bad English and i think i wasted my money on the premium support{they are located in India].I will continue to use the Norton software because i still think it is one of the most highly rated  programs in the computer magazines..GOOD LUCK...
204	1	Did just what I wanted it to do.  State retrieval was easy as was the loading of info from previous years.
205	0	2014 Tax Planner Errors identified<br /><br />1. LTCG are taxed at 5% for 10% & 15% income brackets instead of 0%<br /><br />2. AMT uses $150K for AMTI exemption phase-out instead of $156.5K (2014 value). The AMT exemption phase-out should be a tax table value updated each year with income brackets because it is also indexed for inflation.<br /><br />3. AMT LTCG taxed at 10% up to the phase-out value and 20% above phase-out value instead of 0% for balance of regular TI remaining in 10% and 15% brackets  and 15% thereafter.<br /><br />4. LTCG is correctly included in AMTI and the phase-out amount is applied to the regular AMT income tax calculation. If the phase-out value is corrected no change is needed.<br /><br />5. If using the scenarios feature in Tax Planner, be aware a previous year's tax rates are being used even when selecting the current year. You will also notice the Years columns are incorrect in the table. This appears to be more than just a typo and is an indicator the wrong year's rates are being pulled from a hidden table.<br /><br />6. Kevin O pointed out in Quicken Community post other shortcomings in more complicated aspects of capital gains which I would be willing to give Quicken a pass on if they could get the simple stuff sorted out. QDI is one aspect that I agree with Quicken should be left to the user to reclassify by transaction if so desired.<br /><br />7. Scheduled State tax quarterly estimated payments made in the following year are included in this year's tax planner deduction. Q1 (last payment due) scheduled estimated payments made in following year should not be included in the current year estimated state tax deduction. They are handled separately in a last year's taxes paid this year input box.<br /><br />8. Tax Planner is a valuable tool and the primary reason I update software each year. Correcting the calculations in the code would not take more than an hour so I don't understand why they still persist in Release 6.<br /><br />9.Until then, I will continue to enter a tax credit manually to account for the overestimation of taxes owed.
206	0	We have 3 users and a server which were updated to 2014. It was not as easy as it should be. The admin password had to be reset several times. The last of which required a 1 hour call to tech support. If you're going to force us to upgrade every 3 years, at least make it a simpler transparent process.
207	0	I obviously bought this to learn QuickBooks, with which I had NO experience. The video is comprehensive and, if you can pay attention from beginning to end, you can probably turn around a teach someone else how to set up and run QuickBooks.<br /><br />I just wanted a basic understanding to get me started. I found after trial and error that using my laptop to &#34;play&#34; the video while I worked on my desktop was the best way for me to get any value out of the video rather than clicking back and forth between windows.<br /><br />Overall, I found the video a little boring and tedious, and I lost interest. My accountant showed me the basics of QuickBooks in ten minutes on my laptop in her office. For me, it turns out that sitting down with my accountant was a far better learning strategy for me. I doubt if I will refer to this product in the future...
208	-1	Bad download, this version does not work well with firefox. Its hard to start up budget process without manual. Error messages, income expense reminders keep popping up, annoying pop up messsages to upgrade a few times in the session. If i wanted to upgrade, i would have brought those versions as needed. This has been a big waste.
209	0	Since I downloaded this version, I have had some problems navigating it and am disappointed with the accounts/investments section. There is no tutorial and I am left with words like &#34;edit&#34; and I can't seem to complete.  Why is it that new programs don't come with a manual and we are so often expected to figure them out for ourselves?
210	0	It works!  win vista and before had a similar program as part of the package I fault Microsoft for leaving it out of Windows 8.1  I seldom watch movies or tv,  I tend to fall asleep If I am not engaged in the program, sometimes even then.  but have enjoyed shows from my youth with this.  e.g. Ma & Pa Kettle...
211	1	I have used Quicken for years on my mac....owned many different versions.  I upgraded to Quick Books as I thought my reports would be more professional for my non profit's financial reports.<br /><br />I have given up using QB, never having achieved any level of success using it.  And bought the new Quicken, and am living happily ever after.
212	-1	They need to stop fraudulently advertising that this product works with XP ...IT DOES NOT. I want my 20 bucks back !!
213	0	Seems a bit clumsy to use, periodically I get suspicious pop ups that I ignore and eventually go away, but my machine is clear off bugs and that is what I wanted.
214	1	Since I've been retired I haven't had a real need for a high end word processing and spreadsheet software worth paying the high price for the most popular software.  You can't go wrong with this and it can save to the cloud drive if you want.  I was concerned that it saves the document in a ods file, but found out you can save it to any format even xls.  It maybe a new program but it does fit my needs.  I have a need for a word processor and a spreadsheet program, but without of all the extras in the popular software. It can do allot and they are expanding it more.  You can find almost any type of template you need.  Some components are a little different than MS like entering formula etc, but thats a small learning curve.  Was happy I found this software as a free download
215	1	people say the anti virus companies make the viruses to sell their products.if that's true then why is an excellent anti-virus like avast given for free.great stuff.
216	-1	This program handles day-to-day credit and banking transactions quite well - as long as you don't download your transactions.  Downloading transactions changes the transaction description.  I have also found that tracking investments and loans is a real pain in the neck.  How I long for the days of Microsoft Money...
217	0	If you want to create slideshows to put on a dvd to watch on a computer or TV then this program is okay.  But if you want to create slideshows that you can upload to sites like youtube or FaceBook, then forget it.  If there's a way to accomplish this, it's not given in the help files (which are a bit sparse on information). Another big drawback is that you can't custom time each slide (like you can on dvd photo slideshow professional).  But that program is over 3 times the cost of this one.  So I guess you get what you pay for.  I just wish I hadn't spent the entire afternoon creating a slideshow that I can't upload and share with anyone.
218	1	A lot of reviews of this app compare it to the bloatware that runs on windows.  That app does everything but balance the federal budget, and if you really have enough time on your hands to leverage even half the features it has, well then good for you!  I've used the windows version for many years and rarely found it worth the $70 yearly upgrade fee.  It's got too many features to make any of them really intuitive and I still get bogged down looking for some of them even after all this time.  The mac version is concise, and does almost everything i need in a much simpler interface.  As a product person by trade, I can really appreciate what they did to make the aesthetics and flow simpler and more productive.  Things happen the way I thought they would on first use.  The layout is much better and the most commonly used features are right in front of me.  I also seem to zip right through my daily/weekly cycles to bring in transactions, categorize them, and then search/report.  I can appreciate that it's not for everyone, but i frankly don't have time to exploit even a fraction of what's in the windows version.  And for the price I paid, I'm thrilled with this app!
219	1	Great integration with the iPhone app and the desktop program. It's nice to be able to input entries while out and about.
220	-1	I purchased AOL Computer Checkup on 12th July 2014.  At first it was okay but, for the past three months or so, it stalls out at registry cleaner 15% and, since I can't get any answer at all on why or how to fix it, I will not be renewing.  It stalls and goes no further even if I leave it open all night.  No point in owning what I can't use.
221	-1	I just spent another 3 hours fixing a connection problem to my bank accounts.  I have never had such a bad experience with Quicken software which I have been using since 1994.  I would give anything to go back to Quicken 2012.  It was stable and reliable.  Unfortunately, Intuit decided to no longer let the old version communicate  with my financial institutions.  I have literally, spent 10's of hours since January fixing connections to my accounts.  It seems that every few weeks or so, what was reliably working stops.  Several time the only way to fix it was to spend an hour or more with Quicken support via the web ( not the phone) to get a very convoluted fix.  I wish I could charge Intuit my usual consulting fee as a software consultant for all of the time I have spent undoing and redoing one step update with my accounts.  This version should never have been released!
222	0	The protection Kaspersky provides is amazing. Unfortunately it's a huge cpu hog on a couple of my systems. While researching the issue via google it appears there have been issues reported like mine for a few years now. After trying several installs/uninstalls I've given up and switched to another product. If they can get that sorted I'd switch back, but I don't want my machines melting down in the meantime.
223	1	Nice
224	0	"The graphics are spectacular.  It's a great product if you want to generate 3D images to help visualize different interior and exterior decorating schemes on a generic box, but the company offers less expensive programs to do that.  I suspect those programs are bundled as component parts of this more comprehensive product so they probably do that kind of stuff well and for less money.  At this price level, the product is touted as an easy to use tool for someone attempting to design a house.  It simply isn't.  The main problem is that the program \\""auto-generates\\"" all roof planes.  It does not allow the user to edit those planes in any intuitive way.  The company offers on-line manuals, on line training videos and access to a users' forum but I haven't found it to be very helpful.  I could have completed several collegiate level technical drawing courses in less time and with less effort than I've invested trying to master this program and I've yet to make it work.  I have devised ways around the program's limitations but employing them requires a greater investment of time and effort than is spent on structural design which pretty much defeats the whole purpose of computer \\""aided\\"" drawing.  I wouldn't recommend this product.  It is frustrating.  The foregoing review, edited to remove some of the harsher comments, prompted the publisher to both post a response and write me directly.  Both responses offered assistance.  I've taken them up on it.  On the plus side, I received a sketch this evening that closely resembles the multilevel roof I spent an entire weekend attempting to achieve.  I've edited this review to boost the rating from one star to three because of the company's effort.  Chief Architect obviously wants satisfied customers and they have made a genuine and genuinely appreciated effort to satisfy me.  In the process, they've demonstrated that the program is more capable than my experience led me to believe.  On the other hand, the publisher's technical support staff has been evolving the \\""almost but not quite right\\"" drawing over a period of three days that involved exchanging plan files, pencil drawings and descriptive comments.  The comments informed me of various requirements that are not well explained in the manual.  Relatively simple roof lines auto generate acceptably but complex and multi-level roofs are not easy to produce.  The process is not intuitive and the learning curve is steep.  I still don't recommend the program for people who are inexperienced with computer aided design software."
225	1	Typing Instructor (Typer Island) is really fun, and I look forward to doing a lesson. I like that once you get to the castle, you get to unlock the lost city.  We had previously purchased on-line access.  I got to the level right before the castle, and then our computer broke down.  We had to get a new computer.  We had to buy new typing instructor software, so I had to start from the beginning.  That was disappointing.  But other than that, I love it.  I have learned the home row and which fingers to use to type most letters.  I really recommend this product.
226	-1	This program worked better 10 years ago.  Silly me I thought since our Quicken was a 2008 I would upgrade.  So I did.  I was hoping to get the automatic download from our bank to work again.  This feature stopped working a couple of years ago and we have just used Quicken as an electronic check register.  So I installed and fiddled around to get our bank to auto download to Quicken.  The initial problem was that it downloaded all our accounts from this bank and set up all of them as individual accounts.  I only wanted to use the one.  I never could get my brokerage account to auto download.  Then I changed bank passwords.  Auto download with our bank stopped.  I had to go to the internet to find a fix.  That consisted of disabling the auto download feature and then starting it over again.  This made a huge mess of our account.  I did figure out how to disable all the other accounts I don't want to download automatically.<br /><br />Bottom line.  I am able to get the program to work on the one account and auto download.  But I very likely could have been able to get the old program to do that too.  I tried setting up things like assets and stock holdings and just gave up after hours of trying.  I do not know if there is an alternative to this program, but before I upgrade this again I am going to check that out.
227	-1	"I downloaded Quickbooks Pro 2012 Mac<br />My product came without the License Number or Product Number I needed to register it and keep it running.<br />I suspect that it was on the sales page which promptly disappeared when I paid.<br />After a lot of aggravation I found the numbers under my account on line and registered the product.<br />I ran a small business for 8 years with quickbooks ending about 8 years ago.<br />Imagine my surprise when I discovered that it will no longer do payroll.<br />That is additional software with a charge of about $39 per month plus $1.50 per employee per check.<br />I am a one man design and construction consulting company. That works!<br />Not only that but for Mac users (I just converted) they don't service all states.<br />But, you guessed it, you have to download a trial version (for \\""free\\"") to see what states those are!<br />I am really unhappy with Intuit, and slightly unhappy with Amazon for not revealing more information about the product.<br />The only way i figured this out is by trying to use the product and then scouring the intuit website for answers when I realized it wouldn't or didn't suit my needs.<br />Way too much money for something that will balance your checkbook, but won't run a business without hooking you on exorbitant fees."
228	-1	Pro's:<br />1. Decent Tax software.  Installed great, good tips for entering information.<br /><br />Con's:<br />1. Absolute worst marketing gimmicks.  They try to snag you with a Fee, get you to buy more stuff.  No help on filing through mail for state return.  Have to enter CC info to e-file to avoid a 29.99 fee that made me swear I would not buy anything from Inuit again.<br />2. Poor navigation, had to go through menu's several times.  FAQ and question search not real helpful.<br /><br />I would have gave 1 star, but unfortunately most companies pull these stunts now days.
229	-1	the program is decent for slideshow...<br />but once every month, it will start asking you passwords, computer id, keys, etc....and will deauthorized your computer in a heartbeat.<br />I had to buy it again because it was not recognize it in my computer and would not accept my passwords and ID's that were good.<br />I had to do a slideshow for next day, and I didn't have time to buy a different program and learn it.<br />Otherwise I would never buy the same.<br />Stay away from this one....to complicated to keep it alive. Once they have a new version...the old version will stop working...forcing you to buy again. I had few slideshows ready in my first version, but unable to burn dvd because I &#34;needed&#34; to buy new version.<br />huuuggggg......
230	0	I have used Norton products for years. I had 360 and had no problems but my subscription ran out so I ended up getting Security with Backup (assuming I had to as 360 evolved into this?). Now, I'm locked out of my Identity Safe and it keeps wanting me to &#34;Create an Account&#34;. I have read tons of complaints on this (too little to late) in the last day with no solid fixes. It looks like a MAJOR issue at hand for Norton. Until they fix this, I cannot recommend them for this product. I WISH I would have gone with McAfee instead (I had a computer tech friend tell me to switch, and I didn't listen to him. Shame on me). I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED in Norton! And ME for renewing with them!
231	-1	I am trying to cancel this stupid order with ho way to do so!!!~!!
232	0	This is a good system however it requires more internet access than I have on a daily basis to keep up to date and to use all the available tools.  If I had unlimited access to the internet, I would consider upgrading.
233	0	The product appears to do what I need it to do.  It does NOT provide you with a means of determining which update you have installed (bad code writing practices).  Also, updates are issued through the whole tax writing period, so if you complete your return you may or may not have sent your return in with the most recent and presumably correct update.
234	-1	I attempted to download this, but could not get it properly. I requested a refund and had to send the documents to Intuit.<br />Each time I called Intuit I was given a different &#34;EXCUSE&#34; as to why I have not received it. Some reps I talked with said it was being processed, some say there was nothing on file.<br /><br />This is by far the worse company I have ever dealth  with. Had I know this was to happen, I would have purchased a CD with 2013 from someone.
235	-1	I transferred from Windows version 2007 and everything transferred beautifully.  Today, only five days later, my Quickbooks started freezing up.  The home page started showing un deposited funds that I had deposited so I called the free customer support.  They told me that my data needed to be rebuilt for $299.00.  and this was not covered under my free technical support.  More than the cost of the program!  I'm so disappointed.  At least it happened before I entered lots of new transactions.  The real rub is how in human and indifferent the customer service reps behaved.  They really don't care.<br /><br />Update:  I got another customer service rep who was very helpful and brought my 2007 version up-to-date by transferring it to 2010 in windows.  Then he was able to transfer it successfully to my Mac 2013 and I haven't had any problems since.  I guess the most important thing to know is that you cannot transfer data from anything older than 2010 Windows software.  They really should let people know.  I hope this review will help others!
236	1	I've been using Quicken since the early 1990's, and I couldn't live without it. It gives me great visibility to where my money comes and goes, and allows me to see all of my accounts in one place. Most importantly, I can track my investments easily, and Quicken makes the process of preparing my tax return so much easier. I consider it one of the most important apps on my computer.
237	0	Since I installed my Windows 7, I have had two malwares contaminate my system under the Avast umbrella.  One, I can't get rid of, in spite of the instructions from them I followed.  Deltahomes.com is still commandeering.  I did find a work-around, but I am a little disappointed that their instructions didn't work.  I hope to resolve it soon so that I don't have that issue again.  I do realize that not ALL things may be caught ALL the time, but this was the second time something happened within four months, so I am wondering whether I have made the right decision to buy this product.  Thanks for asking.  Regards, Lyn
238	-1	No telling what else is not included; the software tells me that the IRS isn't charging me to e-file, but even though I purchased software with &#34;Five free federal e-files&#34;, somehow filing a Federal extension is not included and will cost an additional $19.95 (plus sales tax, as they are quick to remind me).<br /><br />Yay.  As if the IRS wasn't fun enough!
239	0	I like the face that it's now on my laptop, but it has seemed to make my laptop very slow with everything.
240	-1	Does not update to current numbers, will not import investments. I have done better with Mint and its free
241	-1	No Macs
242	0	I don't see that much difference from 2012.  If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have downloaded it.  The only advantage is that with 2014 one can access their info on a smart phone or tablet.
243	0	Works OK - there are some features I would like to have.  I need Home and Business version but can't afford Intuit's prices for the upgrade.
244	0	Our bank (which is a big name bank) would not cooperate with Quicken's program so it was rather useless and added more steps to our budgeting mess than we already had! It took a lot of work to figure out that we couldn't use it. Be sure BEFORE you buy Quicken that your bank is compatible with it!
245	0	The software is one of the best I have used to  maximize my refund, and its very user friendly.
246	-1	NOT for international employees as in United Nations staff.  The software does not calculate Self-Employment tax for our specific tax situations.
247	1	The bit defender antivirus plus is great!
248	0	I upgraded to 2014 from 2013.  I pretty well stay current.  So far the only real improvement I can see is after updating my finances I don't have to click to look and see what was downloaded and then close the window for each account.  They are all shown on same page.  This was a good update but such a no brainer it should have been that way all the time.  Just in case someone from Quicken ever reads this I will ask again.  When doing Find from register by select field and then right clicking I much preferred when that field's name was the default in Quicken Find window.  It once was that way but disappeared so long ago I don't remember which version took it away.
249	1	I have been using Norton security for years and have never had a problem.  This version is great because it now covers more than computers and the price was very worth it.
250	0	It works fairly well but gives me fits connecting with the bank for updates and frequently fails.  Most of the time I must do a manual download one account at a time and that is a real pain.
251	0	Had to upgrade from Basic to Premier to input my K-1 information. Inputting the K-1 data was not without problems. If you have a Partnership with an address outside the USA you would have to go to the Forms View to input the info directly onto the Form.  There were a couple of other 'bugs' that had to be worked around. Pretty sloppy, don't know who/whom Intuit had to beta-test this area of the program, but they did not do a very good job, IMHO.  I did not use any of the fancy Guides for inputting my tax information, I knew what and where I needed to input the data. Just a big waste of my money.  I did not have any problems inputting data for the Partnership K-1s with last years 'Basic' version of TurboTax.  I think Three Stars is more than generous for this version of TurboTax, if you have Partnership K-1s to input.
252	1	We have been very satisfied using the avast free antivirus software for several years now. The product came recommended to us from a very reputable business and were happy to see that the download was available through the cnet website. We have many other cnet downloads that we are also very satisfied with.
253	0	The software is good but Intuit's business model is a failure. I have been a loyal TurboTax customer since the 90s but this will be my last  year. I talked to many people that dropped the product this year and expect there will be many more next year. At the rate Intuit is going there will only be two software packages in the future. A very basic package and a very expensive package because they keep moving standard features into a higher priced product.
254	-1	I'm adding my voice to the litany of complaints about Intuit's changes in TurboTax for tax year 2014.  I've been using TurboTax Basic since the DOS days and it has handled my tax situation well, including stock transactions (Sched. D) and a small home business or two (Sched. C, Form 8829, and depreciation).  I have also needed the forms view from time to time, including to confirm TurboTax errors that had to be overridden (confirmed by talking to their tech support and a tax expert).  Now all of that is going away.  In fact, it looks like I can't even get the same functionality out of Deluxe or Premier, but need to upgrade all the way to Home & Business which costs $100.  That's pretty outrageous, in my opinion.  If this were the first time, I might wait and see if Intuit changes their strategy, since so many long-time customers are angry about this.  But we've seen this pattern of greedy over-reaching from Intuit before.  I'm tired of it.<br /><br />So, like many of you, I'm looking at a change.  Many of you say you are going to H&R Block.  PC Magazine's review of 2013 tax software actually rated TaxACT above TurboTax, and TurboTax above H&R Block.  So, I'm wondering why everyone is talking about H&R Block but not TaxACT.  I'd be interested to hear from anyone who has compared both products from the perspective of a converted TurboTax user.  What are the pros/cons of each product, and how easy to migrate from TurboTax?  (I have no financial interest in any of these companies or products.  My goal is to understand what to commit to next, realizing that whatever it is, I'll probably be with it for a long time, as I was with TurboTax).<br /><br />Thanks for your help!
255	1	Worth every penny, The best $21.50 That I ever spent! Paid for itself in the first ten min. after download! There was a concert that I wanted the dvd that cost $25.00. I found the whole thing on You-Tube, Downloaded it, threw it on a flash drive & Was watching it on my big screen in 10 min. Plus it was in HD!!! I had no problems with the download, It's very easy to use ( I had tried the free version off of c-net With a ten day trail. I was going to buy it from them but it was $30.00. I checked Amazon, It was $25.00 & I put it on my wishlist. When I went back a few weeks later to buy it, It had dropped to $21.50
256	1	I have used Turbo Tax for years. It is very easy to use. I received my refund check in 10 days after I filed electronically.
257	1	I got what I was expecting.  I would recommend this product.  Not invasive, and so far, no problems with it.
258	-1	This program is adequate. It does most of what its supposed to until you manually try to add transactions. I added transactions because it told me it needed me to, yet it added double debits and double credits based on my description. For my basic budget/check book balancing needs I prefer a pen paper and filing cabinet.
259	-1	Webroot installed really fast and although I had some installation problems, the customer service reps were courteous, patient and helpful.  They explained the difficulties as we went along.  I installed Webroot on both of my PCs with no problem (again, very quick), but when I tried to install it on my Mac, I ran into problems.  Apparently, they are still working out some bugs with the Mac version, but like I said, the reps were wonderful.  I will give it five stars when the Mac version installation goes more smoothly.<br /><br />I would like to add that although there are not many controls with Webroot for the Mac, but the scan is extremely fast, it took only 6 mins. to scan my entire Mac and less time with my PC.  I hope Webroot will work on adding more controls for Mac, but I am confident I have an excellent AV.<br /><br />It's been about 2 weeks now and although the customer service has been very good, I am still having problems with Webroot on my Mac during updates.  I would tell Mac users to pass on this program.  If the problems were only with the Mac, I would give this a one star rating, but Webroot is great on my PCs and has more options.<br /><br />I am finally giving this product one star (I would give it no stars if I could).  It does not work on my Mac and Webroot folks seemed to give up on me.  I did get a quick refund.  Again, I think Mac users should avoid downloading this product until Webroot gets it together with the Mac version.  I think they went into making a product for Mac too quickly without properly testing it.  One of the customer reps even admitted to me they were having problems with Macs.
260	0	BEWARE!! of the total cost. Intuit sucks you in with what looks like a great deal initially and then charges you for what should be included in any normal tax return. 39.99 for adding a state, 19.99 per state for e-filing and if your tax scenario is a little bit complicated more add on charges await you. All told my bill from Intuit was $140. I have been using TurboTax for 10 years now and have been an evangelist for it for many years. This year however I felt duped. Treat us like adults Intuit, be transparent with the costs of filing a normal return. Let people make the decision based on functionality. Most of us are not looking forward to tax season, why aggravate us further? Had it not been for the identity theft brouhaha Intuit would have had no reason to give discounts this year. Very unfortunate that what was a good customer friendly product has finally been swallowed up by corporate malaise and duplicity.
261	-1	I made the mistake of upgrading an old 1999 version, which worked fine, to the 2010 version which has all the fancy bells and whistles but handles none of the basics very well. For instance there is no font size adjustment, and when you download your bank activity it doesn't match the entries you placed in Quicken, so it doubles up on every entry, clears none, and is beyond useless for reconcilation purposes. Try contacting customer service, they don't know what customer service is anymore. Based on my personal experiences with Quicken, and the terrible reviews they continue to have, it is apparent that they have no meaningful contact or knowledge base from the folks who actually use their product. This is a classic case of a company that spends too much time looking at it's bottom line, and forgetting what it took to be successful in the 1st place. I just can't trust them to do an upgrade to the 2014 edition. They sent me an upgrdae packet and disc, but it has no meaningful information about it's 2014 capabilities, and no reference to how to contact customer service. The only people you can easily contact at Quicken are sales personnel, who don't know much about the product.
262	-1	I feel this is an overpriced ripoff, State e file no longer included, really more than I need but felt required to buy because I am an independent contractor.
263	0	Didn't want to upload at first stated needed Windows XP. After playing with it was able to upload to computer. The product itself is EXCELLENT though and well worth the money.
264	-1	I have used Turbo Tax since the 90's and have always been happy.  I was very surprised to see the very low reviews when I went to purchase it.  I then began to read what I would be getting and I am very disappointed with the changes.  I purchased H&R block instead.  Turbo Tax shame on you!  You've lost another customer.
265	-1	It doesn't show up to let me know it's scanning.  Old one would let me know when it scanned.  All at once Chrome google doesn't accept Norton Toolbar. Won't buy this next time.
266	0	I don't like it too much. Simple if we cut films from different cameras and an audio track together, then this program is simple very unhandy and overcomplicated.To fill the gabs from different tracks together,- it is very unhandy, needs a lot of nerves, don't get impatience... I don't need all the fancy stuff, I need fast solution, a program what never brake down, so to do it again... I have tried 4 programs already, was over frustrated for the unstable programs (lost everything) and then I decided for camtasia studio 8.4, it is over expensive but stress free and easy, uncomplicated to use....
267	0	disappointing that after paying extra to file state return electronically, still must mail hard copies of W-2 and 1099 forms to Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.  I shall request a return from TurboTax in the amount of $19.00
268	-1	Does not account for Electric Vehicle credits or other items that pertain to a small percentage of filers. TurboTax does account for these items. Keep this in mind if using H&R Block.
269	0	Its' MS office, but unfortunately nowadays Microsoft wants everyone to create an account with them as a requirement to use software which has been legally purchased. Sadly, it seems another distasteful scheme on top of the several DRM and data mining schemes already in place by Microsoft. The compulsory &#34;membership&#34; with Microsoft to use purchased products is in bad taste. This is especially true if one has no desire to use online features but is forced to.
270	0	I've used Quicken for years and its always been good.  I had a corruption problem and lost my files a while ago and thought I needed to buy Quicken again.  I had a better version from 2009 and didn't realize until after I made this purchase that I could still access the 2009 one.  I actually prefer the 2009 home and office because it had more functionality whereas this one is very basic, so I'm not really using it.
271	0	I was a little disappointed what how basic it was, but maybe that is because it is web-based program through whatever browser you use. For the most part, it does include everything you need to write up and present a great business plan. For example, it goes over forecasting, target markets, benchmarking, marketing, etc.<br /><br />I would recommend it only if you get a good deal on the subscription. I used a gift card, but I think if I would of spent my own money, I would have been more annoyed.
272	1	Good experience will order again
273	0	I was very pleased with the software and the step by step inductions. My only compliant is with the use of the State filing of the software. Once the federal section was completed, and you selected the state for doing the state section a message popped up stating that you have one free subscription for e-filing the state return and would you like to use it now. I selected yes and continued doing the taxes. However, after the state was completed, and the e-file option was subjected. The software would not let you process the return without first paying for it. I first though that this was hardcoded into the software and that Turbo would later wave the charge. I was proven wrong by the charge showing up on my credit card. If I had known this would be the case I would have mailed my return.
274	0	I have used both H&R Block and Turbotax for years.  I liked H&R better because it's better value, but this year's edition seemed more difficult to navigate and wished I used Turbotax.  Every time I got the program started, it would take me to the &#34;help&#34; section, and I had a hard time going to the section I left off and it was frustrating.
275	1	This software is good for amateur videographers. So far I have imported and worked with AVI, MP4, MPEG, TS files using this software. If a file's resolution is not compatible, instead of giving you an incompatibility error like some other editing programs would do, the software offers to adjust it for you. If you try to export a video that you finished editing in a different resolution than the original, your scenes, or even your voice sync will be all mixed up.<br />I have cut out scenes from a video recorded in 720p and tried exporting it in 1080p only to see those same scenes still in my video. Exporting to the same resolution is no problem.<br />My only other issue is speed. The better your system, the faster this software will work. I'm running Windows 7 Professional with a 4 core Phenom II, and 8 gigs of ram. It takes about an hour and a half to export 45 min of 720p video, maybe about 2.5 to 3 hours for 45 min of 1080p. Upgrading the cpu, ram, and graphics card would make this software run a lot faster.<br />The audio features are great. The software, can eliminate background noise from your videos. I eliminated hissing noise from a wireless microphone. I don't use a clapper for syncing separate audio. I just keep moving the track left or right until I get it lined up right.<br />I would recommend this if you can't afford professional editing software.
276	0	Happens to be a great product, one I've used for many years.<br />So why only 3 stars?<br />Well, it's like this. You are confined to file the exact same profile year-to-year if you wish to import historical data (And who doesn't? Name/Address/SS ##/Employer, etc.)<br />But what if circumstances dictate that we file separately? Oh sure, there's a 'what-if' option.<br />BUT IT IS A LEDGER *ONLY* AND WILL NOT CREATE 2 DISCRETE RETURNS!<br />So start new ones from scratch? And what if next year I've got to return to joint? Huh? What then?<br />And this is why I can't give it a higher rating (probably being too kind as it is)...
277	1	Good Software
278	1	Avast Free Antivirus was recommended to me by someone who upgraded my computer. I was skeptical at first but Avast is doing a great job! I have not had any issues since using it and was notified of a virus in my computer. Avast was able to prevent it from harming my computer as well as the well-known anti-virus I had previously. Thank you Avast for keeping my computer safe!.
279	1	Just what i needed. Smooth transaction.
280	-1	This version would not properly install on my computer.  The download kept freezing up and after it finally did download it would not install.  I have a 64 bit operating system with Windows 7 installed.  I have 100 mg RAM with a 1 terabyte hard drive.  I have used TurboTax in the past and not sure why the download on Amazon would not work on my computer.
281	-1	Paying monthly?  Nah.  There are better alternatives out there that don't require you to spend hundreds every year.  Adobe just wants to rip their customers off, and make tons of money for themselves.
282	0	Federal return was pretty straight forward and not much of a hassle. The state returns are a complete different story. Not only do they charge you $34.95 for a second state's forms, but also charge you $19.95 to file an extra state. The state return process needs some additional work. The software told me multiple times to check the form it filled out for a number, isn't that the whole idea of having the software calculate the numbers so it could plug them in....
283	1	I love it
284	0	I have been a paintshop pro user since way before Corel aquired the product - way back to &#34;version 8&#34;. Since corel took the product over, it's usefulness has diminished for me, mainly because of how the product's user interface is designed. Rather than go into all of that here, I'll focus on X6. I decided (based on the &#34;high reviews&#34; on Amazon) to upgrade from X4 to X6. Mistake. There's zero noticeable difference between the two versions, (save the slight performance degradation with X6) despite the marketing hype. The &#34;64 bit architecture&#34; that PSP X6 boasts seems to actually run slower than X4 in my 64 bit Windows 7 environment. Other than that, I literally cannot see any difference in the two products at all. When I first started up X6 and took a look around I had to look at the title bar of the product because I thought I had started X4 by mistake. From what I see so far, it looks like the same product with &#34;X4&#34; changed to &#34;X6&#34;.
285	-1	Forced to buy because version I had &#34;expired&#34; according to Quicken. New version, I have had nothing but problems since download and very slow.
286	-1	incredibly complicated process for downloading the product key after purchase.  DO  NOT BUY it in this form.  Order the disks instead.
287	1	Plays Blu-ray Disc great!
288	1	Good
289	1	Great product.<br /><br />I got the free trail and loved it, so decided to buy the full thing. Awesome quality and definitely worth it. I got it for only $20 when it was on sale on Amazon. Would have bought it even if it was the full $80.<br /><br />Definitely would recommend this to anyone who will not engage in crazy editing, mostly good for the beginner or the one who will not be adding crazy effects to your video (For that go with Cinema 4d, Photoshop, or Sony Vegas Pro)
290	0	Considering I got it for free, I don't have much room to complain about it. However, when you put it next to any top tier editing program, Sony Movie Studio 13 pales in comparison.
291	1	I like it very well. It has stopped several viruses. I have used this product for several years. I would recommend it for anyone.
292	1	A member of our IT department at work uses AVAST on her home computers and recommended it to me. I don't recall exactly how long I have been using it, but it has been at least five years. I have been very pleased with it. It has  kept me virus-free (but for one time), unlike some of the other major antivirus software out there. I had constant problems with those other antivirus programs prior to switching to AVAST. Also, unlike those other programs, AVAST doesn't &#34;pester&#34; me constantly, or insist on doing things I don't ask or want it to do - nor does it go to war with other software I have installed on my computer. Consequently, I have recommended it to many other people. Thanks, AVAST - keep up the good work!
293	0	The negative reviews here don't seem to be from long time users; this program always had a rather steep learning curve.  You always had to spend time learning it.  I went from Poser Six (of Curious Labs), to P 9 (of Smith Micro--it changed ownership), and it's like going from driving a ten year old car to a new one, in one swoop.  There are the new Diffuse IBL lights, and subsurface scattering , for example.  It pretty much performs the same, but there are drawbacks...the native figures are less than exemplary, compared with P 6's...they went down a notch there.  I don't care so much, I use DAZ's characters.  You have to hit &#34;save&#34; often if you don't want it to hang.  And even with the quad core computer I have, and 8 gigs of RAM, it doesn't cooperate well if you load your scenes down with figure morphs and a lot of detail. (I believe it can only &#34;see&#34; about 2-3 gigs of RAM.)  I also have Poser Pro 2010 but don't use it much, so I don't know if it's a cut above this. Pluses, it's customizable  and it would seem you can build a huge library of add-ons--figures, morphs, lights, etc..  And yes, If you also own Vue software, you can export figures to the scenery building capability of that program.  (though Vue is even more of a bear to learn.) Get a good book or two and take time to learn it, because with what you CAN do with it, you'll have fun. I just wish they'd come up with better figures than the Curious Labs version, AND hope someday they can simulate collisions a bit better. So all in all, for me anyway, it's better the devil you know than the one you don't and I just can't see spending the outrageous amounts of money they want for other, similar programs.  If you want to go to CGI movie land, this is not the way to go. BTW, artists, if you find paying for models expensive and potentially troublesome, this is one way to go...Poser models don't get tired or slouch, so you can leave them where you put them and draw or paint referring to your computer screen, with traditional media...:)
294	-1	Well It didn't work for me period. No radio stations loading, just said connecting to server, There was only 4 TV stations in my list CBS, CNN, NBC, and USA World, those didn't load, I clicked on Music videos, every single one I clicked on said it was unavailable. didn't find my webcam, so that didn't work. I didn't even bother to try any other functions.  Program is just a Big POS , even though it was free, it's still not worth downloading cause nothing works. I even updated it and still nothing. Amazon would be smart to get this off there site!
295	1	This has been really easy to work with and I've never done video editing before.  I feel like it makes video editing really really easy.  I'm happy with this purchase and have been using it to edit videos for my youtube channel.  The features make it so easy to just drag and drop all your media into the program and then drag and drop it into the editor.  Would buy this again.
296	0	This ok backup if you need to backup and don't want to used windows this not bad
297	1	Great Product
298	-1	Product records video but only keeps first 10 minutes of the entire show. Going to website for support or information is a joke
299	0	Frankly, I was disappointed I had to pay for the state filing, especially since Turbotax advertised it would free!!!
300	-1	Tech support tried to be helpful, but ultimately this software could not be sufficiently customized for my needs.  GoodSync ended up having the features I needed.
301	-1	Wow, sounds like TT needs to come clean with a public apology! I've been using TT for the past 5 years and I always get the small biz version. So change does not impact me directly, but I'm now pissed too! This goes against everything that is: honesty, integrity and American way! These deceptive tactics will not work, and as you can see consumers will flock to H&R Block, if anything out of sprite. I know I will.  Major FAIL!
302	-1	"The customer service through turbotax is horrible. They hung up on me twice, and after waiting for an hour and a half, the person on the telephone transferred me to another department. In the process of the transfer, the agent hung up on me. Then I received an email saying my case had been closed because I was disconnected, and if I wanted to address it again, I could call in an wait in line again to get help. Given they had my phone number and my email address, it would have been easy to call me back or email me. But no, it was easier for them to just close my case. Further, they only allow you to upgrade. I went to view the site and decide which option to choose, I looked at the premier, and then went to the site to learn more about the product. In the process, I was assigned the premier (more expensive) version. There is no way to change to a \\""lower\\"" product once you have been assigned. They will take more of your money and move you to a more expensive product, but never back to a more appropriate product. They have hung up or disconnected me at least 5 times now. They provided me a service code that did not work. They care nothing about what customers need or want, they mislead customers, and entrap them into buying more expensive software than the tax filer needs for their taxes. This is a horrible company, and I would suggest any tax software over intuit and turbotax. They are deceitful liars."
303	1	QuickBooks is a very efficient program. I absolutely love it!
304	0	"Follow up 4/26/2012: after a second email to quicken customer service.  The second agent to reply told me not to worry about the emails warning me that I would lose online account update - that those warning emails were based on my copy of Quicken 2009 that I have registered in my quicken.com account.  The first agent who replied to my inquiry must have not read the request carefully enough.  It seems the only way to have your current Quicken version to show up in your quicken.com account is to purchase or upgrade through quicken.com.  I'll know for sure that my online account update services will still be available when I try it after April 30.  It would be more comforting to see my current version listed when I log into my quicken.com account.<br /><br />The second agent to reply sent me instructions how to reset Quicken registration so that you can ensure quicken is registered.  If Register quicken is not available in the Help menu, that should mean Quicken is registered.  To reset: 1. Open the Quicken desktop software and select the Help menu and select Register Quicken.  Note: If you do not have the option to Register Quicken, press the Alt+Ctrl+Shift keys and then select the Tools menu and select One Step Update. Click OK at the \\""Registration has been cleared\\"" prompt, and then repeat step 2. 2. Complete the registration process and enter your existing Quicken.com Member ID and password when prompted.<br /><br />If the problem persists, I would suggest to completely uninstall Quicken .<br /><br />My original review:<br /><br />Warning  - you cannot register this version to your quicken.com account.  I received an email from Quicken saying my online services are expiring, based on my previous edition of Quicken 2009.<br /><br />My upgrade to Quicken 2011 Deluxe through Amazon download offers no way to register it - there is no register link in the Help menu as described in Quicken Help, so you cannot use online services e.g. update bank balances after your old version expires.  I contacted Quicken and they responded that there is no way to register this Quicken.  Their response: \\""Thank you for contacting Quicken Customer Care.  I would like to inform you that the program that you are using now is no more supported and you can not register the program now.\\""  Even though I purchased Quicken 2011 Deluxe through Quicken, Quicken told me there is no way to register it.  Neither through a menu pick or by logging in to my Quicken account.<br /><br />Quicken Discontinuation Policy, Updated: 4/18/2012 | Article ID: GEN82218<br /><br />\\""When you purchase a Quicken product, the ability to use online services like downloading your transactions and balances, online bill pay, and live support are available for the current version and the two prior year versions.

305	-1	I have used an earlier version of quicken, but wanted to get an updated version.  I found installation easy, and it successfully transferred my old data.  What Quicken failed to do was be reliable and be easy to use.  After  2 hours spent trying to make it download transactions from my bank, it finally did it successfully.  Then the next time I booted the computer, it lost the connection and multiple years of transactions, everything back to 2007.  Of course there was a backup, but you are never really sure you got everything, and the connection to the bank was gone too.  And it lost the bank passwords I had stored too.  Another three hours reconfiguring, because quicken doesn't really want you to store passwords, and it believes the bank wants you to change it the first time you log in, even thought that is not true, and I was back to the previous day.  The help feature is extremely weak, and it is difficult to find directions on how to perform tasks.  Quicken needs some competition, so they can provide an honest product.
306	-1	Found it cumbersome, slow, and not helpful at all in organizing and analyzing accounts.
307	-1	I changed from Quicken premier 2010 to 2013. I found 2013 to be significantly slower and the Savings Goals feature to be much harder to use. I use the savings goals to allocate funds to different purposes in a single real account. 2010 allowed you to see all of the SGs in one compact form. The 2013 version is much more spread out and less useable.
308	-1	Expected a self/contained book not piece/meal monthly charged.
309	0	I worked for Intuit for 6 years, including managing teams in both product development and marketing. TurboTax is a solid product and they're the industry leader for a reason.  But everyone should know that they have a large team dedicated to testing pricing and up-sells (hidden charges). This change was made to optimize revenue, plain and simple. That's their prerogative, they're a business after all. Bob Meighan is a great guy but it's job to sell the public on these types of business decisions.<br /><br />There are plenty of other options, some better in my opinion. Checkout Common Form or TaxAct. Both have more fair and transparent pricing. (Disclosure: I'm the CEO of Common Form).
310	0	earlier versions were more user friendly.product sometimes confusing and inconsistent
311	0	Everything works fine but for some reason Excel does not work very well (it keeps going blank if you press esc by mistake).
312	-1	not too useful
313	-1	I had delayed upgrading and did not download financial data for several months prior to the upgrade.<br /><br />What happened was the financial downloads duplicated many times for one account. There was no consistency for this. Some of the downloads like deposits were duplicate posting in the Quicken register at least four to six times on one download.<br /><br />Even worse, when I accepted the information, the automatic bill pay items were duplicated but the duplicates did not match as to who the payee was. Could some hidden setting be automatically labeling the memo field? How would I figure that out. How this happened was beyond comprehension because it never happened with previous versions of Quicken.<br /><br />Now to use the program I have to contact help or figure it out on my own and verify every single line item with the account registry. Then hope it does not happen again. Torture.<br /><br />PS: I have been using Quicken for over six years.
314	-1	After installing Panda, my internet connection became unstable.  Chrome did not work at all and IE took 5 minutes to load a simple yahoo page (when it actually worked).  I tried customer service which routes you to a FAQ which was not very helpful for my particular issue.  I still have not spoken to any one live despite trying to do so.  We'll see how the refund process works.
315	1	I looked around at different stores and then visited Amazon online and I have absolutely no regrets.  It only took a couple of minutes to download and I wrote down the product key when the box came up for me to click install.  I could have copied and pasted the key, but I wanted to write it down first and then install. It was so simple to install Norton.  It works perfect and I am absolutely pleased.  Thank you Amazon.com  Sincerely, Jess
316	1	Over the years, I've been a user of Symantec, AVG and now avast! I switched from the first because I found it so bloated with &#34;features&#34; and sales pitches my computer barely ran. AVG was the darling for years, and then it too became bloated, and full of advertisements. avast! seems to have gotten a good balance of protection, and I've been happy with it for over 3 years.
317	1	Memorang is a great tool to test and consolidate information after a study session! I appreciate the multiple study modes.
318	0	I just rebought TT. I used H&R Block for the last 5 years and found it overall equivalent to TT which I had used before. Last year (2013) I tried both HRB and TT back to back just to see if there were differences and found they were still largely equivalent. One advantage TT has is that it takes charitable payroll deductions from your W-2 and moves them to the deduction schedule A. H&R Block doesn't pick this up and the amount needs to be reentered manually or can be missed altogether. TT had better scripting on K-1 entries Other than that, I couldn't find an advantage to TT. The reason I am investing in TT again is the Refund Bonus. If you are a PRIME customer, you get a discount bringing the price down to $55, which is still more than H&R Block Premium.<br /><br />BUT, if you are like my family, Prime deliveries come to your home several times a week. Getting your refund in Amazon gift credits with a 10% bonus more than pays for TT. This year I expect a rebate, so I will get TT. in the future, if expect to owe money, I'll go through HRB . Regarding the removal of features in TT Deluxe, I don't know what Intuit was thinking.  What do they think the marginal value of their product over HRB might be that would justify $30 more? As someone who has used both in the last year, I sure don't see it. HRB should be able to pick up market share this year.  If you are unsure, give HRB a try
319	1	Great product. Easy to use for all kinds of videos.
320	-1	Last year for me. In the past  Turbo ax has recommend premier for people with investments, but Deluxe has always been  fine for my needs.  Now this year to do anything but the most basic investment information I have to upgrade to Premier?<br />No thanks. They've got me this year, unless I can try H&R Block tax software for free. I read that somewhere online H&R Block was offering such a thing.<br /><br />The product should have been clear that it would not process the investment info that it has in year's past prior to purchase.
321	-1	Could not download. Folled the instructions for tech support. Ended up in India, found out that the software was not what I needed, switched to a different product offered by the 3rd party.  3rd party service good so far but I'll never use either again!
322	1	I literally have to have this.  I have no other method of batch changing photos.  I have quite literally 3 tbs of photos.  At any given point they were ORFS or whatever Canon does.
323	1	Very helpful in tracking where you are financially.
324	0	Happy to get away from the Microsoft money pit having to either purchase 360 annually or get a dated software app.  I like the open office. Only complaint is that some functionality is lost. Copy and paste don't take the latest version of spreadsheets. Scrolling goes very fast. Comment box size is not selectable.  It is working for me right now, but I may look for other software.
325	0	Easy to shoot video, but hard to edit them. I can't seem to open the files in anything other than their own editor, which I found hard to use. But still, getting the video was easy enough
326	0	I'm in my '30s and I grew up playing the old DOS Carmen games and watching Where In The World game show on PBS. But, that time is gone. This is Carmen for a new generation..better graphics and a different type of interaction entirely. Is it as fun? I really have to say it's not because the challenge of solving x number of cases and memorizing what clues mean isn't there. If your around my age, don't buy this game to show kids what the older games were like. Go on YouTube instead. But, if you want to introduce Carmen to a new generation in a fun, exciting and different way..go ahead and buy it. Just disable your security software during download. I think they ought to release a USA version of this game and have multiple cases for it, like the classic USA versions.
327	-1	the program will not play blu-ray.  read reviews before buying (i didn't).  NOTE: AMAZON STEPPED UP AND REFUNDED FOR PURCHASE OF DOWNLOADED PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY AFTER I ASKED. YAY AMAZON.
328	1	Totally surpasses Norton for computer virus coverage. Have been using avast! for years - would not use any other program
329	-1	In my opinion, Quicken 2013 is useless. It does not allow you to track a paycheck in the budget.  I asked Intuit about this problem and was told they recognize the problem but do not have a fix for it yet nor did they know when the problem would be fixed.  The version of Quicken I was using is no longer supported.  I asked if I could get a complimentary version of the last one (other than 2013) that was supported until the problem was fixed and was told no. Because of this experience I intend to never buy an Intuit product including Turbo Tax again.
330	-1	I have been using Quicken for years and it has always worked great. This version is so unstable I can't work on it for more than half an hour without it crashing, I've had to close and reopen different accounts. I contacted support and their response was &#34;I have just checked with my resources and I am sorry to inform you that this is a know issue with Quicken 2014 program.Our product development team is working on it and you would be notified as soon as the issue gets resolved.&#34;  So basically they have sold a program they know doesn't work.
331	0	I'm in a big problem involving 1099's(2 of them) corrections recieved after filing! Now I question the correctness of the original workup????
332	0	I had no issues with this except that there was a fee to file even the first state return. It was not worth the additional cost and I should have just bought the basic federal without the state.
333	0	Good product
334	-1	Did not accomplish what I wanted which was to convert PDF files to editable Word files.  Converted to Word but not editable.  Ended up getting Adobe.
335	-1	This software did not perform as expected. It was a total waste of money.
336	0	Only problem was it getting stuck in one spot and not moving. Otherwise love turbo tax
337	1	I've used AVAST for a number of years and love it.  I had used both McAfee and Norton in the past and have found AVAST to be superior.  I have had absolutely no problems since switching to AVAST on the advice of a friend who trouble shoots all the computers for a large school district.
338	-1	Don't do it!  Don't upgrade.  I was effectively forced into upgrading to keep the online connections.  I get it, Intuit needs to make money.  I don't mind paying for an upgrade and improved product.  But, this is not an improved product.  The upgrade process trashed my file.  Almost nothing works.  Tried everything; reloading the software, restoring old files, Verifying... and spending two hours with Quicken technical support.  Quicken was of zero help.  It is not functional.  When I close the file and reopen it loses six months of data, nice.  Cannot export or even create reports of my old data.<br /><br />Looking for a functional alternative.
339	-1	It's ok if you like being constantly interrupted by a message saying my trial version has expired.When you've never had a trial version and you just paid for a one year subscription.Then you have to log into the Norton website and have it re install
340	1	awesome
341	1	This is a great piece of software for working on your images.
342	1	In order to use bitlocker, your computer must have a TPM chip in it.  If not, you can turn bitlocker on but have to use a USB drive to hold the key file every time you boot it up.  An acceptable solution for a desktop, but for a laptop a bit of an inconvenience having a USB drive sticking out of it, plus it takes up a USB port.  My 2 month old Dell XPS laptop had the option of having Win 7 Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate installed, so I assumed I could upgrade afterwards.  Turns out they must only put that chip into models shipping with Ultimate already.  So double check that if bitlocker is important to you.    Other than this issue, the update process was quick and painless.  It seemed to take less time than installing a regular software program since it didn't have to load off the CD and do a lot of registry changing.    Ultimate itself with the XP mode seems a good upgrade for me.  A few hardware items and some software just doesn't work with Win 7.  Plus I needed encryption for some files.  While I use some third party encryption, it's just easier for some files if the OS does it without having to log into another software.  Some of the other differences between Ultimate and Professional aren't relevant to me, so Professional was probably a better match.    3/28/11 Additional note: Found a website that says the TPM chip not only handles the encryption key, it actually does the encrypting and decrypting activity so that the CPU does not have to.  When using a USB drive for the key, the CPU does the encrypting/decrypting which reduces performance.
343	-1	I've never given a product 1 star in a review.  If zero stars were an option, that would be my choice.  Other, virtually unanimous, negative reviews represent my frustrations well.  Going to the subscription service only model was a slap in the face of those of us who have used Adobe products legally for years.  This is compounded by Adobe's incredibly ham fisted and arrogant implementation.  I'm actively looking at alternatives.
344	1	I paid for this, and at FIRST, got nothing except a screwed up screen.    Then, I clicked the link for the update, and got another screen that finally had the code.  JUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO CLOSE ANY BROWSER WINDOWS BEFORE YOU FIND YOUR CODE, and make SURE your popup blocker is turned off. That seems to screw this up.    Really bad UI/UX - but, a great deal on something that Garmin themselves sell for $119.99.
345	0	The download process was not easy for me.  The new look of the program on the computer is terrible and I do not like the current updates.
346	-1	Turbotax Premier 2014 has prominent and potentially very costly problems with the features for which you're paying extra.  If your tax situation is simple, and you don't e-file, you could probably be satisfied with the free or inexpensive online versions of TurboTax.  But I have a few complications, and in the past TurboTax Deluxe was good enough.  This year, they modified their feature sets, so I opted for TurboTax Premier.  What a disaster.<br />The problems are:<br />1) The interface for handling ISOs and ESPP stock transactions is cumbersome.  I know tax rules changed, but it is much more cumbersome than the interface from Turbotax 2013, while the information needed for the new tax rules really is NOT much more.<br />2) Handling disposition of partnership interests where a 1099 was also issued is about as bad as it gets.  You can handle it with TurboTax 2014, but there is enough paper tracking, manual calculation, and manual entry that the software provides no benefit vs. doing it on paper the old school way.<br />3) WORST OF ALL, there appears to be a security leak that allowed fraudulent e-filing of Federal taxes, so that the perpetrators could get refunds deposited to ad hoc bank accounts.<br /><br />Buying Turbotax Premier 2014 was a total waste of money, and I look forward to joining the class action suit for the security issue.  Thanks to good timing in dealing with the fraudulent e-file, I'm only taking a loss for the cost of Turbotax Premier, but honestly that's about all I expect a class action suit would get me.
347	0	My boys were really excited about this program. It installed fine on Windows XP, but gives us the blue screen of death either upon start-up or just a few minutes into the the program. The games look fun and engaging. I just wish it would have worked. Pretty expensive to test and find out it won't work on my computer! I had read the reviews and made sure I got the one for XP. I won't be buying any more download-able software.
348	1	I don't do a lot of video recording these days, but when I do, I want it to be quick to setup and simple to use, but still be able to provide good quality. My PC desperately needs some upgrades; so right now I can't record AA games with Fraps because I'm already struggling with performance and Shadowplay is even worse. Tested this out with Witcher 3 and no problems, woo!<br /><br />Recording video goes up to 2560x1980 resolution (which I haven't seen before), records at 60FPS (or whatever lower number you choose) and in .avi or .wmv. You can also turn off capturing the cursor, which is super nice. Microphone can be recorded in a second audio track, making it easier to clean up and apply later - not that anyone particularly wants to hear my charming Welsh accent.<br /><br />It also lets you save screenshots in any of the 4 formats (bmp, jpg, png, gif) which I like and I streamed for several hours to a friend direct to Twitch, which was way easier for me, as a very small-scale streamer than setting up xSplit, although I think overall there were less options/customisability - you can still use the overlay to add webcam direct through D3DGear.<br /><br />I've been using Fraps for around 5 years now, and whilst it is easy to use, the one major drawback (for me) is the absolutely massive file size. D3DGear records and compresses, thus making files a fraction of the size which makes storage much easier for me. If I had to describe it, I'd say it's an improved fraps meets a simplfied XSplit.<br /><br />There's a free 15 day trial on their website, so you don't have to take my word for it - if you're interested in recording or streaming you should definitely check it out.<br /><br />Note: I didn't purchase this through Amazon, but own and have tested it extensively through Steam.
349	0	Kind of ok, but a couple of bugs (or are they features?):<br /><br />Check reconciliation:  Quicken totals up ALL the prior transactions (not including those you might have manually marked 'Reconciled' or changed a reconcilied amt) to come up with a starting balance....regardless of what you put in the recon details screen.  To be fair, quicken does allow you to ask it to come up with adjusting transactions.  I've been using quicken from 1999 and this change caught me off guard and took a while to figure out what was happening and how/why to let the adjustments take place...<br /><br />Reports:  some some reason, I still don't know, one of my mutual fund accounts (VWINX is the only one, and this applies to 2 different accounts) does not come through correctly into my Net Worth report if I use 'latest dates'.  The details are all correct in the account and the value of the account is correct in the account bar...just not in the report.  If I use a some other date type, the report is correct.<br /><br />I'm also not a fan of forcing users to upgrade to the next version every 3 years to maintain online downloads.<br /><br />These are the only 'bugs/features' I've had problems with in all my years.
350	-1	The tech crew drop the ball I have quicken but can't use it I'm filling a claim now against the tech company they ruined my computer and I st do not have the quicken working like I did for the last eight years it sucks and now I have no quicken if u know a tech crew that speaks English please let me know I can't even rate  this it was 3 weeks of hell
351	0	It is not easy to figure out how to do a spread sheet.  I can not figure thing out easily.
352	1	For years now I've been using TurboTax and been very happy with how it walks me through the whole process. Easy to use. Wishlist - I wish it included free e-file to at least one state as well.
353	0	Very buggy. MP4 issues all the time. The input MP4 has to match the output file and the renderer can't see any errors or it locks up. I have struggled for hours trying to find the issue. It will also lock up saving as any HD video output. I would request a refund if it wasn't a download.
354	-1	Keeps crashing and doesn't respond to things I try and have it do.
355	-1	I asked the seller about this product and would it convert AVCHD format to DVD playable on my DVD player format and then burn it to a blank DVD but I never got any type of response.  This was weeks ago.  I guess this seller doesn't need to make any sales.  So I'd like to provide my own answer and hope that this will help anyone else with the same problem.  So the one star rating is based on the seller and not the product itself. Solution I found successful follows below.<br /><br />  Sony Movie Studio Platinum suite worked for me on my HP pavillion slimline Win7 OS. !Warning! Lots and lots and lots of features and stuff that I have no idea how to do and it's looking to be a very long process of learning how to take advantage of the many features this product has. But it's a very reasonably low price for software of this nature and if you don;t care to have any high tech features on your DVD end result then this will do just fine but make sure when you start the process of creating the DVD that you plan to leave your PC to do its work without any interruptions for a long time. If your using a DVD-9 with most of the space being utilized on the disk expect about 7-8 hrs. Not a joke but the result was definite satisfactory. I can only assume that if you use a DVD-4.7g disk that it would be half that amount of time. What I've done every time is to start the proces of creating just befor I go to bed and all shoud be ready to play in your DVD player in the morning. Good luck.
356	1	I have this product installed on all my computers and unlike McAfee, I never have received a crippling update. Very easy install with Norton 360.
357	1	I have used turbo tax for at least 7-8 years. It has never failed me!! Tempted to try a different tax program each year because the price seems to be increasing, but then I find it for less through Amazon. Easy to use, except for minor glitch transferring it from a computer with internet access to a different computer (without internet for security purposes). Otherwise, very good product when I am getting over double in return than I have ever received.
358	0	Have used Turbo Tax Fed for years satisfactorily. Tried Fed + State E-file for2014. Fed = ok, State not so. Used Alabama state tax forms from web site. Fed refund rapid.
359	0	"(revised from 1 star to 3)<br />This did not work on my Laptop I just purchased.  I had to return the computer since I needed to have 8.1 Pro installed for the hyper v capability.  The message I got when placing the product code for 8.1 pro was that this code does not work with this image or something like that.  Really not sure if it was the laptop fault or the key..... (update: It might have worked for me if the following instructions were more readily visible to me during the install)  Hope this helps others.<br /><br />1.

360	-1	Cannot be downloaded from overseas locations on amazon or on their website.<br /><br />A huge pain for expatriates on top of an already overburdened and unscrupulous tax code.  Seriously nothing with this process is easy for us.
361	1	This is an excellent value if you love Wordperfect, as I do.  It has all the features I need.
362	0	I think it is more expensive than it needs to be. For the last 2 years, I've had weird issues with the software. This year one of the screens was half hidden behind something else and I couldn't read what it said.  Next year I might consider a different brand.
363	0	Product is great. Not sure anyone enjoys paying taxes.
364	-1	Really disappointed by their switch and bait, I have been using Turbo tax basic for years, now I am told I have to upgrade to Premier for an extra $ 70. I returned the program and bought H R Block deluxe.
365	-1	I purchased this product for download and had problems downloading this product.  I contacted Amazon and was told that they do not allow returns on download items but gave me an avenue to the vendor.  I completed the required information about the problem for the vendor and in 10 days, have heard nothing from them.  I am an avid shopper on Amazon and this is the first time that I hae ever had a bad expwerience with one of their vendors.
366	-1	download was ok. that's all that was ok. trying to use, useless, download templates from their site, and it goes nowhere.<br /><br />so now I will do what I should have done and get office 2013.<br /><br />this was a waste of time to me
367	-1	"I got the quicken for MAC 2011 \\""essentials\\"" on the box it's very vague but positive.  Contained no manual.          PC TO MAC IS NOT COMPATIBLE - The import from Mac to PC was dismal, failed 2 of 3 attempts over an hour of frustration.  What did import was dumped into the wrong categories.  From PC export to MAC inport it was unable to keep the balance of any of my accounts (over a 2,000 dollar error) WTF!!!!  Intuit have you ever heard of a check sum?      The MAC version has less than half of the capabilities of the 2007 PC version I need it to replace.  No electronic payment capabilities, no calendar,  no future planning and does not work with Turbo Tax.       Anyone who rates this higher then 1 star:  (a) needs to try a better product  (b) works for Intuit    I absolutely do not recommend this product to anybody.  RIP OFF!!!  Do not buy this.  This is so bad I will keep my slow, out of date, dysfunctional PC just to run PC Quicken.  Thanks for nothing Intuit, had it a day taking it back."
368	1	It would be nice if we could insert documents into the final submission. I had one part that needed a letter. I would have liked to insert the letter into the submitted document rather than having to print and mail my return this year.
369	-1	Would not buy yet...bugs!<br />Update:  Still more of the same.....would not buy this version!<br />Update 6/3/15 - Most bugs I've ever seen in a software package.  Wish I hadn't bought this...hours of restoring lost/corrupted data!  Don't know what to do?  Rating should be -1 star, but 1 star is the lowest rating avaliable.<br /><br />Update 4/11/2016 - I still wish there was a rating of -1. (POS)
370	-1	Found out from my MAC dealer it causes more problems and does not  do anything you couldn't do you self
371	-1	Won't download!
372	1	Avast, unlike other products we all know, does not constantly bug you.  At the same time it does a great job protecting your system.  I also find the installed product upgrade notices, for other apps on your box, helpful.  And I have been doing the computer thing since 1970!
373	-1	Just another way to keep you on the leash from year to year. History ended with 2010. clear, easy to use and create, having customer's need  in mind and then confusion, problem with installation, &#34;improved&#34; features intended for a small group of same minded geeks. Subscription! No. clearly just money making model selling cosmetic changes in the world of appearances. I bought it and IF there is a next time, they have to convince me that they care what I need. Don't waste money! 1 star for the past.
374	-1	The program was not what I wanted.  I wanted something for my desk top use.  The program kept directing me to their online engine to store information.
375	0	Very easy to use, but I had to file in two states because of a work related move and it cost me an additional $42 for another state return. Plus to e-file those state returns was $40...not happy.
376	1	Excelent
377	-1	Try before you buy!!  This program would probably please someone who wants to copy recipes but, unless you love buggy software, better look elsewhere for a dependable screen-capture and video editing program.  This one has all the bells and whistles I woulds want -- IF they worked as intended every time.  I wasted too many hours and too many DVD's, so I gave up and took my loss.  Maybe you'll have better success but I repeat, you'll be smart if you try before you buy.
378	1	Gets bigger every year, but this version does seem to have some nice new features.
379	1	I designed my own house with this software, and we're almost done building it now.  I had no design experience before, so I had to learn everything from scratch, but it was fairly intuitive to learn.  (Disclosure: I'm an I.T. pro by day, so it might be harder for a &#34;regular&#34; user to learn.  I can't say.)<br />The software is really powerful, though. I love the different views you can see.  My house is coming out exactly like it looks on the software, so I can't complain.  :)  It has TONS of awesome features.
380	-1	Have used TurboTax for years. (Since the 90's.) Not at all happy with their new way of only allowing 1 state return for e-filing.  Will no longer be buying this product.
381	0	Not a noticeable difference from Quicken 2013.  The good stuff (most everything) still is good, the bad stuff (feeds from Vanguard which may be Vanguard's issue) are still bad/broken
382	-1	had to work with did not like it the downloading did not go well wish I had saved my money
383	1	Very good
384	1	I thought I would sit down and write a review regarding Quicken Home & Business 2014 now that I've had chance to use it for about six weeks. I've been using Quicken for probably close to 25 years. I used to really look forward to the annual updates but the program became mature in the late 90s. After that, they started forcing you to upgrade every three years to be able to do your electronic transactions. I reluctantly upgraded every three years to keep those features but the program just seemed to get slower and slower over time. As I knew my three years was coming up in March, I bought the program because I saw it at a good price on Amazon and I thought I would wait until March to install it as I figured they would probably get more bugs out of the way.<br /><br />I ended up buying a new computer in December and I thought I would go ahead and install the new version and see how it worked. I had read the reviews on Quicken 2014 and they were mostly bad and I too ran into some problems at first but once I got all the updates in place, and figured out how to run some of the new things, I am pleasantly surprised. This version has the first update in speed that I've seen in 10 years. Entering transactions in some of my investment accounts could take up to 15 seconds in the past and now they are handled in a matter of seconds. Anything that seemed to be slow on my previous versions was operating much faster, including the startup time which is markedly improved. I don't use the mobile features and I don't know how they work but the basic features that I have used over the years are all there and working faster.<br /><br />The biggest problem I am having is interfacing with Quicken online payroll. Instead of doing the one click export as I did on my old computer, I have to use the QIF export which takes quite a few more steps. Considering I only have to do that twice a month, it is a small price to pay. I was really surprised when Intuit payroll support told me that their program won't work on a 64 bit environment. I used it on a 64-bit computer with Windows 7 for years and never had a problem. Now I switch over to Windows 8 on a new computer, and use Quicken 2014, and now I have a problem? In this day and age, I'm really surprised that a company as large as Intuit would not have the interface for their payroll program able to work in a 64-bit environment.  Oh well, I hope they fix that in the future.<br /><br />Online transactions to my bank accounts and stock brokerage firms work well and fast. They seem to work faster than before. I think they did mess up the invoice feature if I remember correctly. I don't use it that often but in the past I was able to create an invoice and then instantly email that to a client. Now I think that you have to create the invoice and save it to a file then email the client and attached the invoice. I hope they get this fixed as that require some extra steps, just like the payroll export feature does. Other than that, I am pleased.<br /><br />Update 2/14/14:  Just updated to R6 the other day and now having problems with Bill and Income reminders.  I clicked on one to pay my office rent and nothing happens.  A couple of them worked and a couple other reminders didn't.  Have NEVER seen this issue in any of the previous updates.  Was hoping that each successive update would solve issues and not introduce new ones.  Hopefully they will have a new update soon that addresses that issue.<br /><br />Update 3/1/14:  Not sure what the problem was after the update because it was only on a couple of entries and then was fine.  I did lose the ability to email invoices through MS Live Mail in the 2014 version update.  The message said that you couldn't use 64-bit Outlook.  I don't even use outlook but it was on my computer.  I uninstalled the 64-bit version of MS Office and re-installed the 32-bit version.  I still don't use Outlook BUT now quicken will use Windows Live Mail (it is my default email client) to send the invoices, just like it did with 2011.  I didn't even set up Outlook but obviously Quicken 2014 looks for the Outlook version before it moves on to Live Mail.  Hope that might help someone as I have seen numerous complaints on the web about this.
385	1	This will be the second year that I have subscribed to Norton 360.  My first year I had Version 4 and this year Version 5.0  I find Norton 360 to be very effective as an anti-virus and computer maintenance program. I switched to Norton after many years of using other anti-virus and internet protection programs.
386	-1	I couldn't get this software to deal with entries on my K-1, and the customer service people answering tax questions argued with me about the rules -- they didn't get it. Customer service is difficult to work with, as the only available commuication is via online chat -- no telephone help.
387	0	it is a little confusing for me, I would like to be able to track my day to day spending and have never figured that out.
388	1	Avast was suggested to me by the independent computer dealer / repair shop that I purchased my Lenovo laptop from. In the past I've tried Norton and McAffee, both of which slowed my PC or Laptop down considerably. To be honest, I was a little skeptical of relying on a &#34;free&#34; Antivirus software, but since it was suggested to me by an expert, I decided to try it.<br /><br />I love Avast. It is great. It is comforting to know Avast is there.....thanks guys.<br /><br />Mike O'Neill
389	-1	"After downloading, the readme file indicated that the key codes for electronic fling would immediately follow and/or be a part of my \\""download package.\\""  I spent some time searching, with no joy.  Add to the cost of the software on Amazon the cost of finding the key codes - or paying for the e-file.  For $5 more, it's probably advisable to download directly from HR Block unless you do not value your own time."
390	1	I have only had this software for about one month but so far it has been very good protection.  I'd like to evaluate it in a year.  I would definitely recommend it,
391	-1	Can those of us who bought the extremely buggy Quicken 2013 get a discount on this version, and does it fix many of the issues that still plague the 2013 version a year after release?
392	-1	Not for me. I was hoping to find something that allowed me to create a simple budget. It had that capability and could've been useful... What I didn't realize was that my bank would charge me a monthly $8 fee for using it. The point of my getting it was to help save money. The monthly fee charged for using it defeats that purpose. I realize this is not the fault of quicken, but it should be disclosed more obviously before you spend the money on the software. It could get expensive if you use more than one bank and are charged multiple fees.
393	0	Illinois state return produced inaccurate returns. Didnt seem to pull the proper information from the Fed return.  Had to scrap it and go on line to the manual form.
394	0	"I am very sorry to see the loss of support for schedule D in the Deluxe edition. I've been using TurboTax every year since 1986. I'm afraid I've finally reached the breaking point and will have to switch products. From my standpoint, TurboTax has been slowly degrading its capability over the years. I know my issues don't affect everyone, but they do affect me:  The latest - loss of Schedule D (all the explanations are really B.S. It is just a price rise.)  Prices jumping significantly with no increase in functionality - especially in times of low inflation.  Earlier - loss of Schedule C (although I no longer use it every year)  Dumbing down the user interface. I used to primarily use Forms view when it gave all the built-in help when needed. Now you pretty much have to use the Q&A view to get help and it's not always immediately obvious what forms are being updated.  Much earlier - loss of ability to enter receipts for the following year as you got them and have them all picked up along with the previous year's tax return when you purchased the new version.    Update 12/29/14: OK, I admit to overreacting a bit. Most of that was the result of the \\""claim\\"" that this wasn't a price hike. I still like TurboTax and have usually rated in 5 stars. I still can't do that this year because of the price hike and the way it was handled. However, at least for this year, the offer of a free upgrade to Premium does cover the pain. So, I'm raising my review from 1 star to 3 stars. I know I'll have to buy Premium next year so I may be disappointed then, but I won't be unpleasantly surprised again. Price hikes do occur, and while I'm never happy, I understand that they do."
395	-1	I purchased this software back in October 2011 and have been having issues with invoices the numbers show up wrong and negative and i have communicated with customer service for the past year. They stated it will be resolved in the next update like a broken record to no avail it has not been fixed yet. I contacted them on August 31 2012 they refuse to let me talk with a supervisor about this continuing issue.  Don't buy this software it is nothing but disappointments. this software should get negative stars you can not run a business with the wrong numbers its a nightmare to keep track of.
396	-1	Thought I was getting their top of the line option but had to buy a $10 add on piece part way through to deal with a very simple calculation.  Felt like a pre-planned way to jack up the price. Have used TT for many years but will look very seriously at options next year.
397	1	Great product that helps keep your pc running at top speed.
398	-1	I bought this software so I could file my small business tax returns. it truns out it's only if you file a schedule C, not for S or C Corps.<br />I would like a refund!
399	1	Easy software to use, download went perfect. I had not used TT for a few years & decided to try it again. I'm a believer now & will be back with TT for 2013!
400	-1	Horrible problems trying to use the State portion. Multiple error codes and no access to help from intuit.
401	0	After installing the download from Amazon and completing the registration requirements I still get a message asking me to register my program. I have done it several times and it still continues to ask me to register. I have sent Norton emails about this situation and have not received any response. Also on a continuing basis there are pop-ups from Norton soliciting further sales of other products. If I had it to do over again I would purchase the Norton product off the shelf with a disc included.
402	1	My brother put Avast into my laptop years ago - and we haven't had a problem since. I've already recommended it to numerous friends.  It's never slowed my computer as other protective programs did.<br /><br />By the way: I'm no young computer whiz - but a Grandma trying to keep up with the new tech. Keeping the computer &#34;clean,&#34; Avast makes using it more enjoyable.<br /><br />Thank you!
403	-1	no info @ all SUCKS
404	0	It is the single best option for capturing video from the major services but still has some big flaws. Must annoying is that when beginning to record a Netflix stream and you have it set to the far more convenient 'auto'  setting, it thinks that you are recording a new program each time Netflix changes the resolution as it rests bandwidth and buffers. For instance, if I begin recording Pretty In Pink, Netflix starts it out at 640x360, then as it spools up to 854x480 and then to 1280x720, Audials will record it as 3 different recordings. If it smells doesn't break it up, you will get dropped frames at each resolution change. There is no adjustment to fix this.<br /><br />Secondly, although the resolution and quality settings are very customizable, recordings use a lot of CPU resources; I would say that they are abnormally high, even considering the use of the x264 encoder. I could literally find no setting of any good quality that would record 720p without making out my AMD x4 955 or FX-6100. Frames rate issues seem to exist here, as judder is nearly inevitable. The only way I have found to get any kind of consistent results is to set the encoder to use the .wmv high quality settings and set it to match the frame rate of the source (which generally seems to be 25 fps). The resulting files are huge, about 8GB per hour. I just reencode them to .mkv or .mp4 with Handbrake. Gives me better results than if I had just captured in this format in the first place. I wouldn't even consider trying to capture in 1080p unless I was running an i5 2500k, Octo-core AMD or i7.<br /><br />I wish that Audials had a queue feature like It's competitor, PlayLater. It allows.you to queue up a couple dozen programs and they just get recorded one after the other. The video quality from Audials CAN definitely be better than Play Later, but when you're just trying to get an entire season of My Little Pony, the queue feature is just a much bigger factor.
405	0	Great functionality overall, with some added perks, but the Identity Safe crashes every three days or so while using Chrome with no apparent workaround on Norton's end.
406	0	Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014 worked as expected but is too expensive in my opinion.
407	1	Protects my system from malware and viruses. with great efficiency.  I would recommend this very highly to anyone looking for an awesome FREE antivirus software.
408	0	Pro: This has a great new graphic interface.<br />Con: Very immature design. The home screen collapses to the top left (its MINIMUM size) every time. Seems like they rushed out a product (or maybe get it right by the next year. Intuit's arrogance is unmatched).<br /><br />I have to recommend it to my clients who need Inventory Assembly, so I am moving this product, but everyone tolerates it only because they have historic data in a prior QB Pro version.<br /><br />And I buy from Amazon because they deliver prices that Intuit's own channels cannot. I am a ProAdvisor whose own discounts cannot match what Amazon offers, so this is the best place to buy this product, hands down. Amazon: A. Intuit: B-
409	0	The reason why we have to file taxes is because of Intuit. They make bank off having people pay for state tax e-filing - even with the title of the software being as it is, it does not include state e-filing. It can do them, and you can print them out, and mail them in, but it's $20 to file state taxes electronically and this goes to Intuit, not the state or federal government.<br /><br />Changing jobs, dumping my 401K after having taken off and not paid back entirely a couple 401K loans, I wanted to make it more painless. It did do that. I'll get this next year as well, but only to compare to what I've done every year - filed them myself...and see if the numbers are different...and WHY.
410	0	H & R Block tax software is no better or no worse than other tax software providers.  None of them cover the subject of oil and mineral royalties very well.  The tax forms provided are confusing and entries are not well explained.  Overall I was disappointed.
411	0	I was very happy with my old version but realize that for security and giving Quicken a new look, time must march on!  I only use Quicken to do my taxes at the end of the year so all the bells and whistles are overkill - that being said, for someone who relies on the program for all their banking, it is probably great!  I upgraded because I was forced to or lose my bank connection.
412	-1	It took too long to download, then once it did, they got me to upgrade.  That got worse. took 7 people to upgraded it and about 11 hours.
413	1	We've used the free version of Avast Antivirus on four different computers for two years. It has warned us about entering questionable websites (we didn't!) and on a couple of instances has removed viruses (how did we get them?) during routine scans. You can't complain about the price.  As a word of warning, I'd suggest you download this program directly from Avast and from no other source, e.g. D***load dot com, where it is likely to be accompanied by -- gasp -- undesirable trashware, trojans, adware, pestware, and other junk that makes its way onto your computer. I'd suggest you google d***load dot com to see what has happened to many (including me) at that site.
414	0	This would be the fifth year I used Turbotax.  But this year, it would not enter the information I had correctly.  As an ordained minister, we are partially employed and partially self-employed, and it would not let me enter the expenses and deductions where needed.  I finally gave up and spent the money on an accountant who specialized in clergy.  He saved me over $3000.  I don't know who re-wrote it, but there is less freedom to pick categories and enter data than I had found previously.  I will not buy it again.<br />Before, I appreciated just entering data and  having someone else do the work. If we had a simple income, I would definitely use it again...so I can't say it is a bad program.  But not for clergy!
415	-1	Not worth the time to download or install it.
416	0	Well written and frequently updated. That has not changed. The front end has become increasingly difficult to tune and navigate, and the pop-up notifications are getting to the point of tedium. The sandbox feature has caused several problems for me on Windoze 7 Professional, and the new feature that gleans what is slowing down your computer gives you no options to review or select what it would do if you ran it. I shudder to think what would happen if I did. Still, a better value than the shrink-wrap junk from Symantec and ilk, but they seemed to have abandoned the happy-go-lucky Eurohacker image for some corporate bucks, and it's to their (and my) detriment.
417	-1	I downloaded the 2013 version and received a message indicating that certain files were corrupt.  I tried once again to download and still couldn't get it to open.  I'll just keep using my 2011 version since many are saying that the updated version is not worth the effort.
418	-1	Like many others have stated, the software requires an update, you update, and again it requires an update. It is an endless loop. What a waste of time and money. I followed all the suggested procedures - run as an administrator, close all virus software, make sure the software is installed on the c-drive. It didn't matter. Prior to giving up on the software, I uninstalled it and then downloaded again. That fixed it.
419	1	We do like the Mc Afee Total Protection 2015, this is the first time to be a Mc Affe user before we had Norton. The Mc Affe is much more user friendly with more features like the parental control.<br />In order to download the Software you must first register to Mc Affe with your code what you have recieved upon buying.<br />So far the program is running fine no PC issues. Our PC is running faster as with Norton, guess we stay mith Mc Affee.
420	1	QuickBooks is trusted name.<br />Followed instructions and download was easy and secure.<br />Followed instructions and Installed.<br />Amazon was easy to use.
421	-1	Poor customer service.  Lengthy time to wait to speak to someone, especially when it informs Turbo Tax being unable to e-file and generates a response to file by mail when the software program tells you it will take 4-6 weeks.  Going on a day on waiting to speak from some one with Turbo Tax.  I you need to speak to a representative, put your life on hold, and be willing to wait of a long time by your computer and phone.  I will not use turbo tax next year.
422	0	buggy
423	0	I love all the reader rabbit products, problem was I paid for this twice (because you have to pay for each computer you download it to) and it wont work on one of the computers I downloaded it to. I think the issue is that this was produced so long ago that it doesn't handle all the new operating systems. When I looked it up it says it runs on Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP. I downloaded it to an older computer (I think XP) and it works most of the time. I downloaded it to a newer computer (windows 8) and it just freezes.
424	0	Turbo Tax becomes less user friendly each year.!  There needs to be a lot of work done on the City Return, i.e CF 1040.  I had to spend hours trying to identify problems with my City return both of the past 2 years.  If I didn't know tax processing as I do, I would have never been able to find the problem.  Accessing tax forms should be easier,  reviewing individual forms is the only way to isolate problems.
425	1	I like everything except that when I try to access my cash account, Quicken crashes. This is quite annoying and renders the application less than satisfactory.
426	1	This download far exceeds my expectations. The approach that Mr. Perry takes with his training has helped me a lot. Prior to watching any of his video training's, I had taught my self basic html, css, and some java script. If I had this type of training with html, css and java scrip, I would be a lot further along with my education. Of course, I am more of a hands on visual type of person. I highly recommend this product if you are the same type too.
427	1	I have had this product before. And like now, it was flawless. Although I must admit, if you're looking for protection that won't slow down your machine - this is not it.<br /><br />That said, Norton has a great product and I have recommended it to all my friends.......and will continue to do so as Norton continues to understand the average user looking to get GOOD protection.
428	1	I still love this program; perfect.
429	-1	Did not work
430	-1	This software should be used as a shining example of what a bad experience can be. I have used this program fully and can truly say I've been had! This program can't keep track of a balance to save its digital life! It's never correct! Never!  Don't waste your money!
431	1	I think quicken is as good as ever, but in a couple of years or less I will be migrating away from windows laptops and going to Android tablet and if quicken has not provided an Android primary app by then I will be switching to the closest one to Quicken that I can run without having to have it on a PC.
432	1	Movavi Screen Capture Studio 4 Personal Edition is a great software program!  I use it to capture specific stills that I want, while reviewing my favorite movies.  The captured pictures turn out fantastic.  I found this software easy to use & I have used it for many purposes, from teaching to my own personal enjoyment.  I highly recommend this software to anyone who wants a terrific screen capture program!
433	1	It works well for me as I only wanted a program to use for balancing my checkbook.  I do not use any of the other capabilities.
434	0	Alright so far. Not as user friendly as a previous version of Printshop I have used, but still learning to navigate this one.  Too early to tell.
435	-1	Only a few different fonts with different sizes and slants.  Does not work with your MS fonts on documents.  I deleted it as soon as I installed it.  Wish I had never purchased it.
436	-1	had to buy upgrade for 1099c.
437	-1	Don't buy this if you intend to download transactions from bank; it does not work!!!
438	1	I know the product is excellent because I've used older versions in the past.  However, after downloading, I was unable to use this program because it only has two fields for bank account access and my bank requires three fields in order to login. Contacted Amazon immediately and was given the Intuit Quicken return website with instructions how to receive a refund, which was credited to my account within the 10 days promised.
439	1	Just got this because I wanted to renew. Just insert the product key and update after for the newest version. Works like a charm !! SAVE a buck or two
440	0	Bought on Amazon when I realized early issues did not include the slow performance complaints noted in 2014 edition and the price dropped to $69.99 for a time.  2015 Premium is better on my 6 year old Lenovo laptop than 2014 ever was.  I experience far fewer screen refreshes than with the 2014 version.  No problems with download, install or passwords and kept multiple passwords.  Rating of 3 stars is because it is still slow on my machine -- better than 2014 but still subjectively one of the slowest software packages I use.
441	-1	can't import QIF files into checking anymore, didn't know that and can't get my money back.From what I read onother post quicken did this to force banks and customers to pay a fee to use QFX files.
442	0	I had one person who found our account when nobody could. Mr. Rossi out of four agent he found it.
443	1	Lightroom is no Cs6 but in a bind it's definitely the next best thing. It's user friendly and a pretty small program for all that it offers.
444	0	I need Microsoft Office for my work teaching online.  Students are required to turn in their papers using Microsoft word or rich text formats, so I need it for grading.  My computer crashed, and came back from the puter doc with a new hard drive, so all programs were gone.  I didn't want to buy new at the local store, so off to Amazon, and got my product for much less, with delivery under a week.  Unbelievable service from wonderful Amazon.    Want to try downloading a free office suite that is offered on the web that promises full compatibility with Microsoft so that I don't have to keep paying the exhorbitant initial price for Microsoft products, and then find I'm tied in to upgrades and additions that are needed to keep the whole package going.  Even with the Amazon discounts, I feel Microsoft is way overpriced for the quality and designs that are offered.
445	1	I have purchased my tax software the past two years from Amazon and find it to be easy and reasonable.  In fact this year I actually ordered the wrong one and they were kind of enough to give me credit towards the correct one.
446	1	good product easy to use
447	1	Except for being waaay over priced I like Outlook. It gives me the control I want to weed out spam and performs well. The only thing I don't like is if my computer crashes or something like that, I loose all the email data that I have save, etc. It is actually my secondary email source. Gmail is my primary where I don't have to concern myself with loosing anything.
448	0	I agree with other reviewers that forcing me to update didn't sit well, but let's face it - there aren't too many programs that you can use forever.<br />After reading all the negative reviews, I did look into other programs, but it seemed like going to Quicken 2013 would be the smoothest transition, and - theoretically - the quickest.  This version is pretty much the same as 2010 so far.  I wasn't too happy when I spent an hour putting information in only to have it tell me that it closed unexpectedly and I might lose all the data.  When I re-opened it, everything was there, though, so that was a needless worry.  I'd say it's as good as any other programs, and Amazon's price can't be beat!
449	0	Hard to accept less options and reports after being a Quicken 2007 mac user. But beats nothing. I'm running both on different machines in order to perserve continuity, especially for the reason that I want a straight across data dump for Turbo Tax.
450	0	I have windows that pop up, and though avast blocks them, there does not seem to be a way to eliminate the threat.
451	0	I was very suspicious of using TurboTax given the other reviews and my own personal history with them last year.  I barely like this company after using them for several years.<br /><br />However, Amazon has always provided good customer service so I took a risk.<br /><br />Last updated:  20 January 14<br /><br />The software downloaded fine and installed without a single issue on my Windows 8 machine (8.1 software OS) and I've started using it.<br /><br />My first issue is that it didn't find its own PDF of my TurboTax tax return from last year.  This was my exported PDF tax return from TurboTax last year.  You know, my copy of what they submitted to the IRS?<br /><br />Right...<br /><br />So I went to manually locate it and got this:<br /><br />&#34;Make sure you are uploading a PDF of your tax return from last year [so far so good] from H&R Block at Home (!!!) or from TaxACT (!!!).  If that doesn't work, don't worry.  We'll help you enter your info manually so you can keep working on your taxes.&#34;<br /><br />Annoying.  I have the standard IRS formatted PDF.  I upgraded my PC - I'm not keeping the stupid turbotax file, I'm keeping the legal document that was submitted.  This program should be able to recognize that format.  It is the, after all, the US Government document.  Ain't no weird margins in my copy alone.
452	-1	this item would not download. iam out $21.35
453	1	So many retirement calculators focus on one product, your 401K for example - very few show the total of several streams of income. This product not only did that but showed me AFTER TAX values of disposable income. This product is very helpful in helping the user decide what date it would be feasible to retire. I highly recommend this product.
454	1	Have been with norton for many years. I have never had a virus that shut me down.
455	0	Not many choices for Mac in this category. Performance is slow. Interface seems blocky. Seems to get everything done that I need, though.
456	1	Purchased Turbo Tax DeLuxe to do my taxes. When I got to where I purchased a new home and sold the old one it wanted an additional $30.00 to complete the return. I feel I got ripped off by Turbo Tax.<br /><br />Lester Williams<br />les1240@aol.com
457	-1	To start off, I have windows 8.1 pro and a very high end laptop. I read through other reviews that said that the program would run on windows 8.1 so I decided to give it a try. Well, come to find out I should have listened to the other 1 star reviewers instead of taking a chance on this! Within 2 hours of downloading this program my computer froze up and had to be restored from a backup, so I lost a lot of information from my computer. Needless to say I'm dissatisfied with this product! I bought it to teach someone to type properly, however, it turned out to be a nightmare instead. I'd stay far away from this one were I give a second chance. Waste of $15!!!
458	1	Better than most products that you have to pay for, because you can perform a boot scan!!
459	-1	can't use win 8.1, must have win 8.0 on  computer.  bought product down load can't install product key win 8.1, running win vista should i trade product key for win 8.0
460	-1	Purchased the QuickBooks Simple Start for Mac for $49 on Saturday, Jan 21st. When I entered the license numbers provided by Amazon, I rec'd an error message and was told to contact Intuit. When I called Intuit this morning they explained that Amazon was offering license numbers for a product underpriced. They refused to give me license numbers for the product, instead offered an email to help with the refund from Amazon and tried to sell me the same product for $12.95 a month, (basically twice what Amazon listed). This is a clear bait and switch and I will NEVER buy software from Amazon again. I would like an immediate full refund.
461	0	There is very little change from prior versions except cosmetics. This is both good and bad, as I was hoping for free syncing with my bank like quicken. But I also saw no need for other changes, so am glad the things that work well are unchanged.
462	1	Awesome product
463	0	I've used this software for years and the biggest plus is that it works and covers most situations that might be encountered for typical middle class users. Since it is The Standard, it might be useful to focus on the areas where it needs improvement. First and foremost, I object to having to purchase a new program every year. Why not have software that is update-able annually for a modest fee? Sure, the tax code changes but other software manages to function with updates. Secondly, why is Intuit stingy about State filings? You get one, if you pay for it but what if your family, like mine needs to file more than one State return? Third, if you have a lot of charitable contributions it is a real pain to get them all in there in a manner appropriate for the IRS. This is not strictly-speaking a problem with Intuit but as a company that promises ease-of-use I would expect them to come up with easier solutions to help out their loyal customers. I'm sure I will buy TurboTax next year, but these are ongoing grumbles from my perspective.
464	-1	I went on line this afternoon to get a copy of TT, it is tax season.  I have used, I guess, the Premier edition for several years with dividends, stock sales etc and I did not have any issues until I got audited for my 2012 returns.  I was able to talk the auditor through the issue over the phone so it was no big deal but a statement from the friendly IRS saying I owed $30,000 plus late fees plus penalties got my attention.  I can't for sure say it was a TT issue but yikes!  As a combination of the reviews and recommendations of a couple of friends, I am going to try HR Block this year.  Turbo Tax, you lose another customer.  I was a click or two away from purchase.  Glad I read the reviews.  Had to 'vote with my feet'.
465	-1	1) Does not completely handle K-1 forms<br />2) Does not allow importing from Wells Fargo Brokerage<br />3) Found several significant errors when program incorrectly used imported 2012 Turbo Tax data<br /><br />From what I had read online, I thought H&R Block would completely handle K-1 forms (importing and data).  It does not.  I wasted my money on this purchase and went back to Turbo Tax to complete and submit my taxes.
466	0	The software doesn't specify clearly on the e-file for the state tax. The software clearly specifies that the MA requires e-file for the state business tax. However, It doesn't provide that capability.<br /><br />It is very confusing. It should have specified clearly that there is no support for business state tax e-file
467	0	you have to download the program from a disk because you cannot save your addresses if you don't. I have been trying to get Amazon to respond for over 1 hr. the software is no good if you can't save your addresse.
468	1	It did what is was supposed to do and helped me get a great tax refund. Reasonably priced and will order again.
469	1	thanks so much for the great product! would definitely buy this again for sure! thanks for everything! strongly recommend. yay!
470	1	FINALLY Microsoft got it right.  Easily reads and plays all my 1997 PowerPoint presentations- unlike the (unnecessary) incompatibilities with PowerPoint 2007 (never tried 2010 since 2007 was so bad)
471	1	Works fine for me.<br />But like most Adobe software, it's a hog.<br />Not so much a problem with today's humungous hard drives and generous RAM.<br />Does everything I need from a Post Processing standpoint. Which is minimal. YMMV.
472	-1	it takes some time but works and price is right have patence takes some time to boot and makes you write  a certain amount to rate
473	0	I personally found it difficult to go through finding it and then going through the procedures to get it to operate.<br />I am not a computer wizard.
474	-1	Not much to it.
475	1	Haven't had a virus since I started using it.It seems to work very well
476	1	I think Quicken is the best product out there for handling financial concerns. I have been using Quicken since the days of DOS.
477	1	You will love the peace of mind it gives you being able to quickly check in on your home when you are away.
478	0	Quicken seems to be the de facto standard for home and small business'. It works well but in my opinion lacks easily customization
479	0	Didn't have the working files
480	0	I really enjoy the convience of shopping online at Amazon.  The softword download is so quick.  The MICR0SOFT OFFICE product is the same high quality intuitive software that I evaluated in the early 1990s.  I have a major problem with Outlook 2010.  the software doesnot work ATT.NET mail.  I spent numerous hours online researching for posssible fixes.  ATT says they do not support anything but Internet mail.  I am sure that OUTLOOK works on other mail servers just find. [[ASIN:B004E9SKF0 Microsoft Office Home & Business 2010 - 1 User-2 PC [Download]]]
481	1	Saves a lot over tax preparers.
482	1	What can we say.  Quicken rocks, now and all years previously.  I use it for my personal checking.
483	-1	The Worst Application And Money That I've Spent A While! The software did not work as advertised and I was not able to return it because of Amazon's download process! Very very disappointed avoid downloading things from Amazon especially computer applications and for you cannot return them!
484	-1	Really, how many yrs and how many thousands of EV vehicles were sold and H&R Block Head chooses not to support the tax credt?  I have used their software for close to 10 yrs, no more, It's Turbo Tax for me since they support the credit.<br />Shame on you H&R Block Head for not supporting such a credt
485	1	Super good protection.work perfect for my windows 8.
486	0	The software is pretty much the same as the previous years.
487	-1	I have previously used TurboTax for simple tax returns for several years without too much issue.  However, starting in tax year 2012, I ran into an issue filing my state return, which required me to speak with a customer service representative.  Essentially, I had earned income in the state of Minnesota and needed to file a return.  Unfortunately, the Minnesota Department of Revenue stopped accepting returns from TurboTax that year due to problems with the electronic submissions.  At that point, I called Intuit to speak with a customer service representative to resolve the issue.  The first representative I spoke with denied that there was a problem and requested weblinks to the Minnesota Department of Revenue and the StarTribune articles I referenced during my call.  Once he verified the issue, he transferred me to another representative who stated that I should file anyway, despite the fact that Minnesota was not accepting returns.  This rep told me that he couldn't guarantee acceptance of the return, but was 'fairly certain' it would eventually go through.  After asserting I was not comfortable without a guarantee, I requested a refund my filing with the state of MN only (mind you not for my federal and other state returns).  I was told this was not possible, despite not being able to guarantee a successful return.  When I asked to speak with a manager, I was informed that a manager had been listening to the call for the last several minutes and also stated that I would not get a refund.  Despite repeated requests to speak with this manager, I was informed that this was possible due to the call volume.  Essentially, my patronage to Intuit was deemed worthless.<br /><br />So this year, I got a nice deal on the 2014 software and decided to give TurboTax one more go around.  And, voila...MN again is putting a halt to TurboTax returns.  I don't dare waste me time with customer service again this year.  I'll consider it a lesson learned and give other software a try.
488	0	It's still broken. Immediately EXITS when you try to synchronize it with any of the financial institutions. None of the &#34;fixes&#34; on the forum works either... not real happy about this but it's not a show-stopper...
489	0	Quicken 2015 is better than Essentials, but still not as good as the Windows version. Not sure why, but the Mac version has less functionality. Reconciliation and acct to acct transfers initiated within Quicken for the Mac either don't exist or are inferior.
490	-1	Pointless to buy the program
491	1	I have been using this software for years never had an issue.
492	-1	Do not waste your time or money as I have. I have found and used with success a better less expensive program.<br />Customer service is poor at best, I contacted them they gave me an incident # AND THAT IS THE LAST I HEARD FROM THEM.<br />Countless emails not ONE reply.<br />Wish there was negative stars or 0 stars I hate even giving them one star.<br />Stay away, Save your money.
493	0	I tried Qmac 2015 as a substitute for QWin 2012 for 2 reasons.  I'm primarily a Mac user and only use Windows via VMWare for QWin 2012, so fully ditching Windows would eliminate one OS to maintain.  Also, QWin 2012's ability to download transactions stops on 4/30/2015 and QWin 2015 will not work on XP, so a newer Windows OS would be needed.  Continued maintenance of another OS and additional cost were reasons to see if QMac 2015 would do the job for me.<br /><br />It is different from the Windows versions, but I was able to get by them to make it do what I needed (bank and investment account monitoring and balancing).  However, I got stuck in the squeeze of the limited connection methods employed by QMac 2015 and American Funds inability or choice not to work with them.  That broke the deal for me.<br /><br />A couple notes on the Amazon refund process with Intuit.  I followed their instructions to send a request to ereturns@intuit.com.  I received no feedback from anyone, either on the receipt of my request or on its being processed.  A chat session with a support staffer showed me there is little knowledge, or access to same, on the Amazon-purchase refund process.  I did get the refund the day after the chat session (about 2 weeks after the request) and am conversing with Quicken support on how they can improve the process.
494	1	I upgrade about every 2 years and I love the improvements and the new remote features.  I purchased this one to pass the torch to my now adult son and have been teaching him how to use it to manage his budgets and assets.  He is amazed and loves it.
495	-1	ok
496	1	First off I want to thank Chief Architect for their customer service. I purchased Home Designer Architectural 2014 and a few weeks later the newer and shinier 2015 version shipped. I contacted customer service (talked with sales actually) and they offered me the 2015 version for just the difference in price between the old and new versions. Kudos to Chief Architect for taking care of their customers<br /><br />I'm no expert with home design software and have only used home design software in the past for simple projects and for trying out different ideas. The wife and I are looking to build a house and we purchased this software based on good reviews and the tons of tutorials available.And while we are not attempting to produce the final engineering drawings, we will leave that to experts, we want to get a good idea of what works for us and what doesn't.<br /><br />Home Designer Architectural 2015 is similar to other home designer packages in that there is a simple up front wizard to help design the basic layout of your dream home. The nice thing is you can create a basic plan with the wizard with all your preferred room dimensions and save it. Then you can come back and rearrange the layout as many ways as you want without having to redo the rooms again. you can generate floor plans from those different versions of room arraignments and see which you like better. One negative on the design wizard is that you are stuck with the default labels and limited number of rooms available to choose from. If you delete the default room label you also lose the room dimensions and if you add your own text box it does not stick with the room when you rearrange them. It would be nice to be able to change room labels in the wizard to names that are meaningful to the people designing the house and have the labels stick with the room through the floor plan generation . It is a pain to have three different family rooms when all you wanted was an couple of extra rooms to resize.<br /><br />After that you need to spend some time with the documentation and the tutorials to learn how to alter the floor plan that gets generated. If you do not take the time to learn the software you will be in for an extremely frustrating time using this or any other design software. Jumping back and forth between the layout view and the rendered 3d view is very helpful in seeing how your changes to doors or windows placement for example impacts the rooms and whatever grand plans you have for that room or rooms. I'm am still learning the software and will admit that I have had several frustrating times trying to get some idea or change to happen as I want it. One of the most infuriating issues for me, and this is not limited to Chief Architect software, is the clumsy and way too complicated method of creating a cabinet for built-in appliances. Building separate cabinets and stacking them together sounds and looks simple enough on the tutorials but stacking them up, aligning them and making changes to one and not putting the other cabinets out of whack is something that eludes me at the moment. Again this is not point and click software you need to learn the software.<br /><br />PROS: very powerful software, is pretty snappy on my old Intel core 2 duo E8400 CPU with 8GB of ram, lots of support and tutorials<br /><br />CONS: Expensive - if you don't think you can buckle down and take the time to learn the software don't spend the money, designing cabinets for built-ins is a pain, design wizard has limited number of rooms and room labels cannot be changed.<br /><br />All in all I'm am happy with the software so far, even though I find myself cussing at the screen at times, and hope to get a better handle on it as I continue to work with it.
497	0	Love TurboTax after doing my taxes by hand for years.  Not at all impressed by the additional charges and lack of guidance (which I enjoyed for my own tax return) for my daughter's state(s) return which included out-of-state work study earnings (college work-study.,,,,this shouldn't be difficult), which led to 2 state returns, and in the end we abandoned turbotax and did it the old-fashioned way.  By hand.  Advice...do NOT spend the extra bucks for multi-state returns.  Free forms are available on-line!
498	-1	"After using online the past few years, and finding this year they wanted an extra $35 just for state e-file, I found this on Amazon to be an acceptable deal. It says very clearly provides both Federal and State return filing.<br /><br />However, this only includes filling out the forms for you, as e-filing (who wouldn't want to e-file?) costs (on top of the price you pay above) another $19.95! For the \\""convenience\\"" of them sending the digital forms along instead of you printing and mailing them.<br /><br />Very lame.<br /><br />I should also note that they say you can import last years information but ONLY if you had the same OS software program, and you cannot use online information. It requires a .T12 file type to attempt import.<br /><br />So if you want to avoid paying double for the option of e-filing your state return stay away!"
499	1	I had originally gotten the home/student edition of Office along with a stand alone Outlook but the pricing for this one product which had everything I need was a better deal.
500	0	do NOT use the disc, it will give U nothing but troubles. get the licence and DOWNLOAD software, WARNING: Once U buy it... Do not waste ur time trying to contact support, U will not b able to contact them either by email or chat...
501	0	could be a little easier to use
502	1	I stopped using Turbo Tax 10+ years ago when they went through the phase of installing spyware in order to activate the product.  On a whim I tried it this year and am glad to have switched back.  After using a less expensive product for many years, I am amazed at what I have been missing.  I have a very complex filing with multiple income streams, investments, HSA, charitable deductions - you name it. I did not have any glitches.  My old program was constantly not guiding me through everything and I was forced to review line by line to see if everything was complete.  Turbo Tax is much more helpful.  I really like the 'audit gauge' - for what it's worth.  Glad to be back.
503	1	very helpful
504	1	I switched to H&R Block Deluxe after Intuit tried their price gouging routine and then were disingenuous about the reason for the price increase. While the H&R block interface is not quite as easy to use as Turbotax, the software did the job at half the price. After my positive experience with H&R Block, I plan to use the software in the future.
505	0	I wish I didn't get this don't get it it will hurt your computer.ask a pro be for use this
506	1	I have used H&R Block tax software for several years now and it is easy to use and they are very helpful if you need to talk to a real person for advice.
507	0	I had problems downloading software with AVG on a VISTA computer.  It turns out that the anti virus things that all of the downloads are anti viruses.  There is a setting in the registry which disallow checking downloaded files via anti virus.<br />reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments /t REG_DWORD /v ScanWithAntiVirus /d 1 /f
508	0	I changed back to my Turbo Tax. It is more understandable and not so tedious. I did use it in 2009 though.
509	1	Perfect as always
510	1	I have used H&R Block Tax Software for years and just love I. The online and phone help is fantastic.
511	-1	I am so done with Microsoft-anything. They nickel and dime the hell out of their consumers. I feel so taken. I spent $100 and now discover I will be forced to spend $100 every year to keep this garbage, something I get from Google docs for free. What a load of BS. And, this new version is more time and work than it is worth. I want it off my computer but now I am stuck with it. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame in me. Nice try Microsoft. The will not be a twice.
512	0	Works well on my windows 7 pro computer. I wanted to install it on my old computer with Dial-up service.  It does not work with dial-up.  This should be noted on the ordering page.
513	0	I dont have a huge amount of time to write up, but wanted to get a few words out there. The update is nice with some smoother functions/ views. Budgeting really sucks and I get much better and smoother results with a separate Excel spreadsheet. Next, and this has been a problem for YEARS, is that there is not a simple option to include future CC charges in the IN/OUT/WHAT's LEFT views.<br /><br />For example, we charge EVERYTHING on CC to get points and don't pay interest (usually). Anything scheduled on a CC does not show up. I can see going either way, depending on your personal budget and financial philosophy, but stupid that it is locked out.<br /><br />As for the mobile app. It's OK. What I really hate is that you can not see scheduled events in the mobile app. So, if you typically charge $50 a week in gas on CC 1, you can not pull that up on the app and apply it. HUGE shortfall on Inuits side. Lastly, sync is PAINFULLY slow.<br /><br />The rest, of the app and main product is nice.
514	-1	One of the worst purchases I have ever made on Amazon.  It not only will not end your pop ups and malware but now most of what I am getting is coming from this software.  Total waste of money DO NOT BUY!!!
515	-1	Is  there a way to import data from an existing spreadsheet or copy and paste into the checkbook? If not, this is basically useless.
516	-1	I bought this because the description made me think I would be able to create birthday cards.  However, after receiving it I found that it was not good for that.  I ended up buying a regular card making program directly from Serif.  At least PagePlus Essentials only cost me $1.99.
517	1	Got the code near instantly and was able to upgrade the computer. Beware if you order more than one, you may get flagged like I did for verification but only took a couple of hours.
518	1	Have been using it for about 6 years now. Started when I installed it in a business environment for my clients, now I use it for personal use as well.  It's free, it does a wonderful job at keeping your computer virus free, and is very light on system resources compared to other A/V programs.  What's not to like?<br /><br />However, it doesn't protect from some malware or spyware programs, so if you want protection for those as well, either purchase the full (internet security or other), or compliment this program with another like malwarebytes' anti malware.<br /><br />Either way, it's a great choice!
519	1	If you don't want to wait for your item to be mailed, I recommend this service.<br />I was up and running in no time at all. The download was fast accurate and had no flaws.<br />The best of all is if I have any issues with the application I have a hard copy backup created after download.<br /><br />I would recommend this service to all interested!
520	1	Excellent
521	-1	It couldn't be downloaded & the Microsft customer support staff were unhelpful.
522	-1	Very Slow and the speed up setting does not work. Just does not work as advertised. As far as I am concerned I just wasted what I paid for it.
523	-1	This is an OK program for the price. Its good for basic photo editing. That being said, this organizational aspects are great. Overall, I would recommend spending the money on CS6.
524	0	ITS A OLD PRODUCT! YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET! BUT IL FIGURE IT OUT FOR THE PRICE! I NO
525	-1	Having a hard time getting things to download from my bank accounts, etc.  A little too complicated for me it seems.  Going back to old Microsoft Money even if it is 2004 Edition!
526	-1	I stayed up to work on a research paper. This software is the worst I have ever used. It would not let me delete or add text to certain lines, and when I would try to type a letter it would type but it would be the wrong information. I made comments and part of the words in the comments box was cut off. This is the worst software I have ever used. I am surprised and because it is not a good tool to use, I had to go ahead and purchase MS Word 2010. I thought 2013 would be great, but it is not. PLEASE, don't waste your money! Maybe the company will fix the glitches in the future, bit it is horrible. I waste time today because of it.
527	-1	"I have purchased this product the last 4 years however, this year is my last.  I completed my daughters returns and got to the accuracy check which indicated an error with her child care provider. It would not let us make a correction.  Called customer support and was told it was a known issue that if you imported last years info there was a flaw and would have to do manual without import.  That did not work either.  The flaw apparently will not be fixed until next year;  Spent at least 2 hours trying to fix this and would not have wasted time if the manual process would not work either.  Went to Turbo Tax free online and everything worked fine and her returns have both been accepted.  Then I prepared my return and submitted.  My federal was accepted but state was rejected.  The message from H&R Block was it was rejected and I would have to file a paper return.  No explanation given for the error although there was an error code in the message.  Called customer support again and was told the code was for an SSN problem.  I asked if the info was imported from the fed return why the ssn would be wrong in state.  No explanation just that it was a problem.  Their customer service was worthless and the program is as well.  You would think since they provide software updates they could have fixed the child care issue.  Of course other than the \\""customer service\\"" reps there is no way to register a complaint.  I am still looking for a number or email.  I will be sharing this on the web as well."
528	-1	I wish I never heard of Apache OpenOffice. The main problem is that it continuously scrambles all of the formatting. I spent more time fixing the same formatting issues over and over than I did actually working on the project.
529	-1	"If you plan on filing as a part-year resident in any state, be very careful. Only after downloading and paying for the software, it told me that the \\""District of Columbia program does not support returns for part-year residents in 2010. You'll need to complete your return manually, using forms you obtain from your state\\"", which is ironic because I bought this program to avoid completing my tax return manually! Seems like something H&R Block should advise their customers of before purchase. H&R Block refused to help me with this problem or give me any guidance whatsoever.    Instructions can also be difficult to figure out at times. H&R Block 2009 was unclear and nearly cost me a huge tax credit last year (thank you, Turbotax). All-in-all, be careful in buying this product."
530	1	This program excels at cataloging and managing a big collection of photos. It does a good job at processing the photos, but it seems like I need to go back over troublesome cases with the Gimp, because some problems Lightroom just seems unable to deal with. On the other hand, it is much faster than the Gimp for going through and fixing a multitude of photos, and does things that the Gimp doesn't deal with. The real issue is that there is no manual or help system worth anything. To do this program justice, you need to spend another $50 on a book.
531	-1	State won't load.  It's telling me that I don't qualify for the child care tax credit because I didn't have any income, even though I've already entered my income from my w-2.  I used H&R last year - should have stuck with that!!
532	0	Since buying this for the other PC's in the house I have made the dive into a MacBook Pro.  Bye-bye Windows - won't be needing this type of product anymore - I am an Apple convert all the way now.  But this is the one to buy for your PC although it could be better at containment on one stubborn bug I picked up and had to use Kaspersky to find and kill it - Norton kept missing it.  Most of the PC-mags like it too as it represents the best overall internet security suite out there.
533	0	This product is quirky. Overall does a decent job, but not polished at all. Considering a full blown accounting solution.
534	-1	Very disappointed.  Microsoft Money was such a better product and much easier to use, but no longer supported.  Switched to Quicken Starter Edition 2013 a year ago and have been struggling with the memorized categories, which doesn't work very consistently.  Wanted to upgrade to the latest version, but Starter Edition 2015 does not allow you to import from previous versions (check the disclaimer on Intuit's website before you buy &#34;Upgraders: Does Not transfer data from previous Quicken versions&#34;).  You have to buy the more expensive product if you want to import existing data or start from scratch, which makes this product worthless.  Looking for alternatives to Intuit; a product that will support its uses into the future.
535	-1	As some other reviewers here have said, you get what you pay for. If you are too broke to pay for MS Office, this is an alternative that goes beyond WordPad. You can do page numbering, tables, calculations, convert things to PDF, etc. However, do not expect to have an easy time of it if you have serious academic or business to accomplish. The following are some low points of my personal experience:<br /><br />* Spell checking is difficult to implement in one language, and God help you if you need more than one language. It's doable, but expect to make a several hour project of getting the spell checker to work. Then, when you upgrade, there is a good chance that you will have to redo all the dictionaries from the start.<br /><br />* If your document requires the use of multiple sections, you will have a terrible time getting things like your headers and footers to work. Then, even if everything is fine, or if you import a Word doc with multiple sections, expect the formatting to be violently screwed up every single time you reopen the document.<br /><br />* The styles are very different from Word, but as long as you only have one section in your document, they are workable. However, resetting the default Normal style will not be fun at all.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this free, open source project, but these are among some major flaws that are not going to be fixed any time soon. Somebody needs to take the source code, start a company with things like project managers and QA, and fix it radically.
536	0	I tried the open-source Inkscape before buying DrawPlus X6. Inkscape's interface is a mess, and it can't open EPS files, which is a necessity for me. (As for Illustrator, it's too bad my old Illustrator 8.0 won't install under Win7 -- I can't justify $699 for CS6 or the subscription model of CC.) DrawPlus is fine on drawing tools, but its text-handling tools are terrible -- less flexible, in fact, than what you find in Word. I can't, for example, figure out a way to do manual pair kerning, baseline adjustment, or any of the other similar manipulations one would expect from an illustration program. What's really weird is that DrawPlus includes a tool for entering text in large blocks, but then lacks anything but the most basic controls over the text's appearance.<br /><br />So, if you're going to set all your type in another program and need only a vector editor, I guess DrawPlus will work. But, if that's the case, give Inkscape a try and save yourself the money.
537	0	I miss the payments that I have set up for automatic pay being entered into the register automatically.  I liked the double line register as well, other than that I like it, like the mobile as well.
538	0	"Everything went smoothly with DSL download and installation.  But running Family Tree Maker for the first time, the program insists I perform an immediate REQUIRED UPDATE.  Repeated attempts to run the required update all resulted in RTPatch Error and there seems no solution.    SOLUTION: IF you get a RTPatch Error, run FTM.exe again and CANCEL when you get the warning about required update.  The program runs just fine but you receive a warning that you will not be able to sync your tree with Ancestry.com.  The warning is UNTRUE.  I had no trouble uploading my tree to Ancestry.com    I DID get the 3-month free Ancestry.com subscription for United States data which is worth more than what I paid for FTM 2014 Deluxe digital download from Amazon.  (Since my purchase, Amazon has raised the price and I'm not sure how much Ancestry.com time is included now.)    Since FTM 2014 was released in August 2013, there is NO REASON for this kind of installation gymnastics and untrue warnings.  As a result, my opinion of Ancestry.com and Avanquest North America Inc. is about 3 on a scale of 1 to 10.    My opinion of the Amazon download is about 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.  With Amazon's influence on the marketplace, I see no reason for Amazon to allow Ancestry and Avanquest to sell software that doesn't install properly.    SHAPE UP, AMAZON !    p.s.  I think Ancestry, Avanquest and Amazon should all provide me with a reward for providing an easy to find solution.    IF AMAZON will allow it, I will provide updates on my experience with the Family Tree Maker Deluxe that I recently purchased.    UPDATE: 24 Sept 2014  My newly purchased, downloaded and installed Family Tree Maker has STOPPED RESPONDING several times but would recover after a few minutes.  This morning, FTM CRASHED and I lost about an hour of changes since my last backup.    BACKUP often - it's just a few keystrokes and only takes a few seconds.  Again BACKUP OFTEN !    I'm not sure if the CRASH is because of my particular configuration OR that I could not do the \\""REQUIRED UPDATE\\"" OR if it is related to the tree being synced to Ancestry.    In any case, the FTM software IS BUGGY and you could LOSE DATA so BACKUP OFTEN.    Hey, AMAZON: If you're reading this, why don't you threaten to STOP SELLING all Ancestry and Avanquest until they clean up their software.      Hey,ANCESTRY: You rake in more than enough money to get and retain top-notch software staff, give them great working conditions plus enough compensation and benefits to polish the FTM t*rd into a diamond."
539	1	This program was easy to install and is easy to use for me, especially learning a new program. Glad I got this.
540	0	To many pop ups
541	1	"I have been a quicken user since 1995 and have gone through numerous upgrades and all they entail.  I have always been a big fan of quicken and have come to expect seamless and easy transitions from one version to the next.  Transitioning from Q10 to Q13 brought one major disappointment so far in that my laboriously created 2013 personal budget did not transition without some strange errors.  It was relatively easy to see what was wrong with the new budget presentation layout.  Some expense categories had been moved to the Income Group of categories and all categories in the income group had been arbitrarily divided into two separate income groups, one labeled \\""income\\"" and the other labeled \\""personal income\\"".  And, these two groups were separated in the budget presentation by the expense group!  It was difficult to correct this as the system would not let me do the obvious \\""fix\\"" which would be to move the incorrectly grouped category back to expenses and put all the income categories together in one group.  Happily, I stumbled across an indirect solution that appears to have fixed everything.  In summary, I'm a long time user whose faith has been somewhat shaken by a flawed transition to the upgrade version.  Hopefully, there will be no more gremlins still to come to the surface as I'm only about three weeks into Q13."
542	0	Lots of bugs; not much more than a glorified beta release.  Buy now if you must (sync with iPhone app is pretty good), but buy later if you can.
543	1	I always buy Norton for my home PC.  Our office uses McAfee, but I prefer Norton.
544	-1	"I have a narrow use case.  I bought this desktop-version after the online-version recommended it because of my status as a Registered Domestic Partner in CA.  The RDP section consists of a series of boxes for you to input your own pre-calculated community property additions and subtractions.  The product claims that, due to differences in state handling of community property, it can't assist you. This was unexpected since Deluxe is supposed to include state functionality.  There is also a walkthrough of the community property worksheet, Form 8958, but the wizard forces you to use values off your 1040 for some fields preventing the appropriate splitting of the values as required by CA.  It makes up for this by adding your pre-calculated addition/subtraction in the \\""Other items\\"" section (section 12).  Furthermore, aside from importing (and forcing some) values, the 8958 is disconnected from the rest of the federal tax wizard.  If you make changes, you'll have to make them in the federal wizard and in your 8958.  Worse yet, the additions and subtractions you enter in the RDP section alter the values that appear earlier in the federal wizard which can be confusing if you're reviewing the wizard (rather than the straight forms).<br /><br />The product works fine for the mock joint federal and joint state returns.  As others have mentioned, be aware that your \\""+ State\\"" functionality does not include e-file which costs an additional $20.<br /><br />I'd advise against buying the product if you're looking for RDP support, it's just not there.  Do the paper forms yourself or consult a tax professional."
545	-1	Just purchased Quicken Premier 2015 from Intuit.  Paid a premium for that mistake.  I have used Quicken since it was launched, and I upgrade every other year.  After installing Quicken 2015, the software updated my data file - no apparent problem.  When I tried to update my accounts, Quicken failed on 5 accounts that used to update in Quicken 2013.  When I tried to update a single account - my credit union checking account -- the program froze.  I had to used Windows Task Manager to kill the application and regain control of my window.  I recommend staying with your old version until Intuit works out the bugs in Quicken Premier 2015.  I am extremely dissatisfied with Quicken 2015.
546	0	I am not a bookkeeper, neither do I like bookkeeping. I do however have my own business, and therefore I use quickbooks. I find a lot of areas where it could be more user friendly ... for example: when you search for a client, you have to know the full name, or at least the beginning of it. Exapmple:  Dr Luis Smith. Searching Dr Smith won't find him, neither will Luis Smith, Nor L Smith. Where any one part of the title should bring it up. When you put in an amount: If you forget decimal point, quickbooks will make $3456 instead of $34.56. An auto decimal is so needed. These are little things that irritate me, but then that's how it is. I will be opening another business soon, and hopefully I will use QB for it. There are times that a window pops up, and you have to make a choice on it, but your real choice is not available ...???
547	0	In the early days (mid 90s) there was &#34;Managing your Money&#34; and then &#34;Microsoft Money&#34;. Now there is only one came in town: Quicken.<br /><br />This program does have a lot of power an features, but it is still clunky and buggy when it comes to connecting to banks. Intuit insists on changing the interface format to force user upgrades (and new dollar revenue generation for Intuit) every 3 years. Every time I upgrade I think &#34;wouldn't it be nice if they finally fix the connectivity problems with banks and stop the system crashes&#34;. Every time I am disappointed.<br /><br />Aside from the crashes, there are numerous connectivity issues with banks, most probably caused by the bank, not Intuit. Bank of America is particularly troublesome, and since I have a lot of accounts, I often must disconnect and reconnect and link a number of accounts to fix the problem (happens 6-10 times per year). Sometimes this causes duplicate transactions that I have to manually clean up. Takes about an hour of my time each time it happens.<br /><br />Quicken crashes on me one or two times a day, usually just after I've tried to update my transactions using the account update function.<br /><br />I do like the automatic categorization of transactions and the quick entry assistance. The program also has some good tools for budgeting and tracking of finances.<br /><br />The automatic entry of transactions saves time, but I still like to check off my receipts against the electronic downloaded transactions. In the default mode, this is impossible, but if you turn off automatic memorization &#34;Edit/Preferences.../Register/Data Fill and Quick Entry&#34; then uncheck the &#34;Automatically memorize new payees&#34; check box, you can enter a &#34;v&#34; in the tag field (for &#34;verified&#34;). Statements generally self-reconcile, but the &#34;v&#34; tag field lets me know any transactions that I did not personally verify from a physical receipt for further research.<br /><br />You would think that at some point, they would getthe bank connectivity and crashing problems fixed, but I guess this is just a terminally complicated piece of software. Competition would be great, but Intuit appears to have a monopoly in arranging connectivity with financial institutions.<br /><br />And yes, Kathryn (the personality that responds to negative reviews on behalf of Intuit), please let me know when your team of crackerjack programmers finally releases a stable program (I've been waiting over 6 years now).
548	1	I chose this rating because this product absolutely gives a 5 star performance for me.<br /><br />What I like is the control it gives me over the security of my computer, and its 100% track record of keeping my computer virus-free.<br /><br />I recommend this product to everyone !<br /><br />KPR.
549	1	I LOVE PE12! I have been working with a super old version of Elements and this upgrade was amazing AND affordable. It's just as easy to use as the older versions, but with many more options to truly make your pictures better.
550	1	For the first time ever I had problems downloading updates to an H&R Block software.  It was frustrating and I spent too much time on the telephone, but eventually they had me download and updated version and things went smoothly from there.
551	0	This software comes with plenty of hidden and embedded fees for things that shouldn't be extra.  Electronic filing and using a credit card can cost as much as the software package, even if only one state is needed.
552	1	I have been very pleased with Avast.  I give them 5 stars!  I have only had them for short time and will use them again!
553	1	Makes doing your own taxes possible and depending upon how complicated a return one has, maybe even easy
554	1	Avast Free Antivirus has successfully protected my laptop for more than two years. I am very pleased with the level of protection it has provided, and I have referred several friends.  Great product!
555	-1	It's too complicated for a non a/p person. I am used to regular bank register not a register for every possible person I have traded with.
556	1	Excellent.
557	-1	After being a faithful customer for more years than I can count, I'm moving on. Whoever thought up these &#34;improvements&#34; should be fired. The public is not as gullible as Intuit seems to think.
558	-1	The default sharpening AfterShot Pro does on RAW camera files is very bad. I just wish the user settings would actually work when loading RAW files. Other than that, the image processing appears pretty fast, but the sharpening ruins the photo and you can't ever get a good image when the sharpening is set to 0.

560	0	TTD 2014 was not as user friendly for me when doing N. C. State tax. I liked the 2013 version better.  Also, I wish electronic filing for state is free.
561	-1	I have the 2014 version of this program and pretty much hate it.  Unless you are a tech geek or have aspergers you will likely find this program clunky and irritating to use.  If you are at all right brained and looking for something intuitive that can easily be played with to figure out how to use it look elsewhere.  Designs must be assembled in a specific order that is not readily apparent.  Instructions use arcane language such as &#34;dialog box&#34; and are worse than a car manual. For me they might as well be written in Chinglish.  The act of simply drawing a line can involve so many steps that I wish I'd just invested in a drafting table.  I'm so irritated with this program that the voice alone in the tutorial videos makes me want to scream.  If you take a class this program it may be usable but it certainly won't be fluid.  For me a total waste of $400 sum bucks.

569	-1	I cannot get it to work on my Vista Computer!  It is good it did not cost me any $$$$.  Maybe some day I can find a way to get it to load.
570	0	Turbo tax is getting more and more confusing.
571	0	We've used turbo tax for several years now. It does the job, but sometimes can be confusing...... If your taxes are fairly simple, it's probably ok. If not, you may want a real person to talk to.  (:
572	1	read the comments on how to set up and yeah, you'll be set. it works fine and i got it way cheaper than i would have normally.
573	1	Easy to use, everything is on the cloud and now I don't need to be worried about losing my work anymore!  I use it to create a big score for all the instruments and, later, see and print individual parts, one for each instrument.  It's cheaper than other notation software...

574	0	No, I meant to misspell checker to make a point.<br /><br />First, I love this software, the concept and operation is unlike any web builder I have ever used and it is fantastic.  The learning curve is near zero.  Hafing said that I want to point out two very important short comings:<br />#1.  The editor in Evolution 10 does not have a spell checker.  The Websige 5X team says it is too difficult to add a spell chicker and that you can do your articles or pages in a word processor like Microsoft Word then copy/paste into the Website 5X page editor.  Hum, last time I checkerd a page editor was supposed to do all of the editing.  Like telling you to use Ami word editor to use in Word editor??  You will notice misspelled words in this review to make a simple point -- even a simple editor, like the one used to type this review has a spell checker.<br />#2.  When you do as they suggest and write you pages in a word processor like Microsoft Word first and then satisfied with your work copy and paste it into the Website 5X page editor a strange thing happens -- the formatting you put in your Word doc or docx will be lost -- lost formatting means you have to then go over your page while in the Website 5X editor and reformat everything.  Considering that this is one of the more expensive web builders meant for everyone, pro or not, this is a serious flaw.  They are not alone in this #2 short coming.  But, when the Website 5X team suggests you use a different word processor to do you spell checking knowing that the formatting will be dropped is comical or just plain mean.  Because I like this software so much in its many other features, easy of use and quick uploads, etc.  I am staying with it hoping and hoping they will get enough pressure from consumers to add a spell checker.  They seem to think, also, that if they put and English spell checker within the page eiditor they will then have to include spell checkers for all the languages of the world -- Really?  It only makes sense to add and English spell checker as most of the world speaks English as a second language.  Other languages could be added after the initial placement of an English spell checker.  This makes me think their refusal is more political than anything else.  Get on their mailing list as they have offerings on their software with some substantial savings.  A couple of other and different types of Web Builders to check out would be Page Breeze ($20) and Site Spinner ($50).  If you do not need a spell checker and do all of your page composition within the Website 5X editor they no formatting issues, I would jump all over Website 5X as best Web Builder ever -- well, it would be if they ever decided to incorporate a spell checker -- hum, maybe Micrsoft would give them a license to embed thiers????  Are you listening Website 5X???sense to add and English spell checker as most of the world speaks English as a second language.

575	0	I think TurboTax is getting to big for their britches. They seem to think they are the only player in town by raising their cost 50%. May elect to try H&R Block next year.
576	-1	Had minor trouble installing this product finally did get it installed.<br /><br />I would say this software is more of an advertisement to entice people to upgrade to their more expensive software.
577	0	This is a good software teaching kids typing by providing typing games.  This is my second purchase and I am disappointed that the company did not update with to better fit MS Windows 8.  As such, the graphics seem dated.  It'll do the job but just not all that pretty.
578	0	I upgraded from Quicken 2005.<br />After waiting 9 years I expected more in an upgrade.<br />What I got was a register that changed the ability to show check numbers. I had to change it back (read spend an hour figuring it out).<br />It tracks investments, but I really only need it to keep track of a checking/savings account.<br />Nothing wrong with the new version, but if you have an old version for checking/savings tracking, keep it.
579	-1	"I just spent 2 hours going thru all the hassles described elsewhere, and to no avail. I spent my career in I.T. and NEVER experienced this level of incompetence.  I've contacted both Garmin Tech Support (wish me luck!) & Amazon via email, but doubt that any satisfaction will come easily.  If you can't keep the maps in your GPS up-to-date because of technical problems like this, then it's time to find another GPS maker (TomTom?)    5/4/2010 Update  Received email from Amazon, telling me that problem with key codes was solved & to try again.  It worked in that I sucessfully logged on & downloaded the disk image. Great!  Fired up the installer & it accepted the 2nd key code provided by Garmin. Great!  Almost immediately got an error message that \\""THERE WAS A PROBLEM DETERMINING THE AVAILABLE SPACE ON YOUR GARMIN GPS', and to contact GarminSupport.  Has anyone with a Mac 10.6 system & a Garmin c330 been successful?"
580	1	We use HR block at home every year and have great success, and it is much more cost effective than taking your taxes into the HR Block office.
581	-1	After using TurboTax for over 20 years, I hit a snag that makes me think it might be time to find a different software package. Return is all ready to e-file (Inuit has even taken the $19.99 to e-file my state return), but comes back with an error message saying it can't e-file because I need to update the software. I choose &#34;Check for Updates&#34; from the TurboTax menu (as instructed), only to be told there aren't any. So why won't it let me e-file?!?!?!?!
582	-1	I tried the free version. Ping ping ping all day. Never stops. Can't work. Same 4 virus trying  to whatever.<br />Loud voice from avast,,,threat has been detected...all day long. going to get mcatee or anyone else. stay away
583	0	Good Product
584	0	The conversion between file types needs a lot of work. Do not buy it if you want that function. If you want to combine PDF's or print to PDF... BUY THIS. It is awesome for that, not much else.
585	0	The software itself is designed for consumers with advanced knowledge of accounting.  If not, you will need to call customer service for help, however, they personally do not own or use the product and they read out mostly dumb answers from the manual which you are not asking for.  Even if you have the advanced knowledge, you very likely have to go to QuickBook forum or the internet searching for answers because the &#34;HELP&#34; function or the manual are not helpful AT ALL!!!!!
586	1	NO PROBLEMS, FREQUENT UPDATES, AND THOROUGH INTERVIEW.  AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN TURBOTAX SOFTWARE.  RECOMMEND HIGHLY FOR MORE COMPLEX TAX RETURNS.
587	0	This product was what it claimed to be, but you can do the federal for free online. Also, check website for state forms that you are able to file electronically, unless your wanting to submit by mail. The partial year form for Indiana was not able to be electronically submitted with this software. Would have been nice to have known this up front before spending. Ended up using TaxACT online and had to re-enter the information again.
588	-1	Download does not install properly and will not run. Amazon will not accept return. So out of luck, even if it was a discount. Puts Amazon out for any future software downloads
589	1	The best!!!
590	1	It had been a while since I had used Quicken before coming back to the fold.  I had switched to Microsoft Money but had to find another product when my bank stopped using the Money format.  They actually did me a favor.  I was a bit skeptical about coming back to Quicken, but what a difference.  My wife is a visual person so the color graphs are a huge help when talking about where we spend our money.  I like the detail and flexibility it provides with setting up and tracking expenses.  I've only scratched the surface of the extent to which the software can be utilized but I am suitably impressed.  I have no reservations in recommending that you purchase this product.
591	0	Not a huge fan of Norton, but it does the job. Not likely to purchase it again in the future, however.
592	0	Ok
593	0	Bought the download version from Amazon for the same reason everyone else did: Quicken's forced 3-year obsolescence, plus the relative ease of getting a refund from Intuit if the product is as bad as most reviews say.<br /><br />First thing: install the patches *manually* from Intuit's web site: http://goo.gl/GQVPd0, click on Manual Update. Be sure to update to R7 unless there is a newer patch around. Auto-update does not seem to work.<br /><br />After a small amount of use, it doesn't seem any worse than Quicken 2011.
594	1	Switched from Turbo Tax to H&R Block for our 2014 taxes.  I have a 4-year degree in accounting and 1 year I paid someone to do our taxes.  He screwed up and I have to file an amended return.  I decided never again.  I started using Turbo Tax because that was what my brother uses for our family construction company and his taxes.  After the epic fail with the new release by Turbo Tax for 2014 I thought I'd give H&R Block a try.  My Turbo Tax return came over as did all our information.  The step by step process of filling out the tax return wasn't any easier than Turbo Tax, nor would I say it was harder; just different, especially after using Turbo Tax for 4 years.  But with the lower price for H&R Block I think I can learn to adjust.
595	1	Tried some of the other programs, but they all seem to slow things down.<br />Avast works with you, not against you.
596	1	Years ago I used to boycott Norton Antivirus because it was slow and bloated.  However, about five or six years ago, Norton re-wrote their product from the ground up, and ever since then I have been a big fan.  Norton Antivirus 2014 offers fantastic protection for relatively little money, considering this contains three licenses, for use on three different PCs.  Not only is Norton usually rated either the best or the second best by various PC magazines (including Maximum PC), it does not bog down the PC.  It's hardly noticeable and has pretty much zero impact after installation.  It keeps itself up-to-date, and only notifies you when a problem occurs.  I find that Antivirus has everything I need:  protection from all kinds of malware and adware.  I like it better than Norton Internet Security or 360 because those products provide extra things I don't need, like parental guidance, etc.  Anti-virus has everything you need to keep you safe.
597	1	I have used AVAST for a few years now with little to no problems.  I have had a few confusing moments with Windows 8, but then that's Windows 8.  Avast has given me the protection I need for a very, very good price FREE...
598	1	So far this has been pretty easy to use. I was using Sage 50 and changed due to the increasing of fees each year. Quickbook Payroll was a lot cheaper and a lot more benefits! I like paying federal taxes threw quickbooks now if our state would get on board. April I will be getting to file 941 online!!!

600	0	This may be the last Adobe software I ever buy.  When I got PE6, I was impressed.  Then I made the mistake of &#34;upgrading&#34; to PE11.  My God, the loss of features was staggering.  Then, after deactivating, and re-installing on my new PC, 30 days later Adobe says PE11 license is not valid and product is now unusable.  Nearly 3 weeks later, after following Adobe's specific instructions, no one has even looked at my submitted case.  I complained to Amazon about Adobe in hopes that they could help get them to do something, anything.  Amazon customer service parachuted in and made things right by letting me upgrade at nearly no cost.<br /><br />As for the software, the continue lack of compatibility with Windows 64 bit programs, namely Outlook (Office 10), is so pitiful, they should be embarrassed.  After this, I am formally looking for an Adobe alternative.
601	0	I was required to have Microsoft Office for my work.  Since I work at home I was force to find a download of the program.  It's fine, it's Office.  There are other free resources available that work just as good (maybe even better) than a Microsoft product, but for my purposes it works fine.
602	-1	After using HR Block Business for my Form 1065 Partnership return and multiple Form 1041 Trust returns since 2006, I tried TT Business this year because I read that it now supports eFILE for Trust returns.  But after doing the first Trust return, it became apparent that there is no way to import Securities transactions into Schedule D / Form 8949 (which the IRS started to require for Trust returns two years ago).  For any Trust or business engaged in trading more than a few times a year, this is a non-starter for those who wish to eFILE.  For the Three Trust returns I have to do, I have over 500 securities transactions in 2014.  I doubt I could type all of those in by September 2015, even if I wanted to.<br /><br />The TT User interface is very pretty, and it does permit one to switch between interview and forms view when necessary, but the process of dealing with a Schedule D is very clunky.  While HR Block doesn't support data import to Form 8949 yet either, at least they have a spreadsheet-like data entry screen where one can paste rows of information from an Excel file rather than type EVERY number into a screen form for hundreds of transactions.<br /><br />Like another user, I've also discovered that there are a number of items on the Form 1041 that cannot be over-ridden, and allocations of Trust expenses between income and principle is impossible (well ... maybe not, but after several hours of trying to figure it out, I gave up).<br /><br />TT Business also doesn't have any of the &#34;Import last year data from a PDF of last year's tax return&#34; capability that their less expensive personal products support.  So migrating from another product means that you must start from absolute scratch with filling out every form and tiny box on your business returns.<br /><br />I give it two stars because the UI / Interview is easy to work with.  But the lack of ability to import Securities transactions into Schedule D / Form 8949 doesn't add enough value to me to justify the much higher price of this software over competing software from TaxAct or HR Block.
603	0	Originally tried out the 30-day trial.  Used it to do some editing on a low-budget feature 4K movie that was done with RED cameras (R3D video file format). I had never used this editor before and the learning curve was very steep.  The so-called manual Adobe supplies is a great 400+ page sales brochure but it lacked details; all it really does it tell you what it is capable of doing but not the how's.  There is a lot of stuff that I figured out by intuition and trial and error and a lot of things I never did figure out how to get to work, in spite of slogging through the terabytes of Adobe postings and tutorials.  Searches for specifics rarely brought up anything useful. Also I hate the video tutorials since at the beginning they appear to be what I am looking for but I have to endure most of the tutorial just to find out that it isn't at all what I was looking for. Adobe really needs to work on their documentation. A lot.  A note to anyone that wants to use this editor for editing feature length movies:  Make sure you have a medium to high end computer with a high end graphics processor. I have a HP Phoenix box Windows 8.1 Pro with a 4-core i7 @ 3.2GHz, 16GB RAM, 4 TB HDD storage and 6TB USB3 external storage. Dual monitors with DVI. That part was fine but the graphics card is a GeForce GT640 with 2GB RAM (probably only cost about $100). The USB3 is a bit slow but okay (but keep your cables short !). This GT640 graphics card is the real bottleneck - Rendering was REALLY slow - we're talking 12 hours - start it up in the afternoon and come back in the morning and hope it didn't crash.  Need a much faster graphics card to get it down to 2-3 hours.  Another thing I encountered was the 2013 edition failed to load or run on my rig with Windows 8 but the 2014 edition works fine.  Addendum: switched to a Sapphire Radeon R9 270X 4GB GDDR5 and have it cranked up.  It is now around 2 hours to make a H.264 1920x1080 rendering of a 107 minute feature.  Make sure you have a 500-watt power supply, minimum, in order to use the board.  Recommend &#34;An Editor's Guide to Adobe Premiere Pro&#34; as a learning tool. It was written for Premiere Pro CS6 but most of the material is still quite useful.  Yet-another addendum: I have since finished my part of editing the feature and have uninstalled Premiere since it is still, in my opinion, difficult to learn and use.  Regardless, I can see that it does have a lot of nice features, some of which do not exist on any other similar editor (such as using markers to sync video and sound, for example). I'm sure that with the proper training, probably 3 months worth, I would be able to use it skillfully. However, I only had 3 months to do the edit so I had no choice.   Also, and not related to Premiere, I have removed the Sapphire Radeon R9 270X due to hardware/software conflicts: I suspect that there are resource conflicts since once the board was installed, my second internal DVD burner stopped working and the internal SD card reader stopped working. Once I removed this Sapphire card and put back the GeForce GT640, everything went back to normal. Also, this card has  a hardware problem related to the video RAM (intermittently unstable with either jumping displays or complete loss of sync).
604	0	Typical Turbotax product.  It does it's job, however, be aware if doing estate or trust taxes which contain partnerships (K-1's), it does not support K-1's.  I have no idea why on a product which costs this much they don't include something which is in all of their other tax products.
605	-1	DOES NOT FIX YOUR COMPUTER IF YOU HAVE VISUSES OR SPYWARE.  Stops some viruses and lets others through  Norton wants $100 to get ride of everything then they claim their product will work right.  i do not trust them
606	0	Paid for the subscription and now its free on phones. I feel kind of cheated. Also, its Office, so from that perspective it is exactly what I expected. I am not a Microsoft hater, quite the contrary, I really like Microsoft products. But I must say, I am very disappointed with the integration between the Surface Pro and My Desktop or cloud based Windows systems. You would think sharing outlook contacts, schedule, and email would be a huge advantage and benefit of having Microsoft. I fought with it for a month before I gave up.<br /><br />Oh, just for completeness. Setting it up and using it on Windows 7 and Windows 8 tablet was very simple.
607	1	It made doing my taxes fast and easy
608	-1	I have used TurboTax for years and never paid so much for a State Tax return. I'm just going to suffer through the terrible states website and do it for free. It says right on the product description: &#34;1 State product via download (Print for free or e-file for $19.99 per return)&#34; but it wont even let you  look at it unless you pay their outrageous price. So is it $45 to download it and then another $20 to file it? Might be my last time getting TurboTax this year I think.
609	1	I have used Master Cook for many years. I keep it open on my toolbar and then I can copy recipes directly into the program. No saving or sharing to save! I love it!
610	-1	Your Amazon technician was not very knowledgeable.  I could not get the program to work after downloading it.  Your tech. could not figure it out and sent me to Intuit to solve the problem.
611	-1	Will not download regardless of what I do. Followed Amazon help instructions, all of them and still could not download it.
612	0	I have used Turbo Tax for years with no problems but this version gave me problems.  Things I couldn't change after checking them, one review of the return said I had 40 errors which included lack of all my personal info, but then after I shut down computer that didn't appear. It also showed extra income line which for the life of me I couldn't figure out what that was. Just not as easy as years past.
613	1	Nice product!
614	0	Norton is good, there customer service was amazing but because I purchased a download from Amazon they have no record of the purchase and upon contacting Amazon they said once you hit the download button it is considered a used product and they do not do returns or refunds so Norton's 30 day money back guarantee means nothing..so please do not purchase the download version through Amazon..I have never had any other issues at Amazon and will still recommend them continue to shop from them,but no more downloads
615	-1	After a lot of reading on the web the problem seems to be that Quicken no longer knows what a &#34;brokerage *checking* account&#34; is.  I've stuck with Q 2007 (and OS10.6.8) for years because Quicken 2007 *would* download both the investment info *and* the checking info.  Actually, I'm not concerned with the accuracy of the investment info but do want the checking info to follow my cash flow.  My brokerage firm keeps up with the buys, sells, reinvests, transfers, 1099s etc. just fine.  I trust my personal wealth manager at my firm to invest for me and do not second guess her.  I do spot check but if I had the expertise to really stay on top of things then I'd be a broker, right?  I don't have that expertise so I'm left with needing expert advice.  The bottom line is really all that's important and the rest is a full time job IMHO. I already have a full time job ...<br /><br />Well, beginning 10/1/14 Q 2007 stopped downloading any checking transactions.  Contacting support at both Quicken and my brokerage firm only lead to denials and finger pointing.  What a shock, right?  Wouldn't you love to get all parties in the same room hooked up to lie detectors?  Somebody somewhere is either a liar or is incompetent.  One just cannot escape one or the other conclusion ...<br /><br />OK, OS 10.6.8 is now a relic and so is Q 2007.  I figured my best hope was then to upgrade to OS10.7.5 (my old Mac won't run any higher) and to try Q 2015.  Keeping my fingers crossed I did the upgrades and, you guessed it, Q 2015 doesn't get it either.  As best I can tell this version will only support a pure brokerage account and a *linked* checking account NOT a *combined* brokerage/checking account as 2007 did previously. It's actually less sophisticated than Q 2007 in that respect!!!<br /><br />So after a lot of tinkering, reading etc. I'm back to the 2007 version (and OS 10.8.6) and hand entering checking transactions until something workable comes along.  I do have another Mac with OS10.9 that the rest of the family uses so I decided to try the Q 2015 on it just to see what would happen.  But after several downloads of the Quicken 2015 program and several restores/reinstalls I did to try to get the Q2015 to work I lost the installer.  I couldn't download 2015 again without PAYING for it again!  I'll be pucked if I'll buy 2015 a second time unless I have the promise of a firstborn from someone that it will serve my needs!!!!!<br /><br />Why did Intuit offer such a buggy program in the first place?
616	1	After reading the poor reviews about Turbo Tax I switched to H & R Block this year.  I agree with the others, it imports easily - automatically - from Turbo Tax.  Unfortunately, I had some complex issues regarding retirement fund distributions (retired in late 2013) and the program said I owed quite a bit and perhaps underpayment penalties.  Not wanting to give up so much money, I took it to H&R Block, my friend owned it prior to selling out for his own retirement and still helps during tax season, he saved me $1800, even with their fee. But, then, my tax issue is so rare in my area that he had never before run across it.  However, I also do taxes with it for other family members, much simpler ones than mine, and so far it works just as well as Turbo Tax for them.
617	0	I have used Quicken since 1998. The program seems to have more bugs and flaws with every release. I purchased 2015 because I had so many issues with 2013. The issues seem to follow.<br />Next year I may transfer to Microsoft Money.
618	1	I'm normally very wary of buying software without a CD to allow reinstallation, a holdover from the copy-protection wars when vendors tried not to let us install anything more than one time on one PC, even if the hard drive later failed.<br /><br />The H&R Block At Home 2011 software download was a delight, compared to former days and other programs. Like other digital products purchased through Amazon, Amazon remembers what I've purchased, and makes it easy to get it again if necessary. The entire installation process, including starting the program, checking for upgrades (none yet) and entering my key code took only a few minutes via cable broadband. It also quickly and easily read in my data from last year, and offered helpful YouTube videos on changes this year. I now have to wait until the next update expected on January 12 before entering dependents and income.<br /><br />I've used H&R's tax programs for several years, and been very happy except for having to file a correction last year due to the program initially missing the fact that I'd paid property taxes on my home. (I reported that bug, so don't expect it to be a problem again, but will be sure to check again once I have all my tax forms to enter.) As I pretty much know what I'm doing tax-wise, and my state already offers a simple Web-based way to file my state income tax, this basic verson is all I need. If you want more handholding or a state program too, there are other more advanced versions available, and you'll be offered those if the program thinks you might need them.<br /><br />I'll update this around the end of January, once I have all the needed 1099s etc. and have filed. But for now, this is a very pleasant, inexpensive and ecological way to quickly and accurately take care of a nasty unavoidable annual chore.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Update: OK, I filed electronically tonight. I had previously gotten right up to the point of filing, but held off for the update that came out in late February, just in case it fixed anything important. I also reconfirmed a few entries and corrected one I'd guessed wrong about before, now that I had the official document in hand. Perhaps as a result of the changes, the program no longer remembered my last year's AGI value or our PINS, so I had to override those as I submitted this evening. Fortunately, I always write those down as I print out the final form, so had them handy. Since I amended last year's return later, I was glad to see this year's program told me to still use the AGI value from my initial return, rather than the amended one.<br /><br />Still recommended.e February, just in case it fixed anything important.

619	1	Was using parsons technology back in the day and started using Turbotax when it took parsons over been using Turbotax for many years with no problems.
620	1	I had already moved to Premier a couple of years ago after seeing the Deluxe version was not as good at investments, so no whining here about the need to go to Premier other than I sure would've liked that same discount the whiners got :)  (ok there were some legitimate reasons for whining, TurboTax was not clear about the changes, but glad they did admit their mistake finally and tried to make it right).<br /><br />I installed first on a 5 yr old slow Win7 laptop, and (barely) started our return in early January (installed and ran fine there as is it did in previous years). I then got a new laptop (Win8.1, Dell), and wanted to do my return there. I copied over the TT files from the previous years to the new machine, and the one I started for 2014. I downloaded TT again to the new machine, it installed fine and went through its updates. It pulled in my 2013 return info with no problem. Instead of using the 2014 file I copied over I started a new return again and replaced that one (there is probably a way to continue using the one started on the other machine but didn't try it). Like being able to login to my broker account from the TT software and have it import that 1099 info.<br /><br />So - actual time spent - probably was only about 2 hours - downloaded, installed, updated, and completed our 2014 return, and e-Filed to federal and state. Took me longer because between start & finish I also drank a few beers, did a little cooking, and had to track down a couple of donations. :)
621	1	I have used Tax Cut and H&R Block at Home Premium for the past six or seven years without ever before experiencing a problem.  This year when I input zip codes both for my work address and my home address, H&R Block Premium automatically changed the state to the wrong state.  It then would not let me electronically submit my return because the state did not match the zip code, yet it would not let me correct the problem.  After two calls to customer service where I had to wait on hold for 20 minutes each time, I finally was able to resolve the probelm and then submit my return.  Other than that it was a good product.
622	-1	very limited not easily navigated, would not recommend, not enough options, no ability to be creative, could be unsettling for some
623	1	Works better than anything I've used.  It's had some difficulty btwn i/j and y/v,  and recognizing &#34;@&#34;.<br /><br />I'm still learning all the correction/redaction features.  But it's performance has already exceeded my expectations.
624	-1	I read alot of the complaints about the changes to the user interface in 2013 and was a little leary.  After installing it, it seems fine. User interfaces change over time....you gotta role with the punches or our screens would still look like Windows NT.<br />My bigger gripe is with Intuit FORCING me to create an intuit.com account and then subjecting me to 5 minutes of annoying questions in order to register the product.<br />- Do you want to accept credit cares<br />- Size of my business<br />- # of employees<br />- DO you do payroll<br />- blah<br />- blah<br />-blah<br /><br />Hey Intuit - Stop the blatant and ridiculous series of questions so that you can send me emails about all the great upgrades I could get for Quickbooks.  I've ALREADY bought your software. I'm a small business owner - i.e. someone who already spends more time on my accounting software than I want to.<br />All of those questions are ridiculous time wasters for no one's benefit but Intuits.  Therefore I intentionally answer the questions with bogus answers just to make your database of data to mine as wrong as possible (guess what...I'm not the only one that does this)<br />So...please stop annoying me by forcing me to be part of your product development focus group data - or perhaps next time pay me to be part of the focus group.
625	-1	Do NOT buy this software. The price was too good to be true.<br />I had issues downloading the software and when I called their &#34;Award winning customer service team&#34; they told me I had to pay a minimum of $169.00 to make the software work. After over 1 hour of communications with them over a remote connection they brought the price down to $99.00 then when I said no they brought the price down to $69.00.<br />I am now still without a security program for my laptop and am out $20.00.<br />Please remember, if it sounds too good to be true run away.
626	1	I give Avast a 5 because I have been using this antivirus for many years now. I've had no problems with viruses infecting my computer. Best of all, it does not slow my computer the way other virus protection programs have done. I can't think of anything I don't like about it and I would recommend it to my family and friends. Keep up the good work.
627	-1	Intuit's Turbotax has always produced the benchmark tax software and I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for as long as I can remember. However, I am moving to another product this year based upon these horrible reviews. What Intuit probably doesn't realize is that the customers they lose this year because of their greed and false advertising will probably never return.
628	1	It works fast return easy to do
629	0	You get a lot for a free product, and it guides you through your taxes well.  However they don't let you save your tax as a real document without paying some money. Luckily there are some print to PDF solutions that work. In addition if you move the folder they automatically save your return in they delete the whole thing, and give you a message about their software only being for use with one tax return.  So wherever they put the folder on your computer it must stay there for eternity, or as long as you want to save your tax return in the software. They don't mention that little gem to you!
630	1	I have used TaxCut Basic for over five years with no problem.  The free e-file is a plus and up to four more family members can use it.  Of course, more than that can use the program if they file a paper return.<br /><br />I don't bother with their state programs because my state has free on-line tax filing that is fairly easy to use...probably not as easy as the H&R Block software.
631	-1	It won't install updates
632	-1	It was strictly basic vocabulary words, nothing more.
633	1	I have been using Turbo Tax 11 years, it has far exceeded expectations. They are batting at a clip of 11 for 11. I have owed  taxes in some of these years, but their accuracy kept the IRS from my door steps. As the young kids say, &#34;They're hot&#34;.
634	0	Works fine and does what it was programmed to do.  Does not play well with Wells Fargo Advisors and probably other brokerages -- That was the only reason for upgrading (plus the 50% off).  All in all, I do not feel cheated, but I don't feel good about it either.  Next time I will just go to GnuCash directly.
635	1	What can I say?  It saves me a lot of money by finding all my qualified deductions without having to pay a CPA!
636	1	It saved my system multiple times.<br />The best item is the boot time scan.<br />Most viruses don't penetrate your system until you restart/reboot.
637	0	Always trying to sell an upgrade. I believe the earlier versions were more flexible.
638	-1	When I finished my taxes I was supposed to receive 2,088.00 in a refund. As it turned out I only received 2,078.02 . I guess that somebody decided that turbo tax was entitled to an extra 10.00 dollars. I may look for another source for my tax preparation service next year !!!
639	1	Beginner. So far, it's excellent. Installed easily, instructions clear.
640	-1	and can't get any assistance and difficult to find assistance through Amazon. Big error. Have downloaded downloader and the software numerous time - 3 hours so far -no results. Irritating!
641	1	excelente programa
642	0	The IRS is not refunding money owed to taxpayers in a timely manner. Turbo Tax has no provisions for answers to problems with the IRS. I filed my return on January 28, 2013 and as of March 1, 2013 I have still not received any information as when my refund is coming.
643	-1	I attempted to download the program on a second computer (my wife's) and it failed to download.  Don't know what was the problem.
644	-1	Take your taxes to an accountant...you will get a bigger refund!
645	0	Good, but not great. Lot of features have glitches.
646	1	This really was a simple setup and very easy to use. I have been a quickbooks user for many years so that may have made it a bit easier than a first time user, but the old desktop version I was using had so many features I never used and they really got in the way of what should otherwise be easy bookkeeping tasks. I am so glad there is a simple version now that just works well. It integrated seamlessly with my banking account and my intuit card reader so everything is in one place. The greatest feature is the ability to be paid online directly from the invoice that I email to my clients. Great product for anyone that has a small service based business.
647	0	Good
648	0	I don't like the way MS handles their proprietary software.  It's a ripoff, but we seem to be stuck with it.
649	1	Great product, have used for many years and they improve on it every year, having teenagers I want secure internet security :)
650	0	At first everything seemed to be working well then the computer started running slow and then in the middle of trying to get emails the Avast warning would always appear and requesting to upgrade, update etc.. which had become EXTREMELY annoying. While I understand that you offer a free service which is great I do not think that those of us who use this free service does not care to spend additional money on an upgrade if what your are doing now is suppose to help us. I think that ONLY important information when it is due and needed only then should we get alerts, but not continuously bombarding consumers with constant annoyances such as upgrades in order for you guys to make more money. That should be left up to the consumer who can afford it and on their own time.
651	0	This product works well and is easy to use.Great price. But my computer got slow and it freezes a lot
652	0	I have had quicken for years and was once again required to update my version because of the threat of lack of support and download ability.  I have had minor problems for years that I have managed to work around more or less.  This time the 2014 version is a real pain.  I waited until the last minute in hopes that the bugs the other reviewers had mention would have been worked out....They have not.  It is extremely irritating that the program can't even enter a managed reminder transaction when I want it to.  Stupid.  Quicken used to be a fantastic program that certainly had some bugs that the support staff would work out.  It has gone downhill.  Any support you get now is from other users that intuit posts on their site.  I will continue to use it as (1) I have already purchased it. (2) my banks will download to it. (3) my spouse is &#34;new program weary&#34;.  However I will continue to look for a new program that is as versatile as quicken used to be.  What a shame.  I WANT to like it.
653	1	Great Deal and I didn't even have to leave the house to get it.  Downloaded it and started to use it.  Very happy with it.  Would order again next year.
654	0	"I decided to \\""try out\\"" the 1-month trial version, which installed successfully. The interface is great on Windows 8, tablet or not. The search feature, particularly in Word 2013 has greatly improved with searching the Heading, Body, and even Paragraph for the keywords.<br /><br />Sadly, the only downside is that Excel 2013 crashes randomly every time I load a blank worksheet or load an existing file from my hard drive. It might be a bug issue from using in the Cloud. It's very rare but possible to find the previous version of Office, as I still own a copy of Office 2007 Enterprise. I'm looking to upgrade to its predecessor, Office 2010, as the 2013 version is way overpriced for subscription-based. Microsoft has headed the downhill route despite improving it's interface and usability.Therefore, I uninstalled it and cancel the trial mode.<br /><br />Thanks but no thanks. I'll save my $100 for something that is reliable like OpenOffice or LibreOffice, a much more stable software. At least it's free and do most of the tasks I want it to."
655	0	"Had for 2 months. Kids (8 and 11) love this fun typing game. Okay instructional portion, but fun practice activities that my kids want to do again and again. They get to choose their own music to type to(and although repeative at that point) there are lots of choices. Kids skills have increased quickly. What can we say, although this mom finds it to be a little cheesy, my kids don't seem to notice and love \\""Typer Island.\\""<br />*EDIT* dropped to 3 stars from 5 because of some interesting choices of words to type. I realize combinations of letters are trying to be taught, but many words are unfamiliar to kids. Words like hormone, and even libido? Really? Young kids aren't going to know the words but my 11 year old was asking about meanings. We really like the program but heads up for parents trying to keep track what their kids are viewing. Wouldn't of thought I needed to preview this."
656	0	Why I had to upgrade from a deluxe version is the question when I did not need the premium program? I have been using Turbotax  for over 15 years and this year is the first time I had to upgrade.
657	-1	I just spent the morning on the phone to cancel the Norton automatic renewal.  They charge FULL PRICE for a product that can be bought at a fraction of the cost.  You can even buy an older version and get updated to the most recent one.  Why would I pay eighty dollars for something I can get for thirty?  This is pretty shady, and no way to treat your customers.  Furthermore I am not sure how they even got my credit card info, since I bought the product through Amazon as a DL and not from Norton directly.  My time is valuable, and I resent being forced to spend it on the phone with a foreigner who can barely speak English (no offense to the foreign employees, they are just doing their jobs).  I really have better things to do.<br /><br />Horrible customer service, shady practices, this is a company that I want nothing to do with.  I will be taking my business to a competitor that does not try to secretly gouge me.
658	-1	I have used TurboTax Deluxe for years, and been very happy with it.  I'm a Homeowner with some investments and found the (old) versions ability to pull in data from investment brokers and mutual funds very helpful.  This functionality is no longer present in the 2014 Deluxe version, and I would be required to pay much more, and purchase the Premier version to have the same functionality.<br /><br />Considering that H&R Block offers software that meets my needs, at a far lower price, I'm going with H&R Block.
659	-1	Quicken for Windows is an excellent product. I have used it for 20 years.  It is a real shame that Intuit/Quicken will not transfer that learning to the Mac platform.  This is very poor performer and Intuit should be ashamed to offer this product with the Quicken name on it.
660	0	"Quicken 2014 did not hurt me, whew! I say that because Quicken 2013 was a nightmare, and yet it was a relief from 2012 which completely messed up my favorite feature, the budget. I update Quicken every year as I have since the early 1990's. I've long since given up looking for new features. Now what I look for is a product that brings back the ones I used to like, makes them quicken and merges with mint as a single product. I use Quicken for all of my accounts as I do mint. Each brings something to the table. Don't waste your time on the quicken mobile version. Use mint for that. I'm afraid to even try it this year. After synching, it really messed up data in 2013.<br /><br />So, here are the new \\""features\\"" I'm observing in 2014:<br /><br />1. It installed quickly and ran right away, converting my data without complaint.<br /><br />2. One step update still works! It still has the checkbox for only showing the summary dialog if no errors, but there are always errors. Only now it shows errors but when I expand the list everything is green! In other words it things something is wrong but is keeping it from me.<br /><br />3.  The budget is still there, looks exactly the same but is a bit more sluggish. Must be lots of stuff going on behind the scenes.<br /><br />4.  All those shortcut keys that have been there for years and years no longer work! For example, hit ctl-g or ctl-f from the register and the computer goes booooinngg and nothing else happens! I think you have some focus issues to fix because the menus still show the keys available.<br /><br />5.  After one step update the register still returns you to the end, not to the current day marker, something I've hoped for for years and seems obvious as I add data way ahead of the current date. Doesn't everyone?<br /><br />6.  The budget still likes to randomly place you anywhere in the budget which is just a glorified, slower spreadsheet just like before.<br /><br />7.  Registers scroll a little more sluggishly, sweet! And, to top that off, it scrolls ahead on you so that if you lean a little too hard on the scroll keys you'll find yourself back in 2004!<br /><br />Sorry that this is such a sarcastic review, but I'm assuming that all of this was intentional. Any SQA person would have noticed these things in the first 10 minutes so they must be features, not bugs.<br /><br />By the way, I still recommend Quicken to people (and mint), but only because there is no competition, which I'm sure comes up in the release go/no-go meetings as a decision point."
661	0	The 2014 version has major issues with the Icon bar, which I use constantly to train clients on the most efficient use of QuickBooks... so this is a BIG deal for me.  The icon bar occasionally disappears and is almost impossible to retrieve.<br /><br />You also have to mess around with the icon bar to get color back and the icons are not as nice as prior years..<br /><br />But, a good new feature is the collapsible item feature on reports.
662	1	I am a retired homeowner. With work problems, and raising children  I remember having problems remembering to pay bills on time, or know my account balances so I have used quicken for many years to to help solve those problems.  My credit score went up because those nagging late payment items went away. Now that I am retired, I continue to use it to track all my financial items.
663	0	So, I rated the software as &#34;It's ok&#34; because it looks exactly the same as my 2014 version. I buy the upgrades hoping there would be a marked improvement in the user interface. It's still the same interface as 10 years ago. I mean seriously, I know the product is a cash cow for the company but you would think they would try to merge their mint.com product and user experience while differentiating the products even though they are complementary. Why is there a quicken cloud sync and it doesn't sync to mint.com?<br />It's one thing to keep the products separate so that consumers aren't confused but it's another thing to have no product strategy that adds value for the consumer. So, what, it will be expensive to overhaul the product? I'm not going to buy another version of quicken ever again until Intuit does something to provide more value and a better user experience.
664	-1	I don't like this Norton Utilities at all. It interferes with my computer.
665	1	We use Turbo Tax every year.  Easy and quick returns.
666	0	Maybe this product helps some people, but it did nothing for me except nag me to purchase the upgrade. At least it's free...
667	-1	After having to upgrade twice I gave up and filed an extension.  Not sure what I'll use for finishing but it will cost way more to get this done than is satisfactory for me.
668	0	I'm disappointed I wanted to download my movies that purchased, oh my I don't have a Kindle or a Fire tablet.
669	0	I have been unable to print an address to envelopes in the 2013 or 2014 versions of Quicken.  I have tried just about everything. I finally got hold of a live person at customer service but he was unable to get the problem corrected.  Even getting this live person was a hard task.  I gave this product four stars but after writing this note I went back and gave it only three stars.
670	-1	TERRIBLE!!!!  STAY AWAY.  This download came with lots of MALWARE, and did NOTHING to help my PC.
671	0	It's easy to follow....easy to use....However, without practices set up to perform on your own it's really only more like an overview.  The multiple choice questions at the end of each lesson...are well, multiple choice, and who can't pick out the most right answer, not very helpful.
672	-1	Removing everything but the basics from the &#34;Deluxe&#34; edition.  Absurd.
673	-1	This is absolutely nothing like Quicken for Windows. It has a completely different appearance and interface. If you're wishing to convert from using Quicken for Windows to Quicken for Mac you have to download a conversion tool to the windows computer and then go through a lot of trouble to shorten descriptions, categories, and payee names. Transaction input and account reconciliation is not as easy to do as on windows. Is it too much to ask for the software to resemble the software for windows? Microsoft doesn't seem to have a problem doing it.
674	-1	This software consumes a large amount of disk space but you cannot select the installation location. I run a small SSD as my c:\ drive and a d:\ 2TB drive for all my data and programs. This software is the first I've ever installed that does not allow me to select an installation to the d:\ drive. Technical support is completely worthless, None of their requirements state it MUST be installed to c:\, and even though I have 1TB of free space the software will not install. This is the very first software package I have encountered that does not offer an option to specify the installation location.<br /><br />And because Amazon does not offer refunds on software downloads, I'm out $159.00 dollars with nothing to show for it except a few hours of my time wasted. Waiting to hear back from RosettaStone Customer Support who is looking into a solution.
675	0	Only thing annoying is constant pop up reminders to check for updates. Seem to always happen on Sunday when I am doing graphics in my church. Sure would be nice to stop these reminder. I know it has auto updates, but they seem to happen when I most need the CPU for my work.
676	-1	I read all the reviews and was little bit out of my mind and still took my chances.  McAfee is a scam they have some bug which does not allow you to install and their technicians are of no use, they act as if they tried everything and then ask you go pay 89 buck for their real service, why should I pay? Its a horrible feeling when you get cheated
677	0	I purchased this for my Toshiba notebook, and was given the product key with no instructions.  I searched around the microsoft website to see if they had a download link (perhaps if I use a search for product key upgrade install), but their product support was focused on selling the product, not really support.  After a few minutes of Google-ing around, I found a marketing link that showed a tiny video of how easy the process was.  Note, the video was about how easy the process is, but not really WHAT the process is.      Now that I'm burried in the humilation of feeling that I must be the only MORON on the planet who has not figured this very obvious and easy solution.  A few replays of the tiny video, and I could faintly see which icons are getting opened, I try to repeat the process.  So here it is.  Step 1.  Go to the windows button in the lower left corner and open up the program listing.  Step 2.  Find the program listed Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade (how did they predict that we would want to upgrade).  Step 3. follow instructions.  Step 4. Curse Microsoft and Toshiba for conspiring to provide an operating system such as Windows 7 Starter - like buying a car with no seats.  Step 5.  Begin to wonder if Microsoft has really made any improvements to the Windows OS in the last ten years. Step 6. Start to consider if my next computer will be an Apple.
678	-1	I don't understand the high ratings of Bitdefender.  I am highly computer savvy but still need their customer support to help install the product.  Apparently there are problems installing directly from the disc into Windows 7 64bit.  When things started crashing after installation, I again called customer support.  They wanted me to send dumps from their utility and then would respond within 48 hours.  This is unacceptable with a frozen computer.  I then called AOL who took control of my system on line and fixed the problem immediately.  Bitdefender offers the worst customer support I have ever experienced.
679	1	Good delivery and value
680	0	Not many changes except for being charged for extras that should be FREE!  What a disappointment that Intuit has found ANOTHER way to shortchange their customers.  Isn't having us renew every 3 years enough?  Not to mention the extra fees charged to us, such as support, plus more! Personally, lucky for me, I do not use payroll for my business.  However, in my other job, my boss does...wonder what he will do with this?
681	1	works great with self employement
682	1	I have a MAC and my daughter needed Microsoft Office to work on homework. It was so fast and easy to download. I'm glad I got it. Didn't have to run to the store to get the program, Amazon made shopping easy!
683	1	I guess this is a good program. I haven't received any viruses yet, as far as I can tell. It's free. Why not try it?
684	-1	I purchased Norton Internet Security in 2012 from Amazon and have been keeping it updated/renewed. Things were going well, including support, until just recently. I had some malware on two of my computers so I called Norton. The tech concluded that I indeed have some major problems, that it wasn't Norton's fault (and I don't know how to evaluate that), and then he went into a sales pitch to get me to sign up with a third party vendor called Barewire to take care of the problem for $500, which supposedly included a 3 year service agreement. I gave my email address but stopped there. Barewire then emailed me an authorization agreement with a duration of 30 days, not 3 years. I called Barewire and was told I'd have to electronically sign the agreement to see the real terms (kind of like Pelosi saying we had to pass the ACA to see what's in it)!<br /><br />I ended up taking my computers to a local tech who solved the problem for a total of $125. I then emailed Barewire saying I rejected their offer and wanted nothing more to do with them. They called me and wouldn't take no for an answer until I had to hang up on them.<br /><br />I give this two stars rather than one because, up to now, I have been satisfied. But this is enough to make me totally disgusted with Norton. Because of this--not to mention that they are sinking in Consumer Reports' ratings--I will not renew my subscription.<br /><br />One final interesting note: As of today, when I google Barewire, Norton's Safeweb rating for the barewire.us site is the gray &#34;Untested ?&#34;.
685	1	I downgraded from Quickbooks Pro to Quicken Home & Business and I really love it.....glad I Did......Quickbooks is a good program but too complexed and a memory hog....Thanks Quicken
686	1	I have been using Quicken for over 15 years now and wouldn't change, I started out with just basic quicken and as my account needs changed Quicken had the software that fit the needs at each stage in my finical life.
687	-1	I have used turbo tax for years with old computer. purchased a mac and have not been able to download.
688	-1	I was not able to open some files I made in Open Office with other software. Open Office also did not open files created in other programs. Even though it didn't provide everything it promised, it did get me over the hump while I waited for other software to arrive.
689	1	Works smoothly and efficiently for my particular needs.  The on-line download also was convenient and saved going to a brick and mortar store.
690	1	Always simple to download and install. Nortons always keeps my computer protected. Using amazon account, I don't have to put on a flashdrive or burn to a disk to install on the other computers.
691	1	This software is well organized and simple to use. Instructions are clear, you don't need to do much study to start the tax filing. I only have one complaint, that is when I update the software, it shows gathering information and took forever to finish. Finally I found out it's scanning my hard drive, and I have a 8TB RAID! No wonder it took so long. But after I eject the hard drive, the installation finished right away. It's a bit scary that it scans your whole hard drive while showing 'gathering information'...but I think it's just attempting to look for previous saved tax filing archive.<br /><br />I'm using a Mac, by the way.
692	0	I have been a Norton user for a number of years, and think this will be my last. The renewal cost is at least twice as much as buying a new product. Installation took 3-4 attempts. Didn't automatically add remaining time to new program, had to call the service center. The mobile app is not one of the 3 licenses available. On the plus side, I do believe it is good at stopping attacks and keeping the computer virus free.
693	-1	I am glad I read these reviews about removing schedule D. I have been using Turbo Tax Deluxe for 20 years, but will be purchasing HR Block's product this year. What Product Manager or Marketing VP made this decision? Money always goes where it is treated best. Next year, expect either Intuit to correct their mistake or HR Block to follow Intuit's lead. This policy is so unbelievable that it is the first time I have ever reviewed a product on Amazon.<br /><br />I noticed a few years ago that the price jumped from $35 to $50 because they included the e-file as mandatory. They used to charge $15 for the e-file. This was probably mandated by the government as HR Block did the same thing at the same time. One of the IRS's mandates was to reduce costs by encouraging e-filing. After more research, Intuit along with other entities are funneling money to Congress against making the tax code easier and less complicated because that affects their revenue stream.<br /><br />http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/27/turbotax-maker-funnels-millions-to-lobby-against-easier-tax-returns/<br />http://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing<br />http://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2013/04/15/the-tax-complexity-lobby/
694	-1	After using Q14 for 1.5 weeks, the database became corrupted despite there never being any abnormal terminations of the app or my computer.  Q14 would not allow me to use a backup copy and offered no alternatives, so I had to delete it and rollback to Q13.  Fortunately, I only had a week or so of transactions to reconcile.  I'm now back on the old version and happy.  But my experience with Q14 was disappointing, to say the least...
695	1	This is the quickest and easiest way to upgrade your version of Windows 7 Premium to Professional and you are saving money compared to buying directly from Microsoft.
696	-1	"I wish there was a \\""0\\"" star!!!  I have used Turbo Tax for many years. The download of Deluxe in January 2014 would not do IRS updates and thus would not complete my return. It was April 13th so I proceeded to buy Turbo Premiere and it did the job. A big thanks to Amazon for the refund on a poor product."
697	0	It's a decent tax prep program with a few glitches. Main complaint:  Customer support (which is included in the version I purchased) is non responsive.  Attempted to resolve issue and was on hold to over 45 mins. 2 times.  Contacted accountant friend who provided the support I required.  Makes you wonder what kind of support one would received if there was ever an audit issue. I will look into Turbo or another next year.
698	1	We have used this tax tool for several years, and we always find the experience to be worth the expense. Everything works smoothly, and the program imports so many things into our return that our effort is minimal. The forma are always filled out correctly, the proper calculations are made, and the arithmetic is always correct. The stae forms are een more effortless than the federal. Finally, the e-filing is quick and flawless.
699	1	Besides keeping track of the games you play and have played, what I like best is when I am offline on my other gaming services but using RAPTR I can still see who is online and what they are playing and decide if I want to join them.<br /><br />Great integration and real easy to use plus it has a very active community (granted idiots posting there) allowing you to get tips and hints.<br />They also do giveaways regularly that include in-game items which is pretty cool IMO.<br /><br />I love seeing my stats and taunting my friends to improve or just talking shit to them about their skills.<br /><br />All in all a great program and not very resource intensive.<br /><br />I have over 400+ games in my library and so far I have only had to add game hours manually to a few because of game developer programming.<br />(BF3, Diablo 3 and a few others)<br /><br />Get It Now!
700	-1	I had Anytime Organizer 12 and I bought this because it had the ability to synchonize data between this product and my Google account.  I was also hoping that between 12 and 14 they would have fixed a bug that causes some entries in my address book to be sorted incorrectly.<br /><br />But the synchronization fails and the sorting bug is still there too.  So I basically spent 27 of me hard earned dollars for a whole lot of nothing.<br /><br />Thanks a lot!
701	-1	Connectify, the free version, sounds good, but it limits what one can do by shutting itself off after no great period of time.  It is invasive in that it constantly is trying to get one to update with pop-ups.  When uninstalled, it turns off the hosted-network capability of the computer, which is confusing for most mortals.  If you want an easy WiFi connection to your computer, try the free Virtual Router Plus.  It requires no installation, does not invade your screen with upgrade requests, and works for as long as you leave it on.  In short, Connectify is not worth it.
702	-1	Said it works on mac, total lie. Will not return purchase, even though never open download. Tried to cancel order within minutes of placing order.
703	0	have been using it for years and its been consistent. its not as flexible to navigate as i would like
704	-1	I have used desktop quickbooks payroll basic with my pro edition for a few years now. I wanted to break free from my desk and purchased the online value pack; QB essential & basic payroll 2015.  So this is where my nightmare begins.  First of all, instructions are like a One Size fits all garment.  It might fit you perfectly or you might look like a potato sack. If you do not buy this product from their website and/or you have previously purchased and activated a payroll product, you will be a potato sack like me.  I have intermediate-advanced computer skills and always find a way to make thing work.  I spent 2 hours trying to make my ill fitting potato sack fit me.  If you ever had an intuit account, the page will tell you that you do not have an active subscription and the page provides no information on how to activate your retail license.  Help links redirect you to the intuit community just to find unanswered user questions.  Chat is offline, don't bother.  Now you can email and wait a couple of days or call. Second, when I finally figured out how to activate the product and start filling company information it says that they do not offer payroll service for Puerto Rico.  I thought that it must be a mistake because I have been using their software and payroll for years even though it was a bumpy road to activate the license.  I think that they make it more difficult to activate products purchased from third parties, probably as punishment for cutting their profits. At this point my only option was to call support.  This is how it went: 15-20 wait time to speak to a representative.  I explained the problem and after 2 hours of being on hold, making me do nonsense stuff in their web page she said:  &#34;unfortunately payroll service it is not available for Puerto Rico, is there anything else I can do for you?&#34; WELL YOU DIDN'T HELP ME HELLO!!! She said she would call me back, still waiting.  I decided to call Sales, 'cause they should know better than anyone right? WRONG! I explained that this product is being sold in PR and I have used their desktop payroll.  She put me on hold twice and transferred me to another department because her resources were limited.  So, I explain AGAIN for the third time my problem.  And she offered to transfer me to another department because she was not able to help me because she could not resolve these specific situation.  I said there was no way I was going to explain my issue for the fourth time.  At this point I had been on the phone for 4 hours; irritated is an understatement. She offered to call and explain it for me so I agreed.  After 20 more minutes, the representative that answered did not know the problem so I had to explain it AGAIN after I waited so long.  Guess what? She offered to transfer me again! In summary, SUPPORT IS A FAILURE.  Third,  they are selling a product in a country where it cannot be used.  The product description does not provide country limitations.  That is the most dishonest and shameful thing of all.  Solution? Amazon's amazing customer service.  I explained my situation and in less than 10 minutes I was able to arrange a refund.  I hope this review may help you avoid becoming a potato sack.
705	-1	i wasted so much money on this i should have just went to the store... i really want my money back.
706	0	I've been using Norton Security in various forms since the late 1990s. In recent years, the product has been excellent, but the 2015 edition didn't work on one of my computers, causing serious problems.<br /><br />I believe that the trouble is caused by Norton combining two previously separate products: Norton Internet Security 2014 and another program, Norton 360, that was used by businesses.<br /><br />When I downloaded it to my Windows 7 computer, the installation was bumpy, but the program did eventually get itself installed and working well. I was surprised that the installation seemed to have problems, as I have had no difficulties with Norton products in years.<br /><br />I also needed to install it on my old Windows XP2 computer, that I have been nursing along, until I can replace it. Norton Security has always run fine on it, until this year. Even though the Norton publicity says the program will run on Windows XP systems, I recommend against downloading it into a Windows XP computer.<br /><br />When I tried to download the program onto my Windows XP2 computer, the program first refused to download, demanding that I upgrade to Windows XP3. That requirement wasn't mentioned in the Norton publicity I saw. I do not want to upgrade the old computer to Windows XP3 from XP2, because I did that with another computer years ago, and the upgrade ruined the computer.<br /><br />I called Norton tech support, and a tech altered something in the registry, so that the Norton program would recognize my computer as an XP3, even though it is not. The program then downloaded, but I ran into new problems. The program refused to recognize my code that showed I had legitimately purchased the program. Since I had bought it on Amazon, that was pretty irritating.<br /><br />I called Norton tech support again, and they used their remote entry program to enter my computer and force the program to recognize the code. However, the program kept insisting that I hadn't bought it, and that my &#34;trial subscription&#34; had ended.<br /><br />I again called Norton tech support, and they used a remote entry program to try to fix this. A new problem developed. Their remote entry tech support program didn't like my home computer network, and kept severing the connection between my computer and the Norton tech, leaving the screen showing the conversation between me and the Norton tech on my computer's screen.<br /><br />The entire situation turned into a 12-hour nightmare, in which several different techs could not fix any of the problems, and they then inadvertently created more problems.<br /><br />I finally got a tech who was able to remove the Norton remote connection program from my computer and its screen. (I discovered through a search on my other computer that the program Norton currently uses for remote entry assistance is defective and sometimes operates like malware, leading to situations where it is difficult to remove from a customer's computer.)<br /><br />However, two subsequent Norton techs could not convince my computer that I had paid for the program, and it would not run on my Windows XP2 program.<br /><br />I have to say that Norton tech support tried really hard to resolve the problem, but I gave up after 12 hours. I removed Norton Security from the computer, and installed a free antivirus instead. It doesn't run well, but at least my old Windows XP2 computer is protected, until I can replaced it with a Windows 7 computer.
707	-1	This new version is a total joke compared to my old Quicken Family Lawyer 2000, which will not run on Windows 8. Makes papers that look like kindergarten kids made them instead of professional ones made by the old 2000 software. The forms cannot be altered to make necessary adjustments for situations.  Will be keeping my old computer just to run the 2000 version which I can transfer to Word or other to finish. The new version is a waste of money!
708	1	Thanks Amazon!!! Norton & everywhere were very expensive this year for this. Thanks for coming thru for a sister on a budget~
709	1	Very very good program but I could have gotten the same value from the Basic version for this specific use.
710	1	Great protection from avast! You should give it a try, download & install, and you will see how great it is.
711	0	Intuit has forced an upgrade from the stable 2007 version to this unstable, exceptional slow version.<br /><br />After entering a transaction and clicking save, it take 7-8 seconds before the cursor reappears!  Imagine entering a hundred transactions with a forced 8 second delay between them!  This is really sad.<br /><br />Maybe I should inquire about downgrading to the 2012 version?<br /><br />*** Update on March 10, 2013 ***<br />Quicken support suggested a two step, hour long process to validate and correct my large Quicken data file.  After this process, posting a change to a transaction only takes 1 second before the cursor becomes available to work on the next transaction.  Not as quick at the 2007 version, but better than it was.  Turning off the count of how many times a Category has been used now results in the Category list being displayed in 8 seconds.<br /><br />I should add I am running Win 7 32x on a several year old laptop with an Intel Core Due 1.67 GHz with 4G RAM.  A more recent computer would give faster results.<br /><br />I upgraded the review from one star to three.  It works, but I'm not very happy.
712	-1	Download a trial version first, to make sure this product works for you. I have tested WinX DVD Copy Pro, with windows 8.1 on a newer computer system, and time and time again the copy it creates, the frame rate gitters.. the copy stops and then goes again on almost every conversion. It allows a mpeg download and other types of downloads that are pretty well useless, no mvk, avi, wmv, or any major conversions are even available.
713	0	I had to purchase this for work. So far I haven't needed to do much with it, but no complaints.
714	0	The current Quicken 2014 does not allow me to sync Regions Bank with the Quicken cloud. Works fine with USAA and others but not Regions. Other than that the software seems fine. Latest update fixed a bunch of stuff.
715	0	I usually do my taxes with Turbo Tax without any major problems. Yesterday, I downloaded the program and it says it cannot import any of last years info because it cannot find my file. That is disappointing because I did my taxes with Turbo Tax and now I am going to have to enter my last year's info all over again. That has to be a glitch in the system, very aggravating.
716	0	The personal software works at a 5 star level.<br /><br />Business software works, but you have to be vigilant, and know what you're doing on some level. This was my first year using the CA state forms, and the software generated a lot of forms that were unnecessary, and kept flagging my corporation's # with the Sec of State as being incorrect. Software could be cleaned up a bit so the check boxes in the interview aren't mis-aligned.<br /><br />But generally it does the job, saves me from paying an accountant for a fairly straight-forward return, and gets me where I need to go.
717	1	Great product.  No problems with the download or installation.  So far has worked just fine.  I took advantage of my points to make the purchase very affordable, compared to buying in the store.
718	0	I like the program but found that you need to save two copies of everything.  It seems that it is a little buggy and after sometime something appears on the design that once that shows up you it starts getting all messed up.  If you see something coming down like a beam from the corner then don't save your work at that point or it will mess up.  I called the company and they were glad to help me if they thought I didn't understand it or it was something they could help me correct.  After I said I thought it was something in the program I never heard from them again.
719	1	Works well. Great that you can load your Itunes playlist directly into the program.
720	0	Good but not as friendly for the user as Dropbox. I appreciate that you have a OSX application not just for iOS
721	1	easy to down load.  easy to use. helps me to brush up on my typing.
722	1	I found help in a box.  I had suddenly gone from just having bank accounts to owning a portfolio and investments. I can up-date and get a good look at what my assets are doing.  Reminders will reduce my stress and keep me in A one financial shape!  Thank you Quicken.
723	-1	Intuit has reached new lows for Customer Service, I plan on asking for a refund. Install went normally but Q 2015 could not read my data file. Message said to call customer service. Barely understandable foreign tech checked out my machine and said I needed to subscribe to a support plan to get it fixed! I refused and he rudely asked me to hang up. Was suspicious of Intuit after finding out that they had removed support for some forms in the Deluxe version of Turbo Tax for this year. It forced you into buying the &#34;Premier&#34; version to support forms previously included in the &#34;Deluxe&#34; version. If you feel that you need this product make sure you backup your data file to an external storage device as I did. I was able to get it to work following a fix posted on the Quicken site. However I consider myself an above average PC user. The fix required renaming hidden folders, removing the original install and running a program to &#34;clean&#34; your machine. Best part is that if you do ask for a refund and remove it you will have wiped out the version you had that was working fine...Makes me very happy that I replaced Turbo Tax with H&R Block, working fine so far and it's less expensive.
724	-1	"- i just read the 1-star post down below by the attorney mark Twain (titled something like:  You Must Read this Review by a Tax Attorney) that i have seen on all three tt deluxe products, and want to add the following comment stating that mark twain makes good points that i have definitely experienced too.  i checked what he said out, and yes, the irs is actually making free online forms available for all filers this year at their website, regardless of one's income, just as he says.  i didn't know the irs was doing this!  you can find the link at the irs main home page under \\""free file\\"" on the left side of their web page . . . after selecting that, then click on the \\""choose fillable forms\\"" button at the bottom of the page.  of course, you have to input your own numbers and follow the irs paper instructions, but i am going to do it this year because it is FREE and saves me a bunch of dough when money is tight.  for most people i find it is pretty easy anyway to do your own taxes on a 1040 with a couple of the schedules.  (plus, if you spend a day this year learning your basic forms, then you can easily replicate it in future years and save every year going forward.)  so, like a lot of turbotax users, the ONLY reason i used the tt deluxe software was for the spreadsheet aspects that saved me a bunch of time re-calculating numbers if i later made a change to a form . . . but now that the irs is doing it's own online spreadsheets for free, i am totally excited that i do not have to shell out cash again and go through these software bugs and legal mistakes that the attorney's post talks about.  plus, i avoid having to amend my taxes like these other folks had to here, and i save all the time not having to figure out all the bugs and quirks each year in tt's software.  thank god.  and for people with more complicated returns who know a little about taxes, i imagine they would have no problem using the free irs website, because these folks have to do a lot by hand anywaysbecause tt provides very little guidance other than on the most basic stuff.  i really wonder why the irs didn't publicize their website more????      p.s. by the way, tt's \\""It's Deductible\\"" program in all these deluxe products is a non-selling point and puts way too low values on your donations.  go to E-bay instead and use your own values when you do your deductions at the free irs website."
725	0	I bought this out of desperation.  I have had Print Shop for years.  Version 23 won't work on Windows 8.  This is adequate.  It is hard to use but it gets the job done. I was going to try Microsoft Publisher but it was too expensive.<br /><br />I like to print banners.  I wish they would quit changing how things work.  If you stick with the four page banner they offer, you can make it work.  The graphics aren't as nice as they used to be.  They seem dumbed down.  The print quality is much lower than version 23.<br /><br />Sigh...
726	-1	1st time doing tax return myself and I've done OK with this program. However, the surprise came at the very end when I was ready to e file and was forced to pay $19.95 for state return! So buyer be aware of this hidden fee.<br /><br />Update: As it turns out, after paying $19.95 to be able to e-file State return, you get nothing! You'll still have to printout certain forms and sent them in along with a payment check yourself! I spent hours trying to resolved this issue with them today only to learn that there was nothing they can do for me. They even had the gall to direct me to a 3rd party payment website that charges fees to pay electronically!<br /><br />SHAME ON YOU H&R FOR STOOPING SO LOW!
727	0	The advertisement for this program is good.<br /><br />One would think that it is really easy, but in reality it is not.  Even with online tutorials, it is not that easy to follow.<br /><br />My great hope is that with Debut 11 comes out, I will have fully learning Debut 10.
728	0	I was able to successfully import my Quicken Basic 2006 data files into 2012 Starter without a problem. I cannot vouch for data connections to online banks as I do not use that feature, preferring to enter transactions manually. Nor do I use it to track investments or taxes. I do like the fact that the data file is now a single file and that backing up a file overwrites the previous backup. The old version would create a new file for every backup, creating massive file proliferation.
729	1	Just started working on the taxes. Got this version to help with some investment losses this year. So far so good. This is a good way to do taxes.
730	-1	Didn't function.  Had to call support.  Then had to upgrade.  Brought taxes into office for the advertised second look and the reviewer came up with different numbers.  They the tried to up sell again!
731	-1	I am giving this a poor rating because I downloaded this in November 2012 and in March of 2013 it says I need to renew already. There is something wrong with this download.
732	0	The 2013 version installed and ran fine. However the main reason that I wanted it was for the mobile app feature. This was not quite done so it required 2 updates. The update process was a little clunky but it did get there. Now the product works very nicely.
733	0	I haven't noticed any big improvements over the last release. Not sure why a new release was needed except to make more money. I have used Quicken for my personal finances for decades, literally, and I like it a lot, but I just don't understand the need for 2014.
734	-1	This program is a POC relative to the PC versions of Quicken.  I want a refund.  I'll keep my old laptop active just for Quicken until there is a decent Mac version of this program.
735	0	While Quicken performs adequately, I find that the reporting function leaves something to be desired, and it requires too much effort to put out a complete report.  Often it does not seem possible to get a complete report.  I am quite proficient with reports from other software, and Quicken should have a better system.  I am still trying to figure out how to record my investments.<br /><br />Other than that, my daily recording of checkbook information is very good.
736	0	"I have used Quicken for many, many years; I have used it extensively and am a strong supporter of it.  However, Quicken 2014 has come up with some new deficiencies and continues deficiencies noted in the past that have continued to frustrate me:<br /><br />o  2014 Quicken:<br /><br />  -  I can no longer designate in \\""Categories\\"" where I want loan interest to go; Quicken demands I use \\""Loan: interest\\"" - I wish to continue to establish a unique \\""Category\\"" for each loan.  And what happened to the simple loan button - I now need to know to go to the \\""Account\\"" section to find where to open a new loan - in fact, finding and using loan (and other categories of!) data is no longer either easy nor straightforward (it seems to me that Quicken is perhaps moving away from being useful and understandable to the non-accountant.  Perhaps the data-development people have simply forgotten to put themselves in our shoes as they trapse around in the Quicken program!).<br />  -  \\""Register\\"" balancing has developed quirks.<br />  -  My perception is that Quicken is unstable and slower.<br />  -  I like the \\""Calculation\\"" change that puts the value to be acted upon in the \\""Calculation\\"" box - handy!<br /><br />o  General:<br /><br />  -  I want to have \\""Reference\\"" entries available to be listed and saved for all \\""Registers\\"".<br />  -  Stop returning to the top of each report when a change is made - or leave the choice to me.<br />  -  Quicken is SLOW coming up - Quicken is a main reason I use the not otherwise as useful \\""sleep\\"" mode!<br />  -  Let me set up \\""Categories\\"" to reflect my accounting setup and to act as a useful breakdown for \\""Reports\\"", rather than simply alphabetizing them - Quicken's approach has always been a significant restriction!  This is not to detract from the tremendous improvements Quicken has made through the years to the \\""Categories\\"" concept, but this is an important capability!<br />  -  I use \\""Scheduled Transactions\\"" (and the \\""Register\\"") as a beautiful way to budget EASILY AND IN DETAIL three months (or for any other period, as needed) into the future; and I have developed coding techniques using the \\""Reference\\"" column to describe and control entries as I do this - I find this far superior to Quicken's Budget section and recommend you consider this for an ALTERNATIVE budgeting approach as you develop Quicken capabilities.  Like \\""Categories\\"" and \\""Tags\\"" [a dumb title!], a VERY USEFUL capability!!"
737	1	Great price and very easy to use.  Used to pay much more to have taxes done.
738	-1	I tried over and over to insert a blank screen, but not successful.  I left the app alone until I can revisit Wondershare.
739	1	I am new to Windows 8 so that learning hurdle is still getting perfecting. My old version of Quicken would not work with it so had to get Quicken 2013.  I love quicken - have used it for years.  The only thing so far I am having trouble with is hitting return to enter info and it automatically inserts the transaction- oops- I wasn't finished and sometimes it puts in data I don't want so I have to go back and correct.  Be sure to TAB!! until ready to complete.
740	1	Best in its class protection. Best in all class protection. Enough said.
741	-1	Locked me out of windows 8
742	0	The Business part of this software continues to have the same problems as the 2012 version.  That is that the fields, e.g. check boxes, radio buttons, and fill-in fields do not line up with the text that describes them.  This is very poor programming.... Why does H&R Block pay so little attention to detail?  Most of the time, I can figure out which field to use - but sometimes the text describing the fields overlays some of the fields...  It's ridiculous.  But so far I have not found another package that includes all the forms for both home and business that I need.
743	-1	I have been a Quicken user since the DOS 1.0 version, when it was utterly fantastic, and Quicken *used* to get better and faster with each release. Over the years Intuit has continuously added features... and BUGS. Capital B-U-G-S. Some of the bugs are so blatant and so severely affect usability that I seriously wonder if they have a QA department at all, or if they do, why they can't find even simple bugs, or perhaps why the bugs they do find don't get fixed... Good engineers don't let code this sloppy get into the product.<br /><br />I realize Quicken is a complex product, but that puts an even stronger imperative on providing a working product, since the average user relies on the software to manage the complexity. Considering we are talking about people's financial information, I am very surprised there haven't been numerous class action lawsuits against Intuit for this disaster.<br /><br />The fancy features are pointless if the basic product functionality trips over itself again and again. Quicken may look good on paper, but it doesn't deliver on the promises. It will only make your life miserable. If they GAVE it away, I wouldn't touch it...
744	0	I'm a relatively new user to this program, so this isn't a definitive review but rather a &#34;first impressions&#34;.  There seems to be a lot to like in terms of features, capabilities, and quality of results. But it's really, really hard to get past just how clunky the user interface is. Some examples:  1) This is really a program for working on a single image. Although it does include a &#34;browser&#34; that lets you pick the image to be edited from a folder, the browser is slow and doesn't really add any value.  2) For Raw files, first you pick the white balance setting, then you open the file. If you don't like the result, you close the file, pick another white balance setting, then reopen the file. Repeat until you're mostly happy. Virtually every other editing program lets you adjust the white balance while you're seeing how it affects the image. Almost every other editing program gives you an &#34;eyedropper&#34; you can use on a neutral point in the image to set the white balance, but not this one. Also, white balance is purely color temperature, with no ability to adjust the magenta/green axis.  3) There is no Undo. This is a non-destructive editor, so it's certainly possible to go back and reset things by hand as long as you remember how they used to be set, but a lot of times it's just easier to hit CTRL-Z to undo a mistake or an experiment. Not here. CTRL-Z takes you to the last &#34;restore point&#34; you create by hitting SHIFT-Z. If you haven't created a restore point, CTRL-Z has no effect.  4) You always have to start from one of the presets. You can create your own Custom preset that has no initial effect and use that as a starting point, but should that really be necessary to do?  5) Before/after comparison is limited to a small window with a movable divider. That's not unheard-of, but most editors provide a button you can press to momentarily show the Before image.  6) There's no preview for the &#34;effects&#34; (the adjustment layers that make the changes). To see if you want to use a particular effect, you have to add it and then, if you didn't want it, you delete it. Deleting an effect always requires clicking &#34;Yes&#34; on a confirmation dialog and there's no way to turn off that confirmation. Since there are 85 effects to choose from, this gets old really fast.  7) Cropping is only available during saving. Cropping is completely free-form and by eye; there are no presets for particular aspect ratios, no way to set a specific crop size, and no way to determine what pixel sizes you're cropping to.  For the photographer who just wants to make his pictures look &#34;true to life&#34; or &#34;slightly better than real life,&#34; there's not much here that isn't available in more established products that have a much more pleasant user interface. Also, as the name suggests, Franzis COLOR Projects provides only minimal capabilities for producing black-and-white images (Franzis offers two other programs for that purpose).  The creative, especially the professional creative tasked with producing color images that project a particular ambiance, flair, or emotional impact, might well find Franzis COLOR Projects to be worth the hassle. It's capable of an incredibly wide range of creative &#34;looks,&#34; and those looks seem to be very nicely done. Learning one's way around the 85 effects and their respective controls, 84 preset settings, and 35 color-film emulations is going to take a fair amount of time and dedication.
745	1	Very easy to use, like it better than PS Elements.
746	0	while downloading transactions I used to be able to go to a different page on quicken, now I have to wait for the download to finish
747	-1	Software closes whenever it feels, often and generally buggy in multiple ways..  reconciling with no data to clear adjusts incorrectly.  Not much change from 2013...not worth it.  If there is one software I want 'perfect' it is my FINANCIAL one and this one does NOT give me any warm and fuzzies!  What happened to Quality control?
748	-1	I am one of the original Quicken users.  I've been using Quicken so long without trouble<br />that I can't remember when I started.  I was one of the Beta Testers  for First Jersey Bank<br />(now Wells Fargo).  This latest version is so bad that I'm on the verge of starting a law suit for<br />mental anguish..  ( I have 3 children who are lawyers)  I've been trying for over 2 months to download<br />my savings account from Hudson City Savings Bank.  I have been trying for the last 3 weeks to download,<br />more than one day in a row,, my accounts from Wells Fargo.  The support is horrible.  Each of my last 3 calls<br /> has lasted over an hour, with me patiently putting up with people with horrible accents who<br />will insist on treating me like a first time user.  I'm 73 years old and started using computers in1960.
749	0	I switched from MD to quicken recently because MD kept breaking things every time they came out with an update.  I had switched away from Quicken many years ago because the Mac version was so unbelievably bad.  But things have gotten better and I now use Windows so I can use the better version.  The graphing/plotting functionality needs a lot of work (just adding the ability to do a simple line plot over time with lines for multiple categories would be a HUGE improvement), but it is cumbersome to use and doesn't do some of the most basic types of plots.  Also, the integration between the online bill pay and the rest of the program is very strange.  It requires going into a separate online window in which the functions are oddly broken up into menus and tabs sort of randomly.  Definitely some interface work needed there.  Also, I was using OFX with MD before and the bill pay checks were issued by my bank the next day.  Going through Quicken as the middleman rather than direct OFX makes it take 3 days between when I pay the bill with Quicken and the bank generates the check.  VERY annoying.  But overall, Quicken is still the most solid product out there with the best general online integration with financial institutions available.  Quicken also forces you to upgrade every 3 years by turning off the online banking functions ov any version that is more than 3 years old.  Lots of people don't like this, but I think it's perfectly fair to ask me to buy a new version every 3 years.
750	1	This is the ONLY anti-virus I will use; great product
751	0	I've used the TT product for 14 years or so, this year I had problems with it not importing information into worksheets even though it was imported correctly on the main forms.  Also, it did not transfer the information correctly to the state return, I had to wait for 2 updates and after deleting both issues went away.  I didn't feel as confident in what I was filing this year just do to the problems.  However, I'm thinking that most of the issues were probably due to the congressional idiots waiting until the last minute to finalize things causing Intuit and other Companies like it to attempt to get things into the program as quickly as possible.  I'll give it a go again next year as this is really the first year I've encountered any real problems.
752	-1	I bought this software to use on a Windows 8 computer. It was advertised on Amazon as compatible with Windows Vista / 7 / 8 / 2000 / XP, but when I tried to install it on a computer with Windows 8.1, the installation program refused to install, with a pop-up window saying that it was not yet compatible with Windows 8.  The installation program then terminated.  I contacted Amazon with this information, but their representative said it was possibly due to my security software blocking the download. It downloaded just fine, but refuses to install in Windows 8.  So now I'm stuck with a program that refuses to run in Windows 8, and I can't return it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon refunded my money in full after I showed their rep that it really was incompatible with Windows 8. Kudos to Amazon on their great customer support!!
753	1	This is a great antivirus program.  I have been using the Norton product for a few years and plan to continue.<br />Now they have it available for one device which is exactly what I need for my use.  The price is very reasonable.<br />Downloading and installing the software was very straight forward even for this novice PC user.  I highly recommend purchasing this software.
754	-1	I pretty much consider Norton a virus in its own right....I'm constantly amazed at how many reminders I get to update within weeks of installing.  Big pain.  But seems like my system never runs as well without it and often seems to go downhill if I let a subscription run out....leading me to feel it's its own form of virus.  Waddaya gonna do?  I hate it.  But I hate being without it more.  That's how they get ya.
755	0	More difficult to use than TurboTax, though much less expensive.  Difficult to fill in the forms in the fashion I knew how to fill them in - had to go through their interview process.  Still, much cheaper than TurboTax.
756	-1	I used to use Onenote a great deal. Now, it is so crazily put together that I cannot use the program at all on my home computer. I keep attempting to send articles to Onenote and the articles disappear somewhere. I am really disgusted with Microsoft. The older version of the Microsoft at least was put together logically. Microsoft seems to be run by a bunch of idiots who are thrilled with their own crazy way of doing things.
757	0	For the most part, QB's payroll is easy to use. It's the setup that is difficult and confusing. It took a 3 hour conversation with a man that I could barely understand to get up and running. It also needs better direction with submitting tax payments and forms. Half the time, I am guessing and hoping that I am setting up submitting everything correctly. I guess the IRS will let me know?
758	0	I have used Turbo Tax for several years.  It walks you through every step.  My only complaint is last year and this year the State forms are not updated.  I am still waiting to file this years state return.  When I print he has DO NOT FILE, FORM NOT FINAL, printed over top of it.  I wish these things could be fixed sooner!
759	1	Easy to use. Steps you thru each category. Shows you where to find information to answer all questions. Explains items you need more help with.
760	0	I bought this version because it was reviewed to clear up a problem the Quicken had on 2014 when trying to run it on a Yoga 2 pro.<br />My yoga has a hidpi screen and 2014 sucked.  This was not good. I could have went back a year but Quicken should have fixed the<br />problem in 2014 version. They blamed MSoft for the problem but this version fixed it. So how was this MSofts' problem.  I am still running Windows 8.  This will probably be the last time I upgrade for a while.  This version has caused me some problems when syncing to the cloud.  So now I won't sync to the cloud.  Not a whole lot else has changed. A more viable early release than 2014. Thanks to the reviewer that told of the updated hi dpi feature.
761	1	Am very pleased with this antivirus protections.  Do have a problem with a notice I keep getting about registering my license number, being told it is already registered, and the notice keeps appearing to register.  A bit annoying.
762	-1	Since I downloaded Norton from Internet I  always have problems with the computer . Last week  Microsoft office stop working. A technician, who helped me to reinstall the program, explained me, that my computer is infected . He helped me to clean up the system and reinstall office. I afraid to reinstall Norton, which I bought through the Amazon. What do you think? Did I buy real Norton?
763	-1	Bought this for a great deal from Amazon. Since I work in a different State from the State I live in, I had to buy an additional State program for almost twice the price that I paid for this software. At the time, I figured it was not a big deal since I bought this software at a great price. This all changed when I found out that I could only e-file one state return and I would have to mail in the other. Upon contacting support, they were unable to help me and in the end the resolution was that e-filing multiple states was just not supported. I might switch back to Turbo Tax next year.
764	1	I think this is the best product out there for practicing with kana - at least the best I've found - and I was happy to be able to download & start using it immediately.
765	1	I've used Turbo Tax for the past 7 or more years and did so again this year to file my husband's and my tax returns as well as my mother's return.. However, I ended up having to pay a CPA to help me with filing my mother's last tax returns due to having to use both 1040 as well as 1041. In addition, in years pass when I filed my mother's tax return I always filed it via efile but this year it was rejected. So I had to return to the CPA to file what should have been a simple procedure in hopes of bringing to an close my mother's returns. Each year, tax laws change and so does how the Turbo Tax program seems to be used. Frustrating to say the least.
766	-1	I've used TTax since the olde days of floppy disks. every year they &#34;improved&#34; the interface and made me a learn a new one. OK. But now I see that they are splitting off sections of the return and making you pay more if you do such common items as own stock, or do a small business (aka schedule C).  After tearing my hair out reading their info both on amazon and at the intuit site I finally broke down and called them.<br /><br />All I wanted to know was if I could access schedule C through the 'forms' tab on either deluxe or premier. Sadly for their operator I don't think anyone had ever trained her anything about the product or tax software. IN theory I could get access to a hobbled down version of schedule C to be used for &#34;minimal&#34; income. What is minimal I asked?&#62; $5, $50, $500, $5,000?  She did not know. I asked for a supervisor. She checked and of course no one could talk to me but the supervisor did not know either.<br /><br />I pointed out that schedule C is a standard 4 page form everyone uses. If they do the code for it for their expensive version (which used to be included in the simple version), they have to Pay someone extra to write the code to hamper it- but then they charge less for a product that cost them more to make.<br /><br />I have never seen a company that wants to go out of business the war Intuit does. The money they spend on trying to explain all the differences between versions must be immense, yet they continue to produce a watered down product, charge us more for it, and drive away customers. Does the CEO have a clue as to what is going on? Or does he just want a solid gold helicopter before the company crashes and burns?<br /><br />So after my request for info, and then my complaint, she says she will just give me the expensive version for free (rather than find out the answer). She says next time I log on to my intuit account I can download it.<br /><br />Guess what?!?!  Yep. its not there.
767	1	Thank you AVAST for free antivirus, its been so many years I'm using this antivirus AVAST i have old laptop acer using this antivirus ,now inhave new Toshiba need also antivirus searching AVAST. To install my new laptop. I prove it for so many  years  I used I like it . when you search we have a lot pup up in my laptop if you click  that the virus. If you have AVAST your gadget protected for any kind of virus
768	-1	Even some years after Microsoft quite supporting Microsoft Money, it (Microsoft Money Plus) is still a better product than Quicken Home & Business 2014.
769	1	I have chosen to use Kaspersky for years.  I installed Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) 2015 shortly before installing the new Windows version 10.  When I updated Windows, KIS displayed a message saying it protects you in the Windows 10 operating system.  Later I tried the KIS Safe Money feature that isolates your browser when you are at financial web sites.  I was disappointed to find that it did not activate in the Windows 10 browser, Microsoft Edge.  I discovered that Safe Money still works in my old Internet Explorer browser.  From a web site in Edge, it's easy to switch to the same site in the old browser, just two clicks.  KIS customer service told me they are working on an update.
770	0	My review of the software is positive. It seems to work just fine. I can't review the backup as I use other backup software. I need more than 5 seats that is why I purchased the one with backup. I never intended to use the Norton backup. My complaint is with Norton advertising. They claim it will install on Windows XP and newer versions of Windows. No place on there website did it say that for it to run on XP you need to have SP3 (service pack 3) install which I never install because SP3 had issues and cause conflict problems You can no longer get XP support from Microsoft but I did manage to find a free download on the internet. I have 3 machines running XP so I did the SP3 install. 2 machines had minor issues and Norton installed ok. The 3 one Norton would not install because it did not support the Intel processor in my older laptop. Something else that Norton did not note was some older processors will not allow it to install. My processor is over 12 years old so I will give the that one  but they should have mentioned it so I could have called them to check on it before buying. I have not tried installing on my Samsung Tablet yet. I would buy this product again but only the one without the backup because now I only need 5 seats. I do recommend this product but Norton needs to give more system info. I would give the software 5 stars but Norton only gets 3!!<br />DMD
771	0	I bought this after trying the new Mac 2015 version.  This is still miles ahead of the Mac version.  It's not great.  It has problems like this extremely annoying pop up system that forces you to click repeatedly on little balloons.  The forums are full of people trying to get rid of this horrible feature.  Intuit knows about it, but doesn't provide any option to turn it off.  The pop ups are so annoying it's tempting to uninstall and go back to old version, but that has its own problems.  Intuit pretty much quit listening to any feedback as you can tell from any of the forums or help groups.  But, despite being clunky and not user friendly at all, this is the only game in town that provides full functionality.  It beats Quicken for Mac 2015 hands down, for what that's saying.
772	0	good
773	0	It was easy, asked me all the right questions and did what I needed. The big flaw. When I finished Federal, it said are your ready to file your free State return. You have one free state return. Are you ready to use it.  I said yes, but when finished, it wanted to bill me for state return, so I did not file state return via Turbo tax.
774	-1	They goof this thing up every time they have a new release.  They make you buy it every 3 years under the guise that they can't support the old download format.  This is complete poppycock.  I work for a bank.  We haven't changed our Direct Connect in 10 years.<br /><br />No new useful features.  Just more bloat and cost.  Unfortunately I'm stuck with them due to the enormous history in my database.
775	-1	I liked this, as it made me feel like I was being safe. The green checks by websites on google. But when I was trying to go to a website I knew to be okay, just a plain ole internet forum, it would block me. I checked the box saying I knew the site, and proceed, it would send me to an ad page. I turned it off, it still blocked me. I sent it to trash, it's still blocking me. Trying to remove it from my machine is impossible. Seems to be a virus, itself.<br /><br />Update: I thought I had it all deleted. Then, this morning it's icon is back on my tool bar, vigilantly protecting me from a carpentry forum. I can't wait to see the thing they'll sell me for a hundred bucks to remove it.
776	1	Use it every year, best software out there.
777	-1	I really want to like Quicken every year.  I updated from 2013 to 2015.  The mobile experience had stopped working in 2013 despite hours of back and forth with Intuit and repeated &#34;delete, uninstall, re-install, re-create, etc&#34; processes.  2015 fixed the mobile experience.  The desktop experience got worse.  The application is MUCH slower.  It takes several (up to 10) seconds to switch between accounts or screens.  There is a constant paint, re-paint, refresh process going on that no other application on my computer does nor did Quicken 2013.  My budget got messed up during the transition (no big deal as its a good idea to refresh that thing every once in a while anyway) and all of my accounts had a slight (a few dollars / cents) balance adjustment needed after the upgrade (this is stupid for a financial accounting piece of software but manageable.)  I'm hoping an update fixes the speed issue.  This is the thing that will make me return this in 55 more days.
778	-1	With each new release, another shovel of &#34;features&#34; are added.  The user interface is cluttered and even simple tasks require multiple clicks.  The menu has been &#34;redesigned&#34;, commands renamed and relocated, adding to the confusion.  I've been a Quicken user since the DOS versions, but Intuit is churning out software inspired by Windows 8 and ME.  The lack of a manual is crippling, and the online Help is minimally interactive (no ability to type in the topic you want to search for, you must just choose from the list of topics that they have provided).<br /><br />Overall, the design seems to be similar to the old VCR units that constantly flashed &#34;12:00&#34; because of the terrible user interface designed by programmers that were entirely ignorant of the customer's needs.
779	0	The look and feel of the 2013 version in the checking and savings accounts is pretty much the same as the older versions.  However, the handling of the loan portions of my accounts comes up with a graph and very little of the transaction ledger portion.  This makes it dificult to scroll through the register portion and review transactions to check for any errors or duplications.  In addition there is a slot at the top right corner that looks like a search portion but caused a major error in one of my registers.  Not sure how to correct it.  Hate to use the automatic adjustment feature for the correction.
780	0	I had an earlier version of HDI and upgraded my computer to Windows 7 OS. the earlier version wouldn't work with the new OS. Spent time with HDI support to figure out-there was no way to make it work.<br /><br />Downloaded this software. Saw it required Open GL 2.1. Husband checked my PC. Said it supported Open GL. Bought the software. Didn't work. Support said upgrade the drivers. Husband did. Still didn't work. Support said that was all that could be done. Still doesn't work on my PC.<br /><br />It does work on my husbands PC. When it works, it works well.<br /><br />If you have a computer that is a few years old, you should be cautious about purchasing this application. My husband is a geek and found that my PC supported Open GL but couldn't find the release number (2.1?). Support couldn't help to find out if my computer should support it. Unless your computer is new, be careful about buying this.
781	0	This version works well, as have all the previous versions. Intuit's pretty clever forcing one to upgrade about every three years in order to keep using online bill pay.
782	-1	Forewarned by abysmal ratings on Amazon, but optimistic that by now (December 30, 2013) Quicken Premier (QP) 2014 would be functioning properly, I downloaded it to a computer which didn't have Quicken on it at all, in case there was trouble. I've been a Quicken User since 1993, and have upgraded every year. QP 2013 was the worst version before 2014 came out, and it took Intuit eight revisions for the 2013 version to get it functioning by the end of 2012 (it's presently had 12 revisions). QP 2014's debut seems to have set a new low in both competence and professionalism.<br /><br />Two days ago (a Saturday), figuring that surely after getting feedback and having some Intuit ghost, &#34;Kathryn,&#34; putting canned messages on the hundreds of complaints about QP 2014 (and other Quicken 2014 software) that things were fixed, or would be forwarded to something called a &#34;development team&#34; (a development team? Now? Why not have a development team before the product was released to an unsuspecting public?), I downloaded it and found that it updated itself to Revision 5 and converted my QP 2013 files--an unfortunate habit Quicken has of making it as difficult and inconvenient as possible by seeing to it that prior versions won't work with data files of succeeding versions.<br /><br />When conversion was complete, the first thing I noticed was that the toolbar only had four or five of the functions I had set up in QP 2013. I had added a number of specialized reports I designed for doing taxes, and none were on the toolbar. Neither was the calendar icon there, which I found particularly baffling. There were no alerts indicated, and when I called up the calendar by alternate means, I found that not a single item was on it. It was blank through the end of 2014, despite my QP 2013 calendar being full of dates for medical appointments, birthdays, anniversaries, tax events, and other things. There was nothing before 2014 either, leaving me with no references for future orpast occasions and activities. QP 2014 apparently ignored what was in my QP 2013 version calendar.<br /><br />Next, I downloaded transactions for my checking account and two credit cards. The download seemed to be going all right, but when it finished, I was aghast. My checking account had mushroomed to $63,000 (would that I did indeed have that kind of balance!), and there was a message saying that &#34;my bank&#34; had told Quicken that there were more transactions, but they were unavailable because I had waited so long to update. As a matter of fact, I reconcile my accounts nearly every day, and all had been reconciled just the day before. Hundreds of transactions downloaded to my checking account, none with categories, even though all my transactions were recorded, with categories, in QP 2013. The two credit card accounts were much the same. Transactions up the ying-yang, no categories, and incorrect balances.<br /><br />I have little doubt that there were other things that weren't correct, but at that point, I'd had enough. I was not about to amuse a bunch of Intuit programming clerks by researching and correcting their incomplete, inaccurate, and invalid financial transactions, nor was I going to re-enter everything into the blank calendar for both future and past years, nor was I going to hunt for other possible errors and dysfunction. They may not think my time is valuable, but I do. I don't know how such DNA gets into the human gene pool to pollute it in the first place, or why anyone would want to hire it, but whoever is responsible for this thing that's called a 2014 financial management program should be dealt with. I dealt with them by removing QP 2014 from the computer to which I had downloaded it, and went back to QP 2013, which was on my other computer (and which still worked, mercifully enough!).<br /><br />I intend to get my money back from Intuit (I had purchased it from them through a special offer linked to their current TurboTax program, whichI use each year; the price was less than Amazon's). I might share with fellow QP 2014 purchasers though that even getting a refund shows an incompetence and unprofessionalism almost without parallel, in my experience. When I went back to my account and called up my order, there was a &#34;refund&#34; box,&#34; but I couldn't put a checkmark in it. A message said to call Intuit, which I did this (Monday) morning, as soon as they opened. I got a rather snippy robo-voice when I selected the &#34;for Quicken press three,&#34; telling me to go to a website, get a telephone number, and call that. What a bunch of nincompoops!<br /><br />Okay, I went to the website, and never did find other numbers to call. I'm happy to report that, after a lot of experimenting with un-&#34;intuit&#34;-ive screens, I finally was able to find a place, well-hidden, it seemed, to request a refund. I clicked &#34;submit,&#34; and was told that I'd receive an e-mail. I did receive one promptly, but it said that I'd recently had a &#34;conversation&#34; with someone, and that the conversation was summarized below. There was nothing summarized below or anywhere else in the e-mail. I have an &#34;incident&#34; number, which suggests that someone things I asked for technical support, and I don't have a clue as to whether Intuit knows I've requested a refund or, if so, when I might request it. Of particular interest, nowhere was I asked why I wanted a refund. Is it possible that they don't want to know? Don't care? Have a failed business model?<br /><br />That's my experience, and I just hope before my three-year period or being able to use QP 2013 is up, a firm which cares about excellence and customers will put out a good financial management software product. Intuit, its Quicken programming clerks, and its management no longer seem to have the will, expertise, or oversight to serve what should be a lucrative market. I imagine that the founder must be spinning in his grave, because when the companywas started, the situation I've described here, and the same or worse situation hundreds of others have shared on Amazon just this year alone, would not have been tolerated. As many people have noted, the Quicken line of products have been stagnating in terms of features and getting worse in terms of capability to even work. One wonders how long this can go on. I'm generally a very loyal customer, by the way, but there are limits.<br /><br />A final note, if I might. I read every one of the then-562 ratings of QP 2014 before trying the download, along with every comment on every rating. I noticed several four- and five-star ratings which had no justification for them other than some vague murmurings to the effect that &#34;Quicken is great.&#34; In many of those instances, that was the only rating the person had ever given on Amazon, or one of two ratings. That, and a recent news program reporting that people were being paid to put in phony ratings for products to increase the averages (Intuit wasn't mentioned in the program), made me wonder whether all the high ratings of QP 2014 (relatively few that there are) were completely honest. I think it's clear that the great bulk of customers who have rated QP 2014 are nowhere near happy.<br /><br />Others have raised the issue. If they're right, as I suspect they may be, the &#34;real&#34; average rating for QP 2014 may well be closer to two stars at this point--maybe less. Of course, some people may well have had a fabulous experience with the program, and truly believe it merits four or five stars. My own experience was the opposite, and I hope that the information I've provided in this review has justified my one-star rating and will be of some assistance to other customers.<br /><br />P.S. Oh--and &#34;Kathryn,&#34; if you even exist, don't bother putting one of your canned comments on my review. Notwithstanding your blatant use of your (or a made-up?) first name, as though you're bosom-buddies with customers, I don't think most of us are fooled<br />for a moment into believing that you're dealing with us out of friendship. Yikes!
783	1	I'm a convert from Turbo-Tax.  They played games with the forms they included so I went to H&R Block.  I was very impressed with how well it read in data from last years Turbo-Tax return.  It seemed straight forward and the learning curve was small.
784	-1	Was forced to upgrade when my Dell computer crashed and had to be restored.  There was some issue with Quickbooks 2009 and Quickbooks refused to even talk to me unless I paid for the upgrade.<br />Bought it, the tech person spent about 5 minutes tweaking how to point to the restored files, and that was that.<br />The 2012 version doesn't have any new bells and whistles that make my life and job any easier.  If anything, it takes longer to load/start-up than before.<br />I've tried to get the online portion to work and sync with my bank accounts but there is a constant error that it can't connect to my bank.<br />Quickbooks 2012 is not worth the money if your older versions still work.<br />One great feature about buying it through Amazon, when your system crashes and you need to restore, it's easy to find and reinstall all of your programs that you purchased through Amazon, rather than sorting through boxes and drawers trying to find the discs.
785	1	Always fast and easy. Great!
786	-1	Would not download .contacted Microsoft Jumped through all the hoops I was told to jump through. They are not helpful at all. Contacted Amazon to get my money back again no help. I guess I got ripped off. Get the CD the download has big problems. I hope Microsoft people read this there support system needs work big time.
787	0	Somewhat slow, but loaded with features!
788	1	its good
789	0	Useful in a pinch.
790	1	Bought this for the price and quite happy with it. You do have to log into your Norton account if you have one which is good. Shows its authentic.
791	0	Quicken is very easy to use however it will not update to my bank account. It shows an error with the Quicken server. In order to download my transactions I need to manually download them from my bank account, save them to my computer & then upload to Quicken.
792	1	AS good as or maybe better than Microsoft office for any need I have found in the last 4 years. Microsoft is so full of themselves they want a fortune for the product or a 7 dollar monthly fee. Granted it is the Cadilac of software but for my spreadsheets and lists Apache works great and given the price it cannot be beat.
793	1	This antivirus software came personally recommended by &#34;Dr Dave&#34; Mason of computer talk radio fame.  It has been VERY reliable so is definitely a keeper! .
794	0	not as good as the old one
795	1	tought to learn at first but once you know how it works its great software had a few issues but it was just the learning curve
796	1	Perfect gift for the beginner/intermediate/advance photo geek.  This is an amazing tool and the work that comes from my son on it blows my mind!
797	-1	Crashes frequently
798	-1	Don't buy this on Amazon!!!  Downloading anything from them is a nightmare and you will end up wishing you had never tried.  Then the battle begins to try to get a refund.  What a total waste of time and energy!
799	-1	Was unable to download and was returned.  Very disappointed.
800	1	love the new interfaces and the details for investments
801	-1	Looks like a an old  way of doing things.  Don't understand half of it
802	0	After all the controversy I was disgusted with Turbo Tax. It's just okay. What I dislike is that after you input something, the screen goes back to the top instead of where you were working. I've lost faith in Turbo Tax, and will check out other programs for next year.
803	1	I am finding that I do not notice this software at all ... which is how it should be with AV software.... just do the job and stay out of the way. I do not, however, use the firewall feature. I don't need it since I am on my home, wired network. More importantly, I have never found any value to third party software as a firewall. Get a hardware firewall and the odds are that 99.99% of users have a home firewall router anyway. I also carry a portably firewall on the road and I do not use my computer on public WiFi networks. It is silly to send your personal data unencrypted across an open network and think a firewall will help you in any way.<br /><br />In any case, I have this software running on all 6 Macs in my home. 2 are older and are running Snow Leopard and the rest run Lion.  We have every mac there is (except Air): iMac, MacBook, Mini, MacBook Pro, and a Mac Pro. It runs fine on all of them. Some came with Lion and others were upgraded, I see no difference at all in performance. I did follow directions, however, and uninstall Virus Barrier, upgrade to Lion, then reinstall it. Perhaps the users that are complaining did not follow this procedure?<br /><br />In any case, all six of the Macs with Lion have experienced zero problems. I have relied on Intego for years with no issues and will continue to do so.
804	-1	Don't know yet. I downloaded it and now quicken won't open. Still using 2013 on my laptop afraid to download to it.
805	1	I downloaded from Amazon and my e-file code was not included with my confirmation e-mail as it should have been.  But a call to H&R Block got me my code.  The program had a lot of help messages and went very smoothly.  I liked it but found the roll bar was very anoying and easily overlooked.
806	1	The anti-virus just works.  Does not bog down the PC CPU.  The ability to connect and help others using the assist function is fantastic.
807	-1	It's very glitchy and the graphics options aren't that great. Trying to input text onto your project takes forever.  Not real happy with this purchase.
808	0	The title leads you to believe that state is included. However, it only gives you a number. If you want to print your state forms or e-file them, they require you to pay extra. I thought I was already paying for that when I decided to get the deluxe + state. Very deceptive naming on the part of Turbo Tax. The product is okay, but over-priced since it really DOES NOT include state.
809	-1	As things do happen sometimes, the software product code did not match the software. Unfortunately I had to call Amazon to correct the problem. Amazon quickly resolved the problem (Amazon is awesome!).
810	0	This product is good against viruses bit can be cumbersome in the background. It takes too much control over your computer.
811	1	Didn't face any issues while installing the program. Had another version of AVG before installing this and the upgrade was smooth.
812	0	My 4 year old son wasn't very impressed. He played with it for about 30 minutes and had enough. Very elementary. Too much so for my son, although he is very computer savvy so that might have been a reason.
813	1	Really easy to use.  All you need is your tax info and it's a slam dunk!!!!  You don't need to know anything about taxes,
814	1	Sketchbook Pro 7 is a great program, but could use better tools for supporting 3D sketches.  It is these shortcomings that keep sketchbook Pro 7 from being my main tool for sketching - I find I still need CAD (ViaCAD) and Illustration (Inkscape) tools to create the geometry for many technical sketches, which are then finished off in Sketchbook and/or Krita.  This program is awesome with the pen on my Surface Pro 3.<br /><br />The perspective tool is great for the rectilinear stuff, but it would be really nice to be able to have a &#34;3D-smart&#34; ellipse tool as well (or at least one that allows you to &#34;save&#34; a few standard ellipse settings, so you could have multiple ellipse sizes to reuse like with a real ellipse template.  As it is, if you need to duplicate an ellipse, you have to spend a lot of fiddly time moving, rotating, and resizing the ellipse tool to only sort-of replicate an ellipse you drew before.<br /><br />Likewise, another huge addition would be the ability to create persistent construction/guide lines (preferably visible (but never printable) and active by layer) - like the ellipse tool, construction/guide lines are only defined until you reset the guide.
815	0	I purchased this for my new business, and at first it was like looking at astrophysics. but after some help from my accountant and a little practice, I was able to perform basic activity related to my business transactions. I know it will pay off when tax season come around as it will be a couple of clicks away from doing my taxes since it keeps track of all my business financials and more. The only thing I had a problem with was the ridiculously expensive price for an old version.  The new version was cheaper at Office Depot. I had to buy this one because my accountant used it and recommended I use the same version so we can stay compatible.
816	0	It transferred my data from Quicken 2007 easily with just a few mistakes. It will not let you go to a specific date to review the worth at that time, nor can you set up mortgages, etc which are dependent on an interest rate. Hopefully they will fix more & more things & continue to improve it. I wish they could get it to work like the old (was it 2000?) Quicken on the PC side that you could project situations, how long your money would last, etc.
817	1	So far its similar to the previous version, but there are more views for reports overview as of now.
818	-1	I have seen all the positive reviews on cleaning up the PC for faster running time. -> which is great but would about files secured.<br /><br />I have not seen anyone give a review on securing files using guarding folders.
819	1	I've been using IObit software for years, and only paid because I wanted to. Since there are more than a few negative reviews for this product, I'd like to clear a few things up.<br /><br />Most importantly, IObit NEVER requires payment for their products to work. The free versions are free, and work just fine without a subscription. Yes, you will be prompted to buy a subscription when executing the software, but only need to 'x out' of the offer to run the scanner(s).<br /><br />Secondly, I have never had IObit Malware Fighter behave like malware. I do think that when I updated ASC recently it did install an online backup software, but all I had to do was uninstall it. Easy as that. Let me be clear, this was legitimate backup software, and was not malicious.<br /><br />Now, is this product a one step solution? No, it isn't, and neither are their other products, but they do a great job nonetheless. I use many IObit (free) products, but I also use Avira anti virus, and Malwarebytes anti malware. This system keeps my PC as clean and safe as possible for no cost.<br /><br />There is one caveat, however concerning IObit. Since different companies use different detection methods, they tend to detect each other as threats. For example, Malwarebytes WILL detect IObit products as threats. That does not mean they ARE threats, just that the detection methods conflict. In that case, all one has to do is add trusted software to an exclusions list.<br /><br />I have no idea why the negative reviewers had such problems. My guess is that they already had a lot of infestations, and using Malware Fighter made the infestations rebel against being removed.<br /><br />Bottom line is this; this, and other IObit products are free, AND trustworthy. Not only that, but the paid versions are reasonably priced compared to the dinosaurs that are Norton and McAfee - who many believe, by the way, are only in business because they release viruses and malware to keep unwitting customers like the one star reviewers gleefully paying outrageous yearly fees to keep their companies in business.ne star reviewers gleefully paying outrageous yearly fees to keep their companies in business.
820	1	Slightly more difficult to use than Turbotax but the price makes up for it.  You just have to do a little more reading on IRS rules when it comes to non-typical situations.
821	-1	TurboTax cannot handle complicated Academic Fellowship income (unreported and not on a w-2, and that is not for a qualifying educational expense). They refer you to the intracacies of IRS Pub 970 because their programming cannot ask you the pertenant questions to figure out your specific scenario. Be ware. If you go the TT route, check the final return to make sure that the program hasn't assumed that you have SE (self-employment) income. Also, I tried to use telephone support and their technician had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. Worse is that they gave me the run around, wouldn't listen, and wouldn't put me in touch with more experienced, supervisory staff. I was merely trying to assist them with a weakness in their software to create a better product. If you don't have complicated employment income, Turbo Tax is an excellent product.
822	1	I have used this for years.  It seemed a bit easier this year.  There was one minor glitch where it introduced something I had not entered and I had to work around it. I will likely stay with this product.
823	1	This is the second year I have purchased TurboTax Business and it works well.  I am a novice preparing business taxes and TurboTax Business, like its personal income tax counterparts, leads the uninitiated through the tax return preparation process with an easy to follow interviews.
824	1	I am learning all the positive options of Word.
825	0	I am not a computer geek so each time I renew my Quicken software I have had to go to them to install it. They readily respond and do a good job but it is still a bit of a hassle. I don't like the idea that Quicken wants you to buy the newest version of their software every year and that the version you buy will only work as purchased for three years. After three years you MUST purchase the newest version or aspects of your old version will stop working. Shame on you, Quicken!
826	1	The item was as described and was quick and efficient. It took a little while for me to figure out entering the key code for activation. But it worked as ordered. Thanks.
827	0	had problems downloading it had to try a few times and My husband like the program he uses it as a truck driver for miles but I have problems with it to complicated for me.
828	1	A free antivirus software that is easy to operate and install. I have been using for approx. six month's without any issues.
829	0	The software is OK but H&R's tech support is not satisfactory any more.  I had to call with a technical problem this year and they responded after April 15th!!  Also, their tech support is all mixed up as they don't know the difference between software that is licensed and installed on my computers and their hosted SaaS offering.  The tech support agents are not well trained and their call center technology is either no good or not set up well.  I have been a CPA for over 40 years and in the past when I have found technical tax issues, they were responsive.  When I have found software problems, they have been responsive.  This year, they have too few agents, don't answer the phone within hours, and the agents are not trained and supported.  Disappointing.
830	0	the back up part is not working but everything else works fine it.but this could be my computer and not the software itself
831	0	Not User friendly. Could not use to increase dpi of my images. Looks like it has a learning curve. Did not find any tutorial to get better resolution and dpi from current images.<br />Prem
832	0	well the social security end of it was not well explained especially the back pay part of it, If u get awarded your back pay then it does not explain your options U just get taxed on 85 % of your award, (If your spouse makes more than 44,000) no options or explanations. I had to research to find out my options and the turbo tax help was a joke. They did not even know what i was talking about
833	-1	I have been a quicken user for many years. Talk about disappointing! I upgraded to continue being able to do auto updates from my fin institutions. This function does not work... online balances are incorrect. Spurious transactions appear that are also mis categorized. This release is a disaster. If you are not a current quicken user, don't even think about buying this POC product. [Update] Intuit is trying to rectify the problems and have just released the R8 patch. It's just a matter of time before the product is solid.
834	1	TurboTax is easy, step-by-step, comprehensive and reasonably priced product. Includes e-filing for federal return. Just need to buy e-filing for the state. I have been using it for three years. The software checks for errors and offers satisfaction that your return is correct.
835	1	Helped to secure 3 PC's
836	-1	They need to be more clear with the changes they made. Nothing like spending an hour on taxes to find out you have to spend $60 more to get the refund they show.
837	1	The product speaks for itself. But I'd like to stress the ease of receiving the product, instant, and setup was within seconds. Not one problem, and my taxes were completed and files within 30 minutes. Thank you intuit, and thank you Amazon.
838	-1	I pay $30.00 for this software it won't record video game from my computer I tried different setting can't  get it to work..........recorded the window screen wile mouse is in course, on game action it doesn't
839	1	Very easy to use! Perfect for small or large size companies. I run a landscaping company and found it very easy to setup all the invoices and payments.<br />Pros<br />-Easy to get all the basics going. (Had mine setup within a hour or two)<br />-Flat rate pricing. (No yearly fees)<br />-Very professional invoices (Can be setup different for each customer)<br />-Auto saving feature<br />Cons<br />-Lot of different add-on that will take time to learn. (Not really a bad thing...)<br /><br />Get 5 stars in my eyes any day! Great for all users!
840	1	Great price for the product
841	1	its much easier and less complicated than the one I previously had.. plus a lot less time for converting.. I just love it .
842	1	"I did get the \\""ICE cyber security\\"" virus last year but I guess you can't expect free security to catch such a well crafted intrusion. Besides that I have been happier with Avast than I was with AVG."
843	-1	My 2009 version was kind of buggy but I tolerated it, though bugs went unfixed for years.  Just paid for 2012 version, and as soon as I install it and do a one step update, it hangs... every time.  This bug has been known and much discussed for a month now. Inexcusable - I know, because I write software for a living.  Why trust your finances to buggy software? Once you start using it you won;t want the pain of switching, so do yourself a favor and don't even try this crappy software.  - a dissatisfied customer
844	-1	bought it but never found the download link
845	0	Can't really complain if I get something for free.  It is user friendly for some stuff and not for others.  All in all a good product for the price FREE!
846	0	Having been a long-time user of Quicken (floppy disk days - 1990's), I viewed each new release as a better version of the previous release.  As DOS and Windows upgraded, so did Quicken along with more enticements that made the newer product version much better.  However, I HAD  to upgrade to 2015 over the 2012 version only b/c Intuit was no longer allowing 2012 users internet support/upgrades after just 3 years of use.  After purchasing online and upgrading, the latest version is slower to load and presents the same home screen information as the 2012 version with a few minor changes, none of which I really needed (don't need to know my credit scores by releasing private information to Intuit in order to get something my card company already provides me). All the other key features were already present in the 2012 home screen.  I know software companies have to provide some new enticing product every few years to stay competitive, but I was extremely satisfied with 2012 Quicken deluxe.  Maybe 2018 deluxe will be more incredulous over 2015.
847	1	I have been a loyal Turbo Tax user since 1997.  The changes to Turbo Tax products and the price charged this year prompted me to give H&R Block a try.  I have already received my Federal refund!  I was able to efile 4 Federal returns (Dad, Sister, and Daughter, plus mine) and used two different state products.  The software imported all 4 of our previous Turbo Tax return data without any issues.  The navigation process is simple and seamless.  There was additional cost for the second state program and the efiles beyond the one included.  Total cost for the 4 Federal efiles, 4 State efiles (2 different states) was about what I would have paid for TurboTax software alone this year.
848	-1	Really, guys? Why aren't these links working? You should certainly be able to load the program after you buy, so I am very disappointed with both Amazon and with Microsoft.<br /><br />Weeks later, still trying to install Office 365 from my Amazon account without any success, annoyed at the weak and unresponsive Amazon support staff that has not responded to my requests for assistance. They may have all day to be useless behind a computer, but I do not.
849	1	Nothing better.  Awesome.
850	-1	I will never buyTurbo Tax again. I purchased Turbo Tax 2013 last year but could not complete my 1040 Federal Return because it kept telling the appropriate forms were not available. I got tired of waiting so I went to H&R Block to get my 2013 Taxes completed.($59.00 down the drain)<br />  I purchased Turbo Tax 2014 this year. Federal 1040was completed OK, however  I found out that Tubo Tax had shut down the ability for me to complete my NY State return because the many fraudulent state returns filed using Turbo Tax.<br />  I believe in the future I will make My life easier by going to H&R block in the first place. Thank you for the chance to comment on My experience.
851	-1	I purchased this thinking it would have math practice for fractions, instead it's just a manager site for purchasing programs for math problems. A rip off in my opinion don't buy
852	0	Good and free way to open up and create on similar basis of Microsoft office products. Though there are certain drawbacks to the OpenOffice software, hence the words &#34;free application&#34;. When a project is done say in  the &#34;WORD&#34; application or supposed similar &#34;OpenOfficeTextDoc.&#34; when opening one from the other or to the other...? Alignment is off, spacing screws up, etc.
853	-1	Free doesn't do much, after download offered a (much better) version of Avast. Now I have websites that do not open, the software deletes and blocks sites that I use with no option to save them. I would not recommend this software.
854	1	I am still getting used to the new changes but so far have had no major issues.
855	-1	Converted over from PC version.  That went well.  However, the MAC version is pathetically slow. It takes up to 20 seconds to save a single transaction.  This is on a fast SSD Quad core machine.  Never had that trouble in the PC version.  Staff complaining.
856	-1	Does not work on my computer with windows 7.
857	-1	To my knowledge quicken does not warn you that if you buy this product after having owned any other quicken product that has more features, that it will mess up your data...intentionally.  I bought it, I installed it, then up came a popup that said it would not work and would mess up my data; that I now had to buy a more expensive version.  Solution:  Say this clearly prior to purchase, not after.  Disgusting marketing people at Quicken.
858	1	I've used other Tax Prep products over the years, but nothing comes close to the ease of use and completness of TurboTax.
859	0	Didn't work after installation. Each program would quit right away, Error message, &#34;Microsoft xxx 2013 Has Stopped Working&#34;. After wasting a lot of time I had to uninstall ABBYY Finereader. Hope this helps someone.
860	0	I bought some software and it could only be opened in Corel Drawing. I read an internet post that said that this software would open Corel files...no, it does not so I purchased software I will probably not use.
861	1	I have been using this product since version 2 for DOS.  I really can't live without it.  IT keeps getting better.  This year's version is more stable and less buggy than 2014.  It isn't perfect but it is perfectly usable.
862	-1	It's good, but I saw it for less at costco, 20$ less to be exact. I wish they would refund me that money. But it's really a good program. I'm in medical school so I use onenote all day, and I have to say this seems to run smoother and more compatible. People complain about little things that really don't matter. But mine installed just fine and has given me no problems since. I'm just glad I didn't have to do the year long subscription only to pay more later.<br /><br />Update - 03/27/14<br />Well I'm stuck with a program I hate. All my medical notes are stuck on this and I can't get off it. I want to use other programs that don't change a freaking annual cost, like anything with google or any of the many free apps like evernote. Don't get me wrong we're all stuck with the monopoly of Microsoft and their products work, but they cost money where as google's products are free, like google docs, google sheets, etc. And if you're a google hater there is other stuff out there. If you have to get this then I'm sorry. But try using the many free options out there. I can't wait for more companies like google to come out with free products so we can all leave microsoft one day.
863	1	Avast Free Antivirus works great.  I have used it for over 4 years and have had no problems with it.  It alerts you to potential spam emails and other phishing emails and lets you decide what you want to do.  I highly recommend it.
864	-1	This  is one of the worst software packages I have had to use.  Everyone in our office hates it.  Multi-user functionality is basically a joke.  It is painfully slow and crashes all the time, even on new hardware (core i7's with SSD drives).  After paying Intuit for monthly support and shrinking our company file size, they could not fix the problems.  Be aware that using QuickBooks over a VPN is not recommended by Intuit.  You have to use remote desktop and devote another local PC to Quickbooks because it is so poorly written that it cannot handle temporary connectivity interruptions.  Honestly, who sells software in 2014 that doesn't work over a VPN???  It's not like VPNs are new or unusual.  Quickbooks even runs slow in our LAN over WiFi (apparently Gigabit Ethernet is recommended).  Intuit's suggestions are to throw away the money we spent on this and:  (1) move to Enterprise, which costs thousands of dollars - no surprise there, (2)  to move to an expensive hosted solution ($35+/mo per user), or move to QuickBooks online, which doesn't have all the features we need from desktop QuickBooks. We're now testing FrontAccounting, which is free and amazingly fast.  It's built on a real database, MySQL (unlike QuickBooks Pro), it lets you have many simultaneous users, and it hasn't crashed once in our testing.
865	0	NIS has always been a memory hog and slows the computer.  It's better now but I've been using Microsoft Security Essentials and have yet to have a problem.
866	1	It's a tax program and it makes doing taxes easier, There is nothing wrong with the program itself. It's usable, reasonably priced software that's downloadable and I will use it next year as I have for many years past.
867	-1	THE WORST.  They trick you into buying their software then constantly prompt you to upgrade or else you can't file.  I even know what I need to put in but they won't give me the forms.  I used to love Turbotax but I will NEVER use them again.  I am trying eztaxreturn that lets you file free ones if you're under a certain AGI (see the IRS, they have a list of free services.)  This is so disappointing.  And try getting through to their customer service.  It's worse than the IRS!  Have to wait 45 minutes and then they wouldn't refund me.  Never ever again.  As an ex-loyal customer they stink.
868	-1	I could not use this purchase it was an invalid registration number. I would appreciate a refund on this product as I am unable to use after following all the links required. thank you.
869	0	I assumed that since it was +State that you would be able to file state electronically for free-not the case. I will take blame for that though. Overall Turbo Tax seemed a lot easier to use and had more explanations. There were a few things that you can click on for an explanation that bring up literally no information so that was confusing. I have a residential energy credit and although the HR Block website said that I can submit electronically even though it won't be processed for a few weeks, the system would not let me submit it. All that being said, I paid $24, so you get what you pay for!
870	0	I bought this so I could put all my banking information in one place. I went along putting in my accounts all excited until I got to my main bank. I keep getting a message to try again in a few hours. However it's been weeks. I also can't add about half of my credit cards. Over all its missing the ability to do as advertised. But for the accounts that load its wonderful.
871	-1	They really screwed it up by deleting Schedules C and E from Deluxe. Then with egg on their face they offered a very tangled &#34;pay now for an upgrade&#34; for $30 and said they'll refund the fee (or $25?) when I file, or something like that. I had to upgrade once to Premier (the $30 deal, maybe $25 back if I can figure out how to get it) and then again to the &#34;Home and Business&#34; version. The change just doesn't seem straightforward and walking it back has come out clumsy and amateurish.<br /><br />As it is, with the upgrades, the step-by-step interface is a little more infuriatingly repetitive every year. Still, it does what it's supposed to do.
872	0	I don't know. Interface is dated and confusing, I'm wondering why Quickbooks is always the go to product.
873	1	I've been using H&R Block for over a decade now - well before H&R Block rebranded TaxCut - and I've been very pleased with the product every year.  The five included e-files and free state program means that my entire family can process and e-file their returns without any extra cost, and it's even cheaper, too!  My taxes are fairly simple; nothing more complicated than a mortgage interest deduction most years, but even when I've sold stocks or had other somewhat complicated returns I've had no issues getting everything to work correctly.    TurboTax seems to be the preferred program for filing taxes these days, especially since Amazon promotes it at the expense of everything else. However, the reduction of functionality of the standard TurboTax releases this year has no doubt led to increased interest in the competition.  Worry not - H&R Block will give you everything you need, and will import your TurboTax data as well!
874	1	I had a problem getting an APPCRASH error when trying to open QuickBooks 2012 Pro.  I wouldn't even make it to the splash screen before it crashes.<br /><br />I spent quite a few hours working around the issue, and made one final attempt to reach out to Intuit before giving up and going to another software package.<br /><br />Luckily, we were able to pinpoint the issue to me saving my backup to a network drive and using a UNC path(i.e. \\networkdrive\folder).<br /><br />This was never a problem in 2009, but apparently there is a bug in 2012.<br /><br />Because Intuit support helped me and did not give up on me, I am changing my review to 4 stars.  That goes a long way with me.<br /><br />Hopefully they can fix that bug so I can back up to my network drive, but for the time being, I can move the backups manually.
875	0	Been a Quicken users for years and a Mint user.  The new app combined the best of both worlds which is great. I think they still have some work to do with the budgeting. We follow the Zero Based budgeting method, where every dollar is spent on paper on purpose for the paycheck comes in. And the budget is monthly and then allocated paycheck to paycheck.  The quicken system does not seem to be handle this zero based budgeting method, so still having to use spreadsheets for my monthly budgets.
876	-1	never git it never worked ???
877	-1	Can not download on as many computers as it says (or won't download properly) Nothing but problems with the email
878	1	Excellent program.  Very helpful , as I need to print my own recipes , and also include nutritional information.
879	0	I purchased and downloaded this straight from Amazon.  I own Elements 9 and Lightroom 4.  I wanted to update my Elements for the new features and ability to run ACR 7.4.  After a successful download, I can get the editor portion to open and work just fine.  I love the new layout and added features.  Problem is...I can't open the organizer portion.  I have tried to open it from the program, and from the editor.  No go.  It keeps telling me the program has closed unexpectedly.  I tried to deal with Adobe customer service, but they don't have phone support for Elements - only online chat.  That may be the worst customer service experience of my life.  I guess if you don't buy the $1,000 program/suite, they don't have time for you.  After more than 1/2 hour, setting up new users, and bunch of other wasted time, no one can get the organizer to work, and Amazon won't give me my money back.  5 stars for the editor, -2 stars for inability to get 1/2 the program to work and poor service from Amazon/Adobe.
880	-1	By removing Sch D you hurt lower income Seniors who are on modest retirements and now have to pay a lot more just for ONE form.<br /><br />I think I will point this out to AARP and other Senior groups.  TuboTax is getting greedy.
881	1	I love Avast, it automatically updates and tells you that you are current.  You can see the icon and know it is protecting you.
882	0	"I evaluated 2012 Premier vs. 2012 Deluxe.  Advertising says that the Premier handles investments better than Deluxe.  Don't believe it.  I saw no difference at all between 2012 Premier and 2012 Deluxe with regards to investments (or anything else).  The \\""differences\\"" that there are is a link to Quicken.com's investment module online, which, if you're a serious investor, provides you no information different than that which you would receive from your own broker.  Seriously, this is NOT worth $20 extra.  As for the software itself, I've been a Quicken user since the beginning and still think it's one of the best programs out there, but I think Intuit is just getting really cocky about issuing useless upgrades with little new functionality.  I think that any minor upgrades should be free, or at least discounted more than $10 (when you can buy them at Amazon for less than the discounted price anyway.)  I'm sick of deceptive advertising and pulling support after only 2 years.  Intuit has a monopoly and acts like it.  I long for the days when Parson's Technology was still in business."
883	0	Cushions too small but good looking.<br />Will use them and see how they wear.<br />Wanted 25 larger x and y dimensions.
884	-1	It was an expensive unnecessary buy. The program works and all but I regret this buy because there is no feature that the computer doesn't already have it.
885	-1	I wish I had not purchased Q 2013.  The new features are not worth the hassle. The single most frustrating problem is that when I get everything corrected and updated, backed up and ready to close the program, after clicking on close, a reminder pops up and suggests that I back up to the cloud.  Each time I do that(will never do it again)when the cloud update is finished I see that changes to my account display have been made.  I edit the accounts back to the appropriate display and they stay that way until I update the cloud and all gets reversed. VERY FRUSTRATING!
886	1	great product
887	-1	Junk.I installed it ,it updated and now will only open in Admin mode. When it does it tells you it does not support running in admin mode But it is at least functional. Got on with a support tech from India who English is a second language and he told me to uninstall and try again. I did, same results. It is Ver R5. This is a know issues from what I read on the web. If you try to start it in regular mode it tells you to allow permissions on 2 files or it won't start. I did it and it is still DOA. Search Quicken 2014 qw.log problem and you will find others with the same problem. I have been using Quicken since day 1 and never had issues like this and I am very Win savy. Don't buy till VerR6 update come out comes out.
888	-1	Installer crashes at 75 percent, avoid.
889	0	I have been using Quicken for 15+ years and I've learned that every upgrade comes with its own adjustments and growing pains.<br /><br />Specifically, the 2013 version has completely changed the process for making a loan payment. It used to be clear on the loan summary page where to go to make payments, how to adjust the payment to account for extra principal and see a summary of the loan history. Now those items are separated and not at all easy to find.<br /><br />A more minor issue, but no less annoying, was the sound set-up on the new version of Quicken in Windows 8. I repeatedly went into the Quicken settings to verify that sounds were turned on but no sounds resulted during functions that used to produce them. I thought maybe I had an issue with my speakers, sound card or volume control. Finally, my tech support guru discovered that the sounds had to be linked to the Quicken program. What's the point of having them installed with the program if they can only be activated by a super secret password in a completely camouflaged location?<br /><br />I'm also somewhat disappointed in the customization properties of the various graph pages. Although I appreciate the ability to have multiple versions of my Net Worth graph, charting several years' history and a shorter timeframe simultaneously, I would rather be able to shrink the size of the graph down so that I can fit other features in a viewable space. Instead, the net worth graph is locked at full screen width which looks absurd with almost any range settings.
890	1	This was an update to my already active FastAccess software and it's even faster than before.  I love this software because it lets me keep my laptop secure without having to remember my password.
891	-1	I upgraded from Elements 10 so I could import my D7100's RAW files; Elements 10 requires a conversion to DNG and is not going to be upgraded to handle the D7100 RAW files. What I found was a dumbed down, clunky interface. The functionality is there, but good like finding it.
892	0	I talked to someone about it, and was basically told, &#34;too bad&#34;  so a good product, but next time, I will buy it at Costco!
893	1	very fine and usable product and it is very dependable and easy to install and use.  First-rate.  everyone should use it.
894	1	Best product in the space.  The only drawback is lack of telephone support--you pay to talk with someone.  I'll use it next year.
895	1	Very Good at a good price
896	-1	I mistakenly thought this product was aimed at preventing virus infections from Symantec, like Security Scan.  WRONG, this is a whole software suite of virus-like antivirus and IS NOT AIMED at preventing tagalong virus installs like Security Scan.<br />Terrible.  Just terrible.
897	1	What can you say it is Norton.  I like it better than MAF  It is nice just to be able to download it
898	1	Fast shipping, works as expected.
899	-1	I moved from CA to OR during 2013 and TurboTax errored in the tax for OR.<br />They were no help AT ALL in resolving the error.
900	1	Used this tax software for years with our home business. Always works well including importing our banking information. . .
901	1	I only use Avast for my security. I've never had any problems with Avast. Avast keeps me up to date on my network all of the time.
902	1	It arrived on time through downlaod.  Everything was perfect and the software worked perfectly.  From the first ordering to the final receipt, all was done on time..
903	0	Just be aware that both federal and state preparation software is included, but only federal e-filing is included. State e-filing is currently an additional $19.99....
904	1	so much easier to use than I ever thought possible.  Anyone can use it right from the start. But just in case, comes with a handy manual!~
905	-1	I specifically bought this for the additional free state but Turbo tax charged me an additional 40.00 for the state.  What a ripoff..amazon at 45.00 and then 40.00 more for the state...so in essense I paid 85.00 for a piece of software that is suppose to be 45.00.
906	1	I've used Turbo Tax Home & Business for a few years now and every year I've been completely satisfied. The best part of Turbo Tax is the wizard that walks you through every step with great detail.
907	-1	Not Word Perfect.  Do not buy this thinking you can update your Word Perfect program, despite the fact that the graphic includes the .doc designation for Word Perfect Files.  Sounds like this is a complete waste of time and money for most users.
908	-1	I have been using Quicken for years, and this upgrade ate more of my time than all the previous versions put together.  The bank connect stuff is particularly bad.  I have had to deactivate and reactivate, and delete accounts, several times.  The future entry stuff also had some whoppers, somehow automatically creating splits with scores of duplicate entries.  At one point, it told me I had spent over 16k in a single day.  I am used to being underwhelmed by the new functionality, but when I have to spend hours correcting stuff...yuck.<br /><br />At this point, the greatest skill I see in the design is hiding and disabling functionality from previous versions.  I can't give you an alternative, but don't say you weren't warned.
909	0	Unfortunately my computer didn't support it. I didn't get to try it.
910	0	I made the mistake of buying this product without realizing that it did not have state forms included.  It was my mistake, but the different versions of Turbo Tax can cause confusion: Download vs. CD; Deluxe vs. Premier; state vs. non-state.  Even though it was my mistake, I was aggravated by the excessive fee to download the state forms from within the product as compared with the few extra dollars I would have spent if I had bought the state version.  Luckily, Virginia has an online site to submit state taxes, which only took me an hour to complete.  In the end, TurboTax lost the $20 that I would have normally paid to e-file the state taxes.  Ultimately their pricing folly allowed me to find their biggest competitor: the free state website.
911	1	The process of getting the software as a download worked well. An easy step-by-step coaching process, the download and execution easy.
912	1	Solid product; basically it was what I needed and expected form Microsoft.  If you need a desktop database product this one will suffice.
913	1	Easy to use. Prompts you with all the right questions to max your deductions
914	0	didn't find the virus.  went with vipre
915	1	I had problems with this & had to contact Norton  regarding it.  It actually was not working when I thought I was protected with it. It took Norton about an hour+ to bring it up to date.  Now that everything is working like it should, I do like it, but I don't know if I will purchase it next year through Amazon. I don't think this Older Version was a good idea. Norton is an excellent company to deal with & glad they got it straightened out. I might purchase it directly through Norton even though the price is higher next time.
916	-1	I have been using TurboTax for many years but, as many other users, I was disappointed with Intuit's new unfair pricing schedule, so I decided to give H&R Block software a try.  My low 2-star review was due mainly to one reason: bugs.<br /><br />First, there was the infamous crash with importing last year's TurboTax returns on XP.  After they finally fixed the issue I was able to almost complete my tax return.  In the end, there was another bug with the form required to file the Affordable Health Care Act.  It was simply giving me an error with little explanation.  I completed the form three times exactly as I received it from the government, and I was still getting this error, which prevents me from filing my return.<br /><br />I contacted H&R regarding this using their &#34;chat window&#34; (I had to wait over an hour to get a representative).  After explaining my problem she told me that there was a patch coming out on March 12 that would fix the problem.  That's March 12.  One month before taxes are due.<br /><br />I don't know if the software development division of H&R Block has a Quality Assurance department, or what they do all day.  Any decent QA department would finds the bugs in the software BEFORE it is released, especially obvious ones like the ones I've encountered so far.  Needless to say, I will no longer be using their products after this year.<br /><br />I did give them 2 stars instead of 1 because the interface was easy to follow (easier than filling out tax forms).  And it was cheap.  I guess I got what I paid for.
917	-1	I have had Quicken Deluxe for around 3 months. It is horrible. I won't go into all the problems I have had with it just today's.<br /><br />When you display your check register in newest to oldest transaction order, the balance column becomes worthless. Quicken still totals your balance is some kind of quasi top to bottom format that makes your balance totally worthless. Every bank in America can calculate the balance correctly when you reverse the date order but Quicken can't. You are left to only view your transactions in oldest to newest order then start at the beginning and scroll all the way down to the bottom to see your current transactions.<br /><br />When I contacted their tech support department I found only rude, uninterested people...not very intelligent either, I might add. One guy tried to convince me that if you SUBTRACT a negative 10 from a negative 20, you get a negative 30. Humm....(-20) - (-10) = -10. That's what I had been taught when I majored in mathematics in college anyway! I guess Quicken has changed the rules of mathematics!<br /><br />Finally they finally by telling me that that is the way the product was designed so it is correct. I tried to point out that if my balance is nowhere near correct, how can their product be correct? That was just my opinion, they said. I didn't know you could have an opinion about the correct answer in math. Then they suggested I use a calculator. Why didn't I think of that! Use a calculator instead of Quicken....or at least another vendor's product!
918	1	Got this badboy for 10$ u cant beat that for a year but now i have comcast so norton is free oh well =3 best 10$ i spent
919	1	Xero is a good product.  The templates and customization for professional appearance would be a huge benefit for most businesses. Contractors should beware there is no way to do job cost accounting.  Businesses selling commodity services and products would likely be very satisfied.
920	1	Great Product
921	0	Lacks many basic features.
922	-1	It took several times to get the second piece of this software package to download and I'm still not sure if I have it all.<br />I'd advise buying the CDs in the box and installing it that way.<br />Also, I got absolutely no response when I tried to contact customer support.<br />So buying this was very much not a satisfying experience.<br />Also, a refund/rebate advertised with this product does not appear to be part of the download purchase. The advertising did NOT make this clear.<br />Buyer beware!
923	-1	The program slow down the computer when viewing sites with advertisements.  It tries to blocks/check too many sites which makes browsing extremely difficult.
924	-1	The reviews are correct.  Don't waste your time with this software.  And to add insult to injury, Intuit support was terrible.
925	0	but we have used it for several years, and at this point continue to do so.  Wish the product DIDN't have so many bells and whistles.  As a 63 year old, I find it too complex.
926	-1	This review is strictly for the download/install process. It's terrible. Save yourself the hassle and order the boxed software instead. But if you have already bought the download and are experiencing the issues others are writing about - that it asks you for the language level discs and won't let you continue....the trick is - uninstall then re-install. But then, when you get to the point where it asks you to check updates- DO NOT CHECK FOR UPDATES. Select wait until later. Once you do that it will ask if you want to download and install the language levels. It's a three pack, so it repeats the language level download 3 times. Then it asks you for the product key (which is the same for all three). The key can be found in &#34;Your Software Library&#34;<br /><br />Now to find out what the program is actually like.....
927	-1	I've used turbo tax for years with nothing but 5 stars. This year however has been a joke!  I've been trying for more than 2 weeks to simply print my return.  I'm relatively sure I'm not the 1st to rant about the problem, but honestly,  get it fixed.  I need to print and snail mail my state return before the 15th of April! !
928	-1	FORMER TurboTax customer. Why would they get rid of the schedule C and other forms in Deluxe this year? BAD move intuit. I'm not paying more just because I have a small business. I've been using your product for years, and have always used the deluxe package to file. Now, you wait until I get everything entered and to the business part, and tell me I need to pay another $40? Yeah right.... I'm no longer a TurboTax customer, and I hope others will bail ship on them too for such a poor business decision.
929	0	"Great tax preparation software, I've been using it for years. However note that you will have to pay to e-file for both the federal and state filings. The total, federal, state e-filings, and the \\""Refund Deposit Account Fee\\"" totaled $62.85."
930	1	Makes taxes so easy!
931	-1	It is too expensive for what it provides.  I prefer to use LibreOffice or OpenOffice which have as good compatibility with the WIndows versions as this does.
932	0	What can I say?  Much better price than office supply stores and it does what it says it does.
933	1	Excellent software, for the price you can't do better!  Has almost all of the features you could ask for.  It won't draw for you, but it will make everything else easier. It will take some time to learn how to use it, but there are a lot of tutorials on youtube, some are excellent. I highly recommend it.
934	-1	BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!<br /><br />Amazon will change their price on you without notice. I attempted to purchase and download QuickBooks Mac 2013 the price changed in an instant from $163 that was displayed on the product page to $176 (before taxes) in checkout. When I alerted Customer Service to this issue, they passed me along to their Software and Download Department, who was supposed to contact me within 1-2 business days. They never called! When I called them back 3 days later, customer service told me that there was nothing they could do for me. And the price has continued to increase daily.<br /><br />With sneaky price changes like this, it will be a long time before I buy from Amazon again!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008S0IV9G B008S0IV9G]]
935	0	It treated my homepage website as though it were infected with a Trojan (which it wasn't) and it took three calls to the company to have them fix the problem.
936	-1	I found TurboTax to be intentionally misleading when it comes to &#34;State&#34;. They allow you to fill in your information but charge upwards of $20 to submit for you. Pretty shady. Not sure if I would buy them again.
937	0	The download process at Amazon works well.  I'm not thrilled about the latest version of this H&R Block at Home 2010 Deluxe.  The Deduction Pro is online.  Deduction Pro is painful for charitable contributions.  You also can't edit it once you've completed an entry if it has more than 50 items in it.  I had to go back and edit it because I had the wrong year on a contribution (the calender doesn't default to 2010).  It won't allow you to edit the date or any items if there are more that 50 items in it.  That's rediculous.  I had to delete the entry and create a new one.  Finding the donated items in their drop down lists is slow and painful.  Reentering over 50 items is a giant waste of my time.  Once completed, you then tell the H&R program where the downloaded 'deduction pro' file is.  I have yet to find the web link (again) in the program to get to the Deduction Pro website.
938	1	I have used H&R Block software for several years because it's cheaper than TurboTax and almost as good.  (Amazon had a great one-day sale, so that made it more appealing.)  My only complaint is the changes they make in the software screen info changes from time to time and can be tricky if you don't read everything carefully.  Otherwise, it's a decent package.
939	0	Not much to review.  I changed from McAfee just to try something different.  We'll see if it does as advertised.
940	-1	Rejected Avas new upgrade and in unloading it their software left my computer with a 169--- IP address which cut me off from the internet.
941	0	difficulty with state taxes .<br />I get no response from turbotax about it
942	-1	I frequently use my PC offline (disconnected from the interwebs).  I cannot configure / disable this product when I'm offline.  I don't have configuration control over context menus (e.g. Pop-up menus that now have Bitdefender on it), and I can't see what the product is doing to all the drivers on my system.
943	-1	Its been a couple of hours since my first look at Office 2013 but my chin is still on the floor.  Have they lost their minds??!! I thought Windows 8 was homely with its minimalist squares in neo-CGA colors, but Office 2013 may be the UGLIEST piece of software I have ever seen. Its an abomination. No longer a fan; count me an avowed hater.
944	1	It's quite convenient to have the opportunity to directly download the program, rather than have to wait for it in the mail. Price is better than purchasing in-store; also don't have to store a CD or product key - it's all electronic.
945	0	Good price for the package, but be warned that if you need to file more than 1 state it was expensive!
946	-1	Bogged the computer down more then the cookies and other malware did. Computer had daily lock ups with this installed. It was constantly trying to remove fills that I know for a fact were safe.  Bit the bullet and just reinstalled windows. I would sugest Mcafee or AVG long before this product.
947	0	Works as expected however the exile for the state return is overpriced. I opted to print out my state return and file it by mail instead of paying for electronic filing.
948	1	TurboTax by choice....
949	0	They are not very good.  Computer slowed down
950	0	The software is okay.  But the basic software only converts one minute of video to mp3.  To get full conversion, you have to pay another $29.00 for a supplemental software download (the basic software download also cost $29.00 - on November 13, 2013 that was the price).  Maybe the problem was I didn't read the fine print for the basic software.  But I think it should have been made more obvious that the basic software only converts one minute of video to mp3.  I might have thought twice about paying $58.00 instead of the $29.00 I thought it was going to cost me.  When I found out, I was already too far into a project not to pay another $29.00 to finish the project.  BUT TAKE NOTICE: TO GET FULL LENGTH VIDEO TO MP3 CONVERSION, IT WILL COST YOU MORE THAN WHAT YOU PAY FOR THE BASIC SOFTWARE.  That said, after the sticker shock of the supplemental software download, the software performed well.
951	-1	I have been a loyal TT customer for over 20 years and shocked again by their price gouging with this new bait and switch to Premier from either Basic or Deluxe Version in prior year. I think that Bob Meighan has lost his mind in thinking customers will blindly follow him off the cliff. This should be the beginning of the end for Turbo Tax products. I remember Bob from Price Waterhouse as a good guy and do not understand where he lost his way this year. I will not purchase Premier and hereby end my relationship with Turbo Tax & Intuit after an over 20 year customer relationship.<br /><br />Remember Palm Pilot and Blackberry? Turbo Tax will be next with this arrogant thinking that they have a monopoly in tax software and can do as they please.
952	-1	As a longtime Turbo Tax user i am completely baffled at the marketing changes. After reading the VP reply, I was appalled at his completely stupid reply. Since when is the customer 's job to choose the right product when the company changes labeling. Just raise the price of your well loved and purchased product instead of confusing everyone. It's the companies responsibility to please not alienate their customers. This VP would be a perfect fit for a job in our current government administration. I have always purchased the premier version but will not this year as I have spent 45 minutes reading reveiews and confusing company labeling. Will purchase from a competent and honest company instead.
953	0	It wasn't what I wanted but it was full of good information and I will tell my friends about it.
954	0	I found that I have a lot to learn about how this version works. I have used older versions with some degree of competence, but this one challenges me,
955	1	I'm an independent computer tech and a master at finding and removing malware.  I use Avast. Why? Although this is an Antivirus program, it also has two other features that I believe make Avast ahead of all other AV programs.<br /><br />The first is the Software Updater.  Most malware that infects computers (up to 98% of malware) could be prevented by just updating your software on your PC.  No one does this because they don't understand that Java, Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash, Apple Quicktime, and Internet Explorer need their respective updates to fill security holes that have been found by malware programmers.  Just updating these programs can prevent the vast majority of bad stuff happening to you on your PC.<br /><br />The second feature is the Browser Cleaner feature.  It will find those pesky browser hi-jackers, pop-up ad generators, and other junk you didn't know you installed and make your online experience so much better.<br /><br />There is a minor con to Avast and that's in its setup.  I have to set it to look for PUPs (Potentially Unwanted Programs) in 8, yes 8 different areas of the settings to make sure that every scan it can do will look for them.  This is SOOOOOO wrong to do, but Avast is not the only AV software that has this issue.  If you read this Avast, please make a checkbox in ONE spot in the settings to choose to choose to look for PUPs in EVERY scan.  I almost docked a star for this unorganized setup structure for different scans.  Also, to AV companies, I'd love to have PUPs searched for as a DEFAULT please.<br /><br />I feel I need to make a YouTube video for others to watch and be able to set up their AV correctly because most people don't have a clue that AV software even needs to be set up, but the default settings of most of them are very slack on what they catch.  Even though I could make this YouTube video, I believe Avast, AVG, Norton, McAfee, etc., should make their own videos to explain some of the ludicrous terms they expect averagepeople to understand, or just hire me to tell you what you what people really want and need and I'll make you millions more.  Yeah, I know. Fat chance, but it truly, truly is your loss by not doing it.<br /><br />I've used, installed, troubleshot, and removed practically every AV software out there and know what they can do.  This one has the best features - period.  The pay version makes these features automatic, the free version you have to manually run them but either version will do the job well.  If you stick with the free version, remember to &#34;register&#34; Avast so that it will stay free and also remember that if you try the trial version, you'll have to pay for it later or remove it and keep the free basic version.  This can be confusing how to do this, which is another reason I may have to make a video to show how to use this correctly.  Stay tuned!
956	1	Makes doing your taxes easy.  Just fill in the blanks.  Very simple to use and easy to amend if you make mistakes.
957	-1	NO MEDIA option.  Bad reviews and problems!!!  Purchase the 2010 if you can still get it.<br />Also no internet required to install 2010 & ONLY internet option to install 2013.
958	1	I had trouble because it downloaded partially so when I tried to redownload it, I would get a message that I needed to close the version I already had.  I did not have a way to close the version because the program had deleted it.  Quicken 2014 would delete itself the next day and a couple of times after that.  After doing a good bit of searching, I realized I needed to go to uninstall programs and delete the program, then start over with the new download.  The problem is corrected now and everything is great.  The problem was probably me and nowt the download.  I am very pleased now.  Thank you.
959	-1	It's actually worse than last years version, and the workaround to import from QBO no longer functions.
960	1	I've used Premiere Elements through several editions mainly to edit the commercials out of commercial TV programs that I intended to keep for my own use.  It is a relatively inexpensive software program that does a good job and is fairly easy to get started with and use.  There are an abundance of help and tutorial programs available both with the program and on line.  Each new edition seems to recompile the videos slightly faster and with slightly better quality<br /><br />My complaint with the package is with the way I edit commercials out.  Each new edition seems to require me to learn a new way of getting the job done.  Perhaps the changes make it easier to put together videos from your own stills and videos but learning a new way just to edit videos with each new edition seems like just changing for the sake of change.
961	1	"I read the other reviews and know that others don't enjoy Homer's voice as much as we do, but I have to say that my family laughs out loud everytime Homer speaks.  True, we only use this on rare occasions because we don't need online map directions for driving around town.  Typically we turn this program on about three times a year for long distance travel.  When Homer says \\""you found your destination, you are a genius\\"" we all laugh out loud!"
962	0	Interface looks great, however ran into issues syncing accounts with my bank account, which work fine in the Windows version.  This is likely specific to my regional bank as my credit card accounts sync'd easily.
963	0	The software itself is easy to use and intuitive. But constant problems with activation and getting rid of that stupid TRIAL VERSION UPGRADE NOW  screen watermarking recordings, even after I paid for TWO licenses and it took a week to get a response from the company. Five stars for the simplicity, zero stars for frustration in activating the license (issue eventually resolved), five stars for being very simple to use and unlike other screen capture software, recording audio is not a problem.<br /><br />Follow up: Upon purchasing this software from the Movavi site, I was eventually rewarded with a solution to the constant registration rejection problem. It involved removing a folder from the hard drive's registry, NOT something that the layman or novice would think of. After removing the offending information from the registry, the software worked. Amazon's price is good, and they are sympathetic to your issues. It's a hassle dealing with support based on another continent, however.
964	-1	Didn't even get to the software because I spent 30 min downloading it from Amazon to find I need a second disc.  Then Amazon tells me its my security settings however I download and install thins all the time.  What a bunch of crap!
965	0	Difficult to use if you have a K-1 and non-reimbursed expenses. Requires manual entries which negates electronic filing. TaxAct was much easier, worked better and resulted in the same outcome, except could still file electronically. Some of TaxActs' questions were easier to understand than Block's. Have used H&R Block since 2002 but will consider other options in the future.
966	1	Great program
967	1	After so many years of being a loyal Intuit customer, TurboTax Deluxe is &#34;OUT&#34; and H&R Block Deluxe is &#34;IN&#34;.  The five free e-files fit my needs just right.  The product works just like TurboTax, so do not fear this change.
968	0	Worked well importing prior years data. Had problem with a Ma worksheet that even the expert could figure out why it happened. 2 levels of help got me through it. Took a while, but the people were very helpful and professional.
969	-1	I DIDN'T LIKE THE SECURITY FOR THE MONEY. I WAS OFFENDED BY THEIR LACK OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR PC AS FAR AS PERFORMANCE GOES FOR YOUR PC LAPTOP. THANK YOU GREG MILO.
970	1	Great security software for all your devices and at a good price.  Easy to download and install.
971	1	We have used TurboTax for several years, and it is easy enough to use. The only inconvience is the time factor, but with patience it goes well. In the future we may use the e-z version, since the IRS has made the Schedule-A a moot point for retirees. We will continue to use TurboTax as long as it is available.
972	1	Very powerful but accessible tool.  I use this in combination with Lightroom and I have all the photo processing capabilities that I need for my personal and my professional photographs.
973	-1	I was hoping to upgrade from CS3, but no way I would go for this CC monthly scam!<br />Time to look for an alternative, who knows? with all the new apps coming out, I am sure Adobe is replaceable, especially since now no one likes them. Do not fall for this! Demand better treatment of loyal customers!<br />SHAME ON YOU ADOBE!
974	-1	Would not take any emails I have so made one up and was the only way could get product to download. Not impressed.
975	0	This was an absolute pain to deal with. I ordered this on Amazon because it was cheaper than from Microsoft itself. I then had to call Microsoft and had them take remote control of my laptop to install the program because I could not install it from the link Amazon sent me! After the day of phone calls and allowing Microsoft to control my computer to install it, I have had no problems using it and recommend the program to anyone that is a college student.
976	0	I only rated this 3 stars because it won't let me go past a certain point.  Can't design anything.
977	-1	The new platform is t as good as the old where you could actually access your files and browse now you have to download files to even check them
978	0	just ok
979	-1	No piece of software should be this expensive. There are free alternatives that are just as powerful, and this pricing is very prohibitive for small businesses.
980	0	I've been a long time Quicken user. I like this program; it helps me keep organized and plan future expenses, keep track of our finances, etc. It hasn't changed much over the years, except in looking more modern with every new version. I think it's getting expensive, without adding much functionality to justify the price increase.
981	-1	This is a great product for photographers, however, I would like to re-iterate what many other reviewers have said here. DO NOT buy this plan from amazon as there is some serious technical issue in the communication channel between Amazon and Adobe.<br /><br />I tried to subscribe it twice with an existing adobe ID on which I was running the trial plan and it did not work. I then created a new adobe ID through amazon and I was able to subscribe successfully. However, after a month and half, amazon abruptly cancelled the plan without my consent. Keep in mind that this plan offers Lightroom mobile - a killer feature that lets you sync low res version of photos to a sharable cloud. Canceling your plan at the wrong time may risk loosing all those photos.<br /><br />I subscribed to this plan during the prime day sale with a $40 amazon credit that was still due. I was able to get that credit (and another $10 inconvenience credit) after haggling with customer care execs, however, I do not want to renew the subscription through amazon. I went and subscribed to it through adobe. That is what I recommend everyone to do until amazon sorts this issue out.<br /><br />As far as the product is concerned, its pretty stellar. You get the latest version of Lightroom and Photoshop. I use Lightroom for all my post processing needs and it works great with RAW files.
982	0	First off, I'll say that I am a fan of Lightroom and have been using it since Version 3.  It is my go-to program for importing / editing / storing photos both from my Canon DSLR and my family's smartphones.<br /><br />However, I was unhappy about how long Adobe took to fix glaring issues in their previous Lightroom 5, and now Adobe's new policies for Lightroom 6 are another thorn in my side.  Specifically, the policy that standalone versions of Lightroom 6 will get no feature updates is just a poor way to treat new and long-time Lightroom customers.<br /><br />Looking at updates to the *previous* Lightroom 5, there were bug fixes of course, but Lightroom also gained the following functions:<br />- Lightroom 5.2: added Feather control for the Clone/Heal brush, added Smoothness adjustment slider for Color Noise Reduction.<br />- Lightroom 5.4: added support for Lightroom Sync.<br />- Lightroom 5.7: added integrated Aperture/iPhoto importer.<br />Nothing huge, but definitely some useful features.<br /><br />Now with Lightroom 6, features added to the CC (subscription) version are being specifically excluded from the standalone product.  The first of these is the Dehaze slider, but I guess there will be others in the future.  And once again my opinion of a good product is marred by the poorly thought out and greedy policies of Adobe.  I'm not sure what the correct policy is - but I do know that the current policy is the wrong one.<br /><br />I've read in a few places that Adobe claims the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 prevents them from adding new features to products already paid for.  However, this flies in the face of real world examples from the small (Angry Birds supplying many new levels for the initial 99 cent purchase) to the quite large (Microsoft giving all Windows 7 and Windows 8 users a free copy of Windows 10).  You need a better excuse, Adobe.<br /><br />Edit - if you've own a previous version of Lightroom *do not* buy the Full version here - buy the Upgrade version directly from Adobe and save $70.version directly from Adobe and save $70.
983	0	Instead of doing away with versions intuit went for a transitional money grab with versions and schedules.
984	0	Have been using it for many years; but, this is my last year. Using the deluxe version met all my needs until this year. I was required to get a $30.00 upgrade for ONE PAGE stock loss carry over.
985	0	Serves the purpose - but expensive product.
986	-1	DO NOT BUY if you contribute to a 457 plan.  This seems to have been a problem for several years and they simply don't care enough to fix it.  If you max out your 403b contribution they will count everything in the 457 as excess and tax it.  This completely eliminates the benefit of contributing to a 457 plan.  Complete waste of money.  It makes you wonder what other errors they have.
987	-1	Very bad.. The VERY BASIC feature, auto sync is not available.
988	-1	TT lost another long-time customer to H&R Block and not coming back.  The last two years with them were a nightmare to complete, then this year became the end with the bait and switch trick!!
989	-1	I purchased this product as a replacement for Microsoft Money which is soon discontinuing online account updates.  I should have saved my money and created a manual system for tracking my investments!  While my banking accounts can update with Quicken, none of my investment accounts can.  Apparently this product is aimed at people who use the major brokerage firms only.
990	0	Help process used to be better. Expensive for what you get. Will probably try another tax program next year. Disappointed
991	1	I have been using Norton security for the last 10 years, I was little upset when they changed the format and changed the features. After installing the new version and using it , it's still a great security program. The screen navigation is changed but still very simple to use, they added some security features which are beneficial to fight off some of the latest viruses and malware. What I like about Amazon digital service is that as soon as I paid for the item I can download immediately to my my computers no waiting.
992	1	I love it. It integrates with FB and other social sites. For marketers or those buying leads this program is a must have.
993	1	Was able to load this on 3 pcs with no problems.  It is a step above what came with the computers.
994	0	For software that claims to be an all in one financial manager, I am very disappointed in the investment features. I also feel that the user interface is a down grade from previous products. It is, however, functional.....
995	1	Like most I have been using Microsoft Office  Products for basically ever. I got my wife a new laptop and installed this on it. No surprises. As I said we are Office users.<br /><br />What was surprising is how easy the download from Amazon was. Click her...go to download, click here.....go to activation codes. They have made buying software easy and inexpensive.<br /><br />Also I like the fact that we get a free upgrade to Office 2013 when ever Microsoft releases it. I am already using 2013 pre release that came on my Surface Tablet.
996	-1	Not a happy customer.<br /><br />Continued issues creating a Cloud ID in Quicken 2013. Error Code: HTTP-407<br /><br />On 2/14/2013, I was told that you were aware of the problem and were working on it. I am VERY unhappy with this product because of this issue. I had Quicken 2012, and upgraded to 2013 for this feature alone. I really did not need to upgrade for any other reason. Anybody have an idea when this will be fixed?
997	-1	It didn't work! I tried many times, and I didn't see any result in my computer. Can I have my money back?
998	-1	I live in Minnesota and now I can not file my taxes with Turbo Tax - I have used them for over 8 years
999	1	Fantastic product as usual. Makes my life so much easier. Download was quick and easy.  Saves me time and lots of money.
1000	-1	I should have listened to the feedback but I trusted consumer reports a big mistake.  The product may be very good but I'll never know.  I would never do business with Adobe again.  They have no customer support chat to help you when you need it.  I did speak with someone on the phone at adobe before I purchased this product and they assured me that I could pull up pictures in a large file, select all of the pictures and then resize them.  That did not work, or I can not fugue it out.  Maybe it does work but when the report is due tonight and there is no support then it does not help.  Had to download another product and that worked.  Adobe was available to answer questions about purchasing items just not explaining how they work.  Adobe customer service non-existent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1001	0	It's ok for the price but nothing too great.
1002	-1	Needs a course code. If your instructor hasn't made a course you are screwed. I don't know why you can't use it independently. Just the flash cards etc...
1003	1	like a champ!
1004	0	Receive the wrong key and  program would not work. Only after several emails and phone calls<br />they gave me another key which did work, but still only for one computer. Really!learn from I need the emedia piano 2 because the first is just the basics. No thanks, I will just learn from YouTube.
1005	1	Great program for photographers, the price is good also.
1006	0	I didn't feel like Turbo Tax was as clear and convenient to use this year. The IRA distribution section as an example. Also there were no email status reports for my refund. Finally the healthcare insurance coverage section was very confusing.
1007	-1	Bought this thinking it was for a year of service but it was not.Who pay's $20 dollor's a month for internet security that's $240 a year.my laptop cost about $400,i try'd contacting them and got no where's.I guess it was a good thing because every 30 min something pop's up from norton on my computer screen.so after uninstalling it-i still cant get rid of their hot key or something like that,not to computer nifty.
1008	1	"Admittedly I made the mistake of trying to compare Quicken 2015 for Mac with Quicken 2007 causing several hours of frustration; NOTHING alike. I have been keeping dual data within both versions to verify dependability of 2015.  Initially I felt the listing of all the accounts in the sidebar to the left awkward. But, after several \\""help\\"" searches and quicken blogs I find not not being required to open a ledger to do entries a helpful feature. I did not like not being able to open the 2007 data on the same computer as the 2015 data once I converted the data. I opened the data file on my external USB drive and am able to get them to co-exist. I have the first conversion corrupted during the download install because of an update message during the install. I did another conversion then went to the title bar and the drop down and deleted the original. It would be helpful for Quicken to either keep downloads up to date or program the conversion to notify of the update after the conversion is completed. As I continue to become more familiar with this version I feel more comfortable using it. I biggest dislike it report interface. I was more comfortable with the 2007 but I decide to go with the 2015 because once software are \\""updated\\"" most often the \\""we are ending support for......\\"" information will follow shortly."
1009	0	Its basic financial software
1010	0	important worksheets needed to complete the return was not included, and when trying to download updates to get the worksheets it didn't download the worksheets either
1011	-1	This was installed by my son while I was sick and returning from the hospital.  I was not happy with the software.  I had various problems with it and it has now been removed. I would not recommend it to others unless they are very knowledgeable  about Quicken 2014 or wish to really investigate it before installation.  The fix in removing it was a real mess since I had to deal with people in India.  What I have left is the results of my old Quicken 2012 and the details of my investments are not very good--indeed!<br />Thanks,<br />GJS
1012	0	Download was fast and easy product is helping  !!!
1013	-1	As soon as I downloaded this software, it greatly slowed down my computer. I tried to adjust the settings a bit but no can do. Then you have to put your computer in safe mode just to remove it!!!! Now I got Norton 360. I love it!!!
1014	1	I have used this for over ten years. I have never had a virus on my systems. I have installed it on people's systems that have Norton, McAffee, etc... countless times and found viruses they have missed. If you do not have the money to spend on a comprehensive solution... this free version is a great option
1015	0	I was a bit disappointed with the variety of logo choices.  It was easy to use, but I was still wishing for more.
1016	-1	Run away!  After spending over an hour with Intuit's chat-based tech support, I never made it beyond the registration screen.  There seems to be a problem with the registration process that is discussed on the forums.  The tech who was helping me did not seem familiar with the product and ultimately just gave up.  I have never had a product so flawed that I couldn't even get beyond the registration.
1017	0	After installing it asked me for a customer ID and password to install the state module.  I didn't have a customer ID or password...  Once I closed the install state dialog box it asked me to register, after completing registration they emailed me the customer ID and password needed.<br /><br />TaxAct: maybe prompt users to register before asking for a username and password they don't have.<br /><br />More details to follow...
1018	1	It's Kaspersky....does it's job rather nicely.  I was using another but I found a good deal on Kaspersky for 5 pc's and I couldn't pass it up.  This is my 2nd purchase.  I think I'm going to stick with them for a while.  Not system heavy, doesn't tax your machine.
1019	-1	They do poorly at Adware. I had to buy another program
1020	0	I am a long time user too and was using 2010 version and was very satisfied.  I was forced to upgrade to 2013 and am disappointed in this particular feature of 2013.  For investments, the default view is the detailed transactions when it used to be the summary view showing the # of shares, price per share and total value.  This made complete sense since 99% of the time that (summary) is what you first want to see.  Now, you see the detailed transactions and have to click to go to the summary.  Sounds petty, but its counterintuitive and annoying.
1021	1	I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. I have been using Avast for over three years and now never experienced an issue.
1022	1	Have used TurboTax for many years now and still like it very much. Our return includes two rentals and the sale of a third house and all three were seamlessly meshed with our regular income and pension. I especially like the carryover from earlier years, which for the rentals is quite important. Filed our return and received refund less than two weeks later.
1023	1	I've always used Norton since 2009 Best Security for me.<br />Never had any problems with it.<br />Thank You,<br />Debbie Cowden
1024	0	I have had Trend Micro brand security for almost 10 years, and it has been super.  I bought the Titanium version in June 2011, from Amazon, and I don't find it as user friendly. I scheduled two kinds of scans, but when I checked the console later, this new version doesn't say when the last scan took place. I finally found the scan dates in the log. Also I had some trouble understanding how to set up the scans, which had been really easy in the earlier version.  I like that it automatically updates itself, so I know I always have the latest protection, and their reviews on the web are great.  So I am getting what I really need it for, and I'll be okay with the rest.
1025	-1	One can not imagine a cloud file storage without folder sync. However, My favorite Amazon does. It is free and useless.
1026	0	My old version was not compatible with the newer version of Windows, so this met my needs. If you plan to upgrade your computer (like I did) you will most likely need a newer version of Quicken, and this version worked for me.
1027	-1	These get outdated too often and cost too much. iPhones take over need for Garmins anymore.
1028	0	What can one say? Microsoft continues to add bells and whistles to the standard office software and it gets more complicated rather than easier. But we must use what they produce as older versions don't always work on the new 64 bit computers. Still it is the best thing available.
1029	0	Works as usual.  Wish it had more functionality such as adding up business expense categories for those of us that don't use bookkeeping software.
1030	1	Installed and opened my file from Quicken 2014. Perfect and no issues.
1031	0	Every year seem to get less for the money and have to pay for extras like State e-filing.
1032	1	The download was a pain. Once the download was completed, everything was fine. Next time I will opt for the disk being mailed.
1033	1	The best! Never had a problem with my PC since I started using Avast. I would definitely recommend to others.
1034	0	The process went okay, but I had what seemed like a virus problem later (not connected to this antivirus software?)  I reinstalled my software back to a point before Avast was downloaded, and the &#34;virus&#34;problem vanished (don't necessarily blame the problem on Avast).
1035	1	Free, and it works well.
1036	1	Works fine! Doesn't come with Outlook. That was disappointing! And that is why I gave 4 out of 5 stars
1037	0	This software is just okay. It does quite a few things for the price, but isn't especially intuitive or use-friendly as is claimed. If I had it to do over again, I would likely purchase a different program.
1038	-1	Pros<br />Can recover SOME of your deleted photos in thumbnail resolution though<br />Can recover SOME of your deleted notes, contacts etc.<br /><br />Cons<br />The program has a hidden limit of 6 devices per licence which is not mentioned anywhere on their website. When contacted they proposed I should buy the no-limit edition (nowhere to be found on their site) for the discounted price of $327.24!!!<br />This can be compared to a scam.<br /><br />Summary<br />The software does what any experienced user can do in a convenient way.<br />Untrustworthy company. Stay away if you need to recover more than 6 devices.
1039	-1	I gave Quicken a go despite the negative reviews I have seen.  What a waste this program includes ads for products I have no interest in, I am unable to reliably download my information from my bank (the primary reason I wanted software) and the tools provided work, but are very limited.    My suggestion, save your money Quicken is not worth it.  Feel free to suggest alternatives since all the best ones seem to have died off.  Buxfer is dead, Mint is dead, Microsoft Money is dead.... and Quicken is on its way to the grave.
1040	0	avast was recommended by acomputer repair guy....he told me it will not slow my computer down like norton.  It keeps my computer up to date without lots of maintanence.
1041	0	Price could be a bit cheaper.
1042	1	No problems on a Mac. The program worked well, updated fine, and filed the taxes on time. The Amazon download delivery system worked perfectly.
1043	0	I've used Quicken for years. I briefly tried other products but once you are familiar with something, others have to knock your socks 'toff to get you to change. It does what I need it to do and I keep finding things that it can do that I didn't realize it could. I was not wild about the mandatory upgrade. But I lost all download capability with all my financial institutions and had no choice. If this type of thing continues to come up, I'll see about using the internet based programs.
1044	-1	It just sucked! Hated the app!
1045	0	I was migrating versions of Quicken from Quicken 2011 to Quicken 2013.  I would say I was a little disappointed.  I wasn't able to upgrade using my current file.  Luckily I had  backup (I lost a couple months of data).  After installing I started reading about a lot of problems.  I upgraded, but there are still a few flaky things that happen when using the product.  I have high hopes that it will get better with upcoming updates, but I was hoping for better when I made this purchase.
1046	1	I have been using H&R Block Tax Cut for years. I am comfortable with the results. The interview screens allow you to quickly scan for applicability and then move on. Purchasing it at a reasonable price always seems to be a challenge,though and getting it through their re-sellers seems to offer the most reasonable price.
1047	0	it's OKay!
1048	1	Turbotax is extremely easy to use and I received my tax return 10 days after filing. I also like that I can use the software for other family members, which helps save money during tax season.
1049	0	Had to by this so I could continue to download my bank accounts.  I can download, but it will not reconcile to the banks balance without a workaround.  Not happy.  Support was not much help.  Spent an hour chatting and still have problems.  NOT HAPPY!
1050	-1	I use turbo tax without problems and I am happy to continue, however I do agree with the complaints that repeat users who continue to purchase this product (because it easily imports all of your tax information from the previous year) are gouged on the price.  I almost downloaded this exact software package last night for $38 but ran out of time, now it costs $10 more.  Ridiculous!!  What does it really cost to download this software????
1051	0	This is better than the previous version for Mac but still not as user friendly as the PC Quicken I used in the past.  Probably not worth the upgrade price.
1052	1	good antivirus, thanks
1053	1	Literally the best prep for this exam!
1054	-1	I have used Quicken for so long I don't even remember when I started.  I do have data files back to 2000.  I used to update every year and then every two as there was little difference between versions.  I started to update last year until scared off by the terrible reviews.  I have checked the reviews often since then and it appears to be improving but still buggy.  When it comes to finances, buggy is UNACCEPTABLE.  I am surprised Amazon even sells a product that scores so poorly.<br /><br />So now the 2014 version is released and off to rocky start.  I am really getting antsy as I've read Intuit will obsolete my 2011 version after three years.  The only PLUS I see here is that Intuit is now bothering to read and respond to the reviews.  Maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel.
1055	1	Ive used Kaspersky Internet Security for years now and it never disappoints! And the Amazon price is great too!
1056	1	I have done my own taxes since I had my first job and wasn't a dependent (a lot of years ago). Turbo Tax has cut days off my effort and is as accurate or more so than any returns I have ever done.  The first year I used Turbo Tax, I also figured my taxes without Turbo Tax. I will never do that again.  It walks you through every line and knows when to bring in more questions and fill out worksheets. It does all the math. It checks all the entries and looks for all the ways to save you money. It is like have a tutor or tax accountant helping you, but you don't have to pay extra for the help.
1057	-1	Don't buy this!  I had nothing else open on my computer and it kept freezing up to the point where I was unable to edit my music at all.  I kept having to close it and open it again and it kept freezing up in the middle of playing a song.  Junk!!!  I wish there was an option for zero stars.
1058	1	Use it every year.  Had to go to forms view to get the correct entry entered as the interview didnt address my investment in my MLP correctly.
1059	-1	couldn't get the program to work on my iMac.
1060	1	It works a little differently than QB for PC, but on the whole it meets our needs.
1061	0	I find that the help materials are becoming less helpful.  There are things in my taxes that I still don't understand that should have been easy.  These include filing status assistance for a married couple (seperate, joint, head of household), tuition payment deductibility for my child, etc.  There are also far too many questions for things that don't relate to an average working class american, like farm tax credits.  I think that there should be a setting for &#34;normal white collar american&#34; that basically skips all the nonsense.  .
1062	0	Poor documentation of changes. Difficult to adjust from clearer, 2007 program. I do like the Cloud back-up and reporting features.
1063	1	This is an easy to use reliable product. Once I downloaded the product and installed it, it prompts you to download updates and the free State version. It pulled the information from my previous year Tax Return and the step by step process to complete my tax return was easy and thoroughly comprehensible. This year, efiling for the State was also free, which was a pleasant surprise.  It was not in previous years. This is a good, reliable product and an economical way of doing your taxes. I would recommend this to anyone and I will continue using this product to complete my annual tax returns.
1064	1	I have to say that anything to avoid buying microsoft office is great, but if you have the money, buy office. Nothing beats the original version, however, this is one of the better clones.
1065	1	An improvement.
1066	-1	Without telling anyone they removed the schedule C from the package.  I received an email apologizing and an offer for a $25.00 rebate.  Unfortunately, by then I had purchased the Premier version.  After I filed I went to the link to get the $25.00 and after filling in my info got a message that they had no information to issue the credit, but had a number to call if you were having problems.  I called the number and got a message that if you were calling about the rebate you would have to call after April 20th.  So after the 20th I tried again and got the message that the offier expired at midnight on April .  Obviously they had no intention of issuing any rebates.  I've used TurboTax for 15 years, but won't buy it again.
1067	-1	Purchased, downloaded, and installed without issue.  Opened first time and was prompted for registration info including key.  Copied and pasted the key into the reg screen and it accepted but software stuck in demo mode.  Worked with support for a week going back and forth.  Tried uninstalling, reinstalling, and tried on 3 separate pc's (Win XP, Win7 and Win 8)to rule out any type of operating system issue. Still no luck. I would definitely avoid.  Not sure if it registers correctly if you buy directly from them or not.
1068	-1	The program created a boot disk for the computer to reset it's password, but when I put it into the computer it said oops, no operating system found and then it suggested that I buy its upgraded version for 40 dollars more because it's more compatible.  No way to contact seller or to get a refund that I can see.  I was straight robbed....
1069	1	I have used H & R Block software from Amazon for the second year in a row and I found it to be easy to obtain and cost effective.  Thank you!
1070	1	I have been using this software since its inception.  It was originally developed by Best Software in Virginia, and has gone through several owners and name changes. It gets better every year.
1071	1	easy to use and quick response
1072	1	I had a very old version (1996!) and needed to buy a new one for my new computer. Although there are more bells and whistles now, I miss some old elements. For instance, there are certain entries it does not memorize, and in Savings, there does not seem to be an option for type of transaction (although perhaps there is a way to add this, which I have not yet found).<br /><br />Still, I love Quicken in general for the ability to keep track of budgeting, spending, my bank account balances, etc. I've used it for years (clearly!)
1073	0	I worked at Intuit for 6 years and now compete with TurboTax with my own tax software company (https://common-form.com), so read my review with that in mind.<br /><br />TurboTax is a fine product and is the market leader for a reason. It does many things well, but being transparent on price has never been one of them. There's a huge team of people at Intuit dedicated to A/B testing pricing, up-sells, and cross-sells so they can extract the most money possible from each customer. I'm not at all surprised to see them make this decision.<br /><br />It is for reasons like this that my partners and I left TurboTax and started Common Form. Our pricing is fair and transparent. The price you see at the beginning is the price you pay at the end, with one exception. If you owe the IRS additional taxes, you don't owe us a dime.<br /><br />Currently we're focused on people with relatively simple finances, so we don't support schedule D. But anyone who files the 1040EZ and is sick of TurboTax’s sneaky pricing should come check us out.
1074	0	The download worked fine with the exception that it will not let me print it. I am unable to change the location where to send it so it will print. Any help you can give me in this area would be greatly appreciated.
1075	-1	There is no use of buying not because the programme has a problem but it's better to taxes online at there Turbo tax site. Thumbs down on a idea buying from Amazon. Turbo tax are pretty cheap too.
1076	1	Pros:  Works for me and you can leave the other features on or off.  So far, it has caught all the viruses before they affected my computer and if you need more protection, you can get their Internet Security at a resonable price.<br /><br />Cons: Keeps trying to sell you features, but for free, can't complain.<br />- Every now and then, it doesn't want to update but I've uninstalled and reinstalled, which worked.<br />- They don't have a feature for &#34;No advertising&#34; at a small cost, like with iTunes purchases.
1077	1	Intuit continues to amaze with each new release of their Quickbooks product line. Have been using their products for years and enjoy the latest releases and latest technologies included! Have personally recommended to friends and once they tried it out, they have purchased and enjoyed equally! Thanks Intuit!
1078	-1	Worst check software I have ever used. MS Money was so simple to use, this thing fights you on every transaction. I wish I could return this and get my money back.
1079	-1	I've been a user of Adobe products for 20 years, and this version is the biggest betrayal of their users I've ever seen.  You CANNOT use this software unless you create an account on the Adobe site AND remain logged in to it at all times.  If you attempt to log out of your account, it will display a message that the software will be deactivated on the machine it is currently installed on.<br /><br />On top of this, performance has become a huge issue, probably because Adobe is sending reports to home over the network on everything you do.  Note Adobe automatically records all of your activities with the software, unless you go to your account on their site and change your settings.  I've never seen Elements behave this way before.  Every once in a while, when you move your mouse, the mouse lags behind your movements by 1-4 seconds.  INCREDIBLY annoying.  So, even though I have opted out, I am still having an occasional issue with mouse movement delay, which makes me wonder how opted out I really am.  I really wish I had NOT upgraded.  More money and WORSE performance.  Ugh.
1080	0	only let me use it for a 30 day trial
1081	0	It was frustrating to have to change from Money to Quicken; however, I needed something to keep my finances in order.  I have found this version of Quicken to be pretty buggy compared to Money.  I think the extra's are over the top.  I wish you could have a bare bones interface, but I'm sure that is asking to much.  Wouldn't recommend.
1082	0	The tax program works well and its very easy to use.  Online support after filing, however, is not consistent.  Notification of my filing was the only communication I received.  In past years, notifications included (1) when the return was accepted by the feds / state; (2) when the return was processed.  I had to check my bank account periodically to see if the refund had been posted.  Nothing from Turbotax.<br /><br />Then, the Colorado fiasco!  I understand that mistakes are made, but Turbo-tax has not communicated about this except in the news.  No messaging.  No notices.  I've been a member for about 10 years, and I'm not happy.<br /><br />Still no CO refund as of this posting 3/6/2015
1083	0	Not super easy to install, somewhat cumbersome if you are used to the CD install. Did the initial installation. Have not tried (yet) the other two. Needed NIS 2014 due to new computer with WIndows 8.1 so options were limited.
1084	-1	Why does the package say this is for a Mac and the description states it is for windows? (One star for the confusion)
1085	1	This program is very user friendly...it has become a holiday favorite of my family. I use it every Easter & Christmas & sometimes in between to create treasure hunts...the clues come in a variety of age appropriate(ness)...is that even a word?! I love it! Thanks, Oak Norton!!!
1086	0	"Very similar to quickbooks for windows, as you'd expect.  All the standard quickbooks features work pretty much as you'd expect except:    1.  Downloading transactions from the internet.  I have never been able to get this to work right, and the mechanism is different than other versions of intuit products.  When importing the downloaded file, it swaps fields around, so the payee is always either \\""Deposit\\"" or \\""Withdrawal\\"", and the \\""Memo\\"" line contains the data my bank has on the actual payee, ie \\""Intuit.com\\"" etc, so I have to manually edit each entry anyway in order to get them to record appropriately.  It's faster to just manually enter each entry (i.e. it's slow and a pain.)    2.  Budgeting.  Instead of presenting you with a worksheet that lists all of your accounts, customers/jobs, and classes, and letting you enter budgeted amounts for each one for any given month, the \\""set up budgets\\"" window is limited to editing one particular account, customer/job, or class at a time, so it's basically useless.    That said, it lets me create and track invoices, bills, estimates, etc., as you'd expect, which is a huge timesaver."
1087	0	Quicken Deluxe 2013 is just OK.  It seems to have a lot of features but I don't find it particularly easy to use.  Plus I HATE Intuits forced upgrade policy, where they cripple perfectly useful software to force you into upgrading.
1088	-1	It completely sucks..... Amazon would not help... The download once installed would not open. I just wasted ten bucks on this junk! Amazon should not allow them to have this on their site at all !!!!!!!
1089	0	I was looking for a replacement to Microsoft Streets and Trips since MS is ending that product.  Although DeLorme has been in the map business for many years, I don't like the UI at all.  I was using Windows 8 on a Surface Pro 2, which I feel was more than enough to power this application.  However, it maxed my CPU out with using it with an external GPS unit that is recommended by DeLorme.
1090	-1	Customer Service horrible and clinch in software!  I spent over 4 hours on the phone with customer service between hold and the rep trying to help me.  It you have a 1099R for a rollover you will  have problems.  I was told I would get a phone call back in 48 to 72 hours, 7 days later I received an e-mail and I had to call them only to spend another 15 minutes on the phone to tell them I went with another software because of their poor customer service.  Other software cost more but it is worth it.
1091	1	So much cheaper than renewing through Norton. The instant download makes it so much faster than buying the software at a store.
1092	0	Not bad as any &#34;xxx for Mac&#34; product can be.  I'm able to do what I need to so I'm satisfied, although the desktop for PC is much better.
1093	1	excellent product
1094	0	not very user friendly,could be better,Luckily i got this download free from Amazon other wise i would have not bought this
1095	-1	This software does not work. Amazon supports these shyster's by selling the product. This should have worked as a DVD to Ipad ripper. Which is not illegal since it is for your private use & you paid for the DVD. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1096	1	once you learn the new material and the new updates it will be an easy asset to keeping records in proper placing for compilement
1097	1	I have several small businesses and this version of TT worked out just great for me.  I didn't need the Small Business version but then I've done this kind of filing previously so I didn't need the step-by-step version.
1098	1	Have used this program for years, and needed an update for a new computer.
1099	1	Ok, I've had this for a while now, and it feel pretty close to the 2010 version, but with a few upgrades here and there. Would I pay $140 to upgrade? Probably not. Thankfully, I didn't have to. I paid $10 over on their Home Use Program Site [[...]] when I entered in my work email, and found out my company was part of their volume license program. I'd rather see people get it for $10, if they are going to get it at all.
1100	1	Love the program and always get easy results and the best tax refunds.  Been using this for years now.  This program is definitely worth the investment to make taxes easier and much quicker.  Plus the E-File option makes the returns quick as well.  Highly recommend this software.
1101	1	Great product, great price as opposed to what else is out there. Will handle a number of w2's and 1099's, which works for me. Being paid by different companies. Updates are automatic. Works well for my business...
1102	1	It's extremely user-friendly. Updates and daily downloads are without problems, at least for me. I would purchase it once again.
1103	1	Easy to setup and use.  Have had no issues so far.  Doesn't seem to slow my computer down too much.
1104	1	It is good.  I still like Microsoft Money better, but this works and I like the new changes that are in this edition
1105	0	I am starting job soon where QuickBooks is used and wanted to train myself a few weeks ahead of time. I read through many of these products on Amazon and decided to go with the download version of this product. The tutorial aspect is fine but there is no practice lesson to accompany the videos. I guess this is aimed more to small business owners who already own QuickBooks and can practice at home or work. I had to download the free trial online and toggle back and forth to practice. The download does not look the same as the tutorial and is not worth the $40 in my case. I wish they made it more clear that this is not a schooling product but rather a companion for people who already own QuickBooks.
1106	0	It is somewhat easy but still seems a bit jumbled.  If you already have some knowledge of Spanish, I can see how this might be a useful tool to help you brush up.
1107	-1	I am completely dissatisfied with this product.  I use Intuit payroll service in coordination with Quicken and the payroll info will not download into Quicken 2015.  Intuit says there is a compatibility issue with Quicken 2014 and 2015.  This is so disappointing considering they are the same company.  It has cost me lost of time to make the upgrade and then subsequently go back to my old Quicken software so I could get my work done.  I would really like my money back.<br />.
1108	1	Well heck, it's Internet Security, everyone's favorite thing to waste money on. None of them are perfect, some of the free ones are pretty good, but as a pro in the field I think this one is better than most if not all at keeping the crap off of your machine. Given the price on Amazon I find Norton to be worth the money. A few years ago, Norton got real heavy handed and resource intensive and I threw it out of my repertoire, but around 2009 they fixed it and it has remained fixed with a very light footprint and an excellent detection rate. It's what I use and I'm happy with it.
1109	1	2015 Quicken Deluxe is the best version of Quicken yet.
1110	0	I found that the 2011 version of Quicken Deluxe was a step back in the feature that I cared about. In particular the default view for stocks is the transactions view and not the holdings view. The companies defends this position by saying that the holdings view couldn't be resized as a window. I didn't want to resize it, and I found that view to be much more helpful than just looking at the most recent transactions.    I also found the update connection with my bank (SDCCU) to be buggy. For what ever reason I can no longer get my bank transactions to download with my transactions from my other financial institutions. I have to use the update transactions under the account actions button to get this program to connect to my bank. When I do that the bank forces me to answer three security questions (every time) when I didn't have to do that before.    The 2011 version offers more user customization but I see that as not being particularly beneficial.    I would rather have Quicken deluxe 2009 than this program
1111	0	Not as good as I thought, very basic but good for the price.
1112	1	I have used TurboTax for many years, always the Basic level ... but even Basic had gotten rather expensive. Took a shot at H&R Block because it was about half the price of the least expensive TT I could find. Download, installation, and on-line update went smoothly. The functionality of the product was very similar to TT. I was able to complete the long form, complete with vehicle expenses and a Schedule C for my wife's business with no problems. E-file went through without a hitch and I got my refund direct-deposited just as quickly as usual. Will buy it again next year.
1113	-1	I'm a long term Quicken user.  I had some errors I wanted to correct at my leisure in my old data and wanted a fresh start for 2015.  This Quicken would not let me have two Quicken programs (old and new) on my computer at the same time.  Totally defeated my purpose in buying the new one which I am not using.  I solved the problem by getting Moneydance for the new data.
1114	-1	This product did absolutly nothing to clean my registry..Cant even get them to email me back...Don't waste your money . I want mine back
1115	-1	OK, I have used turbo tax for years to file my personal taxes.  So I thought hey how bad can it be to start a partnership and do my business taxes with turbotax. HUGE MISTAKE! I purchased this software back in early February, tried to efile and the option was not even available at the time.  Ok so I wait for updates and more updates and here I am 04/12/2013 and still not being able to efile.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!<br /><br />ITS OVERPRICED AND SITTING HERE GOING ON 62 MINUTES ON HOLD WHATEVER I PAYED OR SAVE VERSUS SIMPLY CALLING A BOOKKEEPER OR CPA IS ENFURIATING<br />I WOULD SIMPLY HANG UP AND CALL A CPA IF IT WOULD BE SO SIMPLE EXCEPT I HAVE ALREADY HANDED OUT 1099S AND K-1S<br />I WILL SIMPLY WAIT TO FINISH THIS REVIEW WHEN I SPEAK TO A LIVE OPERATOR.<br />70 MINUTES AND NOTHING!<br />80 MINUTES AND GOD MY EARS HURT FROM THE RETARDED HOLD MUSIC!<br />90 MINUTES.....COME AND GONE<br />100 MINUTES AND I GIVE UP<br /><br />SAVE YOURSELF AND THIS STUPID AND UNNECESSARY AGGREVATION!
1116	1	Excellent
1117	1	It appears that all questions were asked and if most instances explained on request.  I had no trouble going through the exercises and in the end felt like I sent in an honest tax return
1118	1	There is nothing like it for the easy design and development of publications. It requires little expertise. Now if only they made it for the Mac.
1119	0	I still have all kinds of problems with my laptop, like the pointer going crazy, the page on the screen jumping bigger and smaller like Alice in Wonderland. And, it is very slow, almost stopped, when Avast is doing anything. It may be my lack of computer skills. I stopped learning when my kids took over as teens a long time ago. Now that they are grown, I'm obsolete on the computer. If you're a computer whiz, Avast may be great. I don't know.
1120	0	Although using Turbo Tax is better than doing it by hand. the latest version is clunky, has errors, and takes a lot of time to complete. It has gotten worse over the years so this will be my last year using it. Next year I will switch
1121	-1	"To all appearances, this was a license.  Turned out to be a \\""free\\"" trial, so you are paying for a program that you get for free elsewhere- run like the wind."
1122	-1	I purchased this product from a local office supply store several months ago. Then my computer crashed and I had to use the recovery disks which cleared a lot of info from my harddrive.  Got the computer up and running and Norton error message said product key expired. . . .  three days ago I purchased Norton security online and it was installed from AMAZON.  It is installed on my computer but now  NORTON error message says I have a 15 day trial period and would I like to purchase now.  I requested product assistance from NORTON home page,  no response.  soooo NO response from Norton, and I have already paid for and downloaded the Norton 2012. I will not purchase the product again in 15 days.  NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER<br /><br />04-29-12  Update:  Norton never responded to my email requesting assistance.  I had left my email address and ph.number.  Amazon, however, responded within 24 hrs. and resolved the issue.  Thanks Amazon.
1123	1	I renewed it again for another year! It was sorta complicated to navigate how to renew but finally  installed to my computers! Although the icon on my desktop was removed in the renewel process it seems to still do the idle scans! And runs!! I recommend this to anyone, not a fan of McCafee
1124	1	I selected the code to be emailed to me and it was extremely easy and painless to install. Worked like a dream and I am satisfied with the security it is providing. Norton has always worked for my needs. Great price for 5 devices!
1125	0	A little bit harder to maneuver around to tweak than 360. But also more slimmed down so it balances out. And you can do your tweaks you just have to look a little harder.
1126	0	"I've been using Quicken for many years.  It always does the job in a not too impressive fashion.  The 2011 version has some nice features.  I especially appreciate being able to import transactions from my bank accounts. Quicken makes you \\""upgrade\\"" every few years or you lose the ability to download. (Nice guys!)    The program itself acts a bit buggy at times but if you keep trying it will work.    Before I bought Quicken Deluxe 2011 I looked all around for alternatives but did not find anything that would work for me. MS Money is no longer available.  I looked at several others including MINT.  The big problem with all of the others (that I found) is that they keep your transaction data on their \\""cloud\\"".  Transactions made more than 90 days or so before the current date are not available. Makes it tough come Tax time."
1127	-1	"Quicken turns out to be crippleware!<br />This is unbelievable. Up until now, people used their Quicken as long as they liked it, upgrading only when they chose to. The only thing they might lose was Intuit \\""support\\"" which was a joke anyway. Here I am perfectly happy with my version of Quicken Essentials for the Mac on my machine, and Quicken 2012 for Windows on hers, and along comes Intuit and tells us they are going to intervene between us and our banks and credit card companies and cut off our right to have our EXISTING versions of our PAID-FOR software connect to our financial institutions unless we each buy upgrades that may or may not work as well! As a consumer, I question the wisdom of this move; and, were I to submit and buy these so-called upgrades, how long do we get to use them before Intuit threatens to cut off our links to our financial institutions again unless we buy the next \\""upgrade\\"" and the next and the next?"
1128	1	I use this product every year and it really is easy to use. Its a great way to tray expenses and deductions year to year whereas using notes and prior printed returns would be difficult to track.
1129	0	This is tough.  The program itself is much better in terms of features and functions in the check register and investing.  However this version has crashed more then any release I can remember
1130	0	"As a long time devotee of Quicken products, I have come to rely on them enthusiastically for my accounting and investment tracking needs.  When Quicken 2014 appeared, I immediately upgraded from 2013 to the new version.  Two problems were immediately apparent -- 1) 2014 takes significantly longer to execute on my machine (a 64-bit PC running Windows 7.  As I go from account to account or operation to operation, it seems Quicken 2014 has to stop and \\""think about it\\"" before moving on.  2) as one whose eyesight is failing, I can only read the fonts for the account list, home page and and one step upgrade summaries with great difficulty.  I have easily adjusted the register fonts, but not those of the rest of the display.  The \\""large fonts\\"" option under \\""preferences\\"" does not change non-register fonts.<br /><br />Quicken as a financial tool is perfect for my purposes, however, if the difficulties of using it worsen (e.g., especially the GUI), I will have to look for another solution to my accounting needs."
1131	0	I was &#34;forced&#34; into this purchase since Quicken 2011 no longer would support downloads from financial institutions.  I was very satisfied with the performance of 2011 but had to change.  The download of Quicken 2014 posed no problems.  It was seamlessly downloaded and activated.  However, there were problems with the downloading of financial data, the very reason I purchased it in the first place.  I had to go to the message boards to fins a solution to my not being able to download data.  Quicken should include at least a readme doc to explain what you need to do.
1132	0	I'm pretty sure this will be very helpful to me as an office program, I just haven't used it much.
1133	-1	After having purchased it from Amazon, my computer was still infected by a virus; and when Kaspersky was contacted, via email, was given 5 days to answer; and since I was out of town could not do so, however they closed the case.<br />Would not recommend this product to anyone for security of their computer!!!
1134	0	After a few snags, I think I got my returned figured out.  However, I was one of those people who were &#34;tricked&#34; into paying $30 to upgrade to the Premier version, after having bought Deluxe on Amazon.  Product works alright, but I'll probably be going back to a CPA next year.
1135	-1	What a waste of money and time! Not only this software does not include the essentials this year, but it is just broke all together!!! Not syncing the previous years! In addition, a software update doesn't work!!! Not user-friendly!
1136	-1	I have been unable to download and install this program.  I've been trying for almost a week now.  So disappointed!!!
1137	0	"Upgraded from Quicken Premier 2014, hoping that the terrible display formatting on high resolution devices would be fixed; in my case, using the previous version on a Samsung laptop with 3200 x 1800 resolution, the font sizes were barely readable, or so large than only a tiny fraction of the screen was usable.    Font sizing issue is fixed, which is nice.    Upgrade process was quick and seamless.    Other functionality is much the same, it seems. There are still regular crashes for no apparent reason.    Quicken is a decent product, but (as many others have noted), it is somewhat buggy and unstable.    Update: this is without a doubt the most unstable, unreliable software I have ever used. Online updates regularly fail, the software crashes often for no apparent reason, and the \\""fix\\"" provided by the help system often results in such joys as existing accounts being duplicated instead of the existing account being repaired, with the attendant loss of accurate expense categorization entered over the life of the account. A case study in the perils of a lack of competition... I shall continue to look for a better alternative."
1138	-1	After numerous years as a satisfied customer...NO LONGER!  The change in TruboTax business model to essentially take key, common schedules and split them to different levels requires the user to pay substantially more!  The new name of this should be called TurboCharge!
1139	0	It still has too many loop-holes, the worst being that when you get stuck, there is no one to call or write except others who are using the same product, and most of the time that is a joke.
1140	0	Program is perfect for someone wanting to design their own house, but if you want to pruduce your own set of prints ( with details)  it wont let you.  If it is possible to make complete detailed drawings then proper instructions, or more detailed instructions need to be available.
1141	1	"I'm going to make this simple. This works! If you had norton before and your subscription is running out this will replace it. This not a trial you'll get a full year of protection. All you have to do in your amazon account is go to \\""Games and software library\\"" and you'll get the product key. You enter the key and depending on what type of Norton security software you had before, you may have to go through an installation process. Once that is done, (and this is the part that confused me...lol) it may say that your trial subscription has begun and you have 15 days of protection...wrong!! You can get 366 days of protection all you have to do is click on the activate button again in your norton program and it will walk you through setting up a norton account and presto! You will have 366 days of protection for under $10.00. Have I mention that I love Amazon.com? Because I do! I hope that this helps someone."
1142	-1	Worst customer service...  Called in for help on upgrading and could not understand Turbo tax representative. He then connected us to another department where we were put on hold for 34 minutes!!!!  Joke!!!!
1143	-1	With all the free stuff in the app world today, MS still insists on trying to charge lots of money for an entirely over-done product.<br /><br />Skip it and use something free...
1144	-1	Will not download!
1145	1	I have only used the new version of word and I like the feature change for fluid typing. The programs also respond faster than the 2007 version. I am very impressed.
1146	1	I got Movavi Video Suite as I was looking for a program that will satisfy my savy photo & movie editorial needs. I am absolutely amazed how good the program is. The transitions effects are super cool and easy to implement. I've been using many programs so far and this one does everyting you may need. I recomend it.
1147	0	I got this way back as a demo and installed fine. This time buying<br />from Amazon requires you to edit a config file which I still cannot<br />figure out. I try every few days when I am rested again. Maybe I<br />should chat with the SAM people directly. Heard about it from<br />the book.
1148	-1	Techsmit is a scumbag whenever they come up with new version of their product they make sure they disable your previous version license and it will be nothing but a garbage! be aware this company is a scumbag
1149	1	Good but could be more user friendly
1150	0	Started using the Quicken 2014 Home & Business and after the first time I validated my files it crashed.  The new version is unable to use multiple levels of categories.  The company agrees and issued a refunded.  They said they would fix the problem, but until then it is useless, to me anyway.  They helped me reload my old 2012 version and got me running again.  I never got a chance to use the other features...
1151	1	Would not be able to do my job with out this program.  I work a lot with PDF and need to pull pages and combine, ect.
1152	-1	I have waited for long time for this version hoping that it would be improved from the version I already have which is APE 9.0. But to my astonishment, same old problems still there and the worst of all is its inability to export movies in HD 1080 p, 50 or 60 fps format to match the quality of the new camcorders clips. Editing features and effects are not so bad, but when you export your final movies in HD format you get the worst quality ever. If you want hight quality HD movies forget about Elemnts 12, but if you are still working with DVD SD quality, this Elements is not so bad.
1153	0	just like to spend it, Its a good product to use, easy. I wish I cared more about money and tracking it
1154	1	Timely, accurate, and reasonably priced. What more could you want?<br /><br />A download link that actually downloads the full installer file, not a web installation. I like that.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for once again providing me with great customer service.
1155	1	The 2015 version of Quicken is much improved and, for the first time, it really looks like a program written for Mac computers. I really like the option of updating all accounts at one time.
1156	1	A required software for any computer.  Easy to upload. Not much more to say, appreciate the ease of downloading at home.
1157	1	It's important to READ all of the information that is given to you. The product code you get is a support ID Code. You do not need a product key for this product, you do however need to register with Microsoft Live as well as verify that you are a current student. Not confusing you just have to read carefully and be a little patient
1158	1	Have been using this program on an older computer, so had to buy it again for the new windows 8 one.<br /><br />Needed some help, from the company, and they were there for me..<br /><br />Working fine just like it has for many years...<br /><br />Great program
1159	-1	you will get what you'd pay for. not much you can do with this program. I couldn't do much with this one.
1160	1	Great price
1161	0	My biggest issue was with Amazon's download software - it simply will not work on my PC with XP-64. Just keeps on crashing during installation saying it need admin rights while I am logged in as admin.     The tax software is OK but it imported by data from last year with my with mistakes. I couldn't figure it out until I started reviewing. I also saw inconsistent Federal Tax total. - I added a tax deduction to test how much that will lower my taxes and later removed the deduction but the Federal calculation did not return to the previous value. This was a big surprise to me - fortunately I saved a copy before making changes so I was able to return to the saved copy and the calculation can back - strange.     Overall I rate this OK - and the questions adequate to do the taxes. The State download was named BETA which dosnt give too much confidence even the final version updated 4/8/2010 still says BETA. Its hard to find a better software in my mind - this year all the software's seam to have some kind of issues.
1162	0	While I haven't used the programs heavily yet, most of the products seem to be fine but I paid extra to get Outlook and it doesn't work the same as Outlook on the PC.  On the PC, I was able to sync my calendar with iCloud but it can't be done on the Mac version.  Also, the read receipt feature doesn't seem to be in the Mac version of Outlook. However, Outlook does process iCloud mail (IMAP) much better than the PC version did.
1163	1	It prepared my taxes without issues or problems.  Taxes are so complicated that an adequate package is needed just to file a simple tax situation.  I am retired and still need quite a bit help the package provides me.
1164	-1	Terrible software with a user interface from 1995.  Here's a fun fact: Quicken does not support bank account passwords that contain special characters.  Be prepared to change all your checking and investment account passwords.
1165	-1	Don't bother.  Act used to be a great product.  I started using it in 1996.  The last really good version was somewhere around 2000.  I couldn't get this version to synch with Outlook -  a key feature - and you have to pay for technical support if you want them to help you.<br /><br />This is about the 7th company to buy this software product and with each one it gets buggier and buggier.<br /><br />If anyone has a good alternative I'd love to know what it is.  I'm done with Act in all its versions.
1166	-1	"Based on it's wide usage, and decent reputation, I expected something far easier to use than this. It installed OK and runs, I guess, as it should. When I told it to update my bank accounts, it said that it did, but it didn't. Then I found out that I can't import the files my bank would let me download. Not being an expert I don't know the difference between .qif .qix and whatever else the file extensions were, but what my bank let me download, ( in a Quicken format) Quicken can't \\""see\\"". I think if I \\""upgraded\\"" I could, but I'm more likely to take this program off my PC rather than spend time tilting at windmills."
1167	-1	To qualify to be an Education Customer you have to provide proof to Adobe that you are eligible. That involves sending Adobe a form and proof. When you buy Adobe software from Amazon you have to go to a seperate website and provide information. If you buy Adobe software from Amazon again, like an upgrade from Acrobat X to Acrobat XI, you are not automaticatlly recognized, you have to email to request the serial number in order to liscence the software past a 30 day trial period. If that sounds like a ridiculous pain the rear than the reviews by hacked off buyers will make sense to you. As for the software itself if you have Acrobat X there is no reason whatsoever to change. I suggest that you download the trial version from Adobe and try XI without buying it. If you think its worth it buy. If not let it die. Not Recommended.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The people that verify educaiton users offered to re-verify me requesting about a dozen pieces of information including my home address (maybe they were planning to mail it to me?) Education user verification is apparently seperate from the Adobe account itself. There is a comment to my review from Adobe below. By all means try the software if you want but know what you're getting into as far verification goes. Also, as someone else mentioned, you will have to reinstall Acrobat X if you decide not to buy XI so if you are considering an upgrade you should probably have your X serial number ready just in case.
1168	-1	I skipped a couple of years because of the bugs in the last version I tried (2012). I hated 2012 so much I stopped using it in 3 months and uninstalled it.<br /><br />2015 still has GUI issues throughout the entire application. I am a software developer, so these things stand out really bad. It is a shame they cannot fix any of them in 3 years.<br /><br />The worst though is I am still seeing the same problem with synchronizing my main bank account.  It routinely skips transactions and never downloads them.  If it was only one transaction here or there, that would be easy to find and add manually.  However it always skips more than that. This past week it skipped an entire day and also all deposits for the week before.  Just the deposits for that week.  Finding what is missing when it is that many is cumbersome at best. The only way to easily fix it is to delete the account and add it back.  That always downloads those missing transactions so that means it is not a bank problem. This is not a solution though because then categorizations would need redone each time.<br /><br />Anyway, three years later and many of the same old problems plague version 2015. They really need to hire some management that would at least pretend to know something about software development.
1169	-1	I have had the product for 15 minutes and have not been able to use it, it has been frozen the entire time. I was so excited to use it because it would cross over between my journaling and bible time. Now it looks like I cannot get a refund.
1170	-1	I have numerous screen caps of H&R Block support chat re: this software which is incapable of filing a Federal return for a dead taxpayer. Here I am 4 days out from filing deadline and I cannot file my dead father's return, much less my own. And each rejection by the IRS costs another free-filing option. I have lots of screen caps of this convo with H&R Block. Avoid AMAZON (which H&R calls a scam) and avoid TaxCut as well.
1171	1	I've been using this software since the 90s when it used to be called Kiplinger's Taxcut. It's easy to use, guaranteed accurate, and priced competitively. I've only tried TurboTax once, but discovered it was lacking in features by comparison. I would recommend this to anyone.
1172	0	this is an intermediate math program which is great for beginers or for individuals refreshining there math skills! Im very satisfied with this software. MJC
1173	0	Much better product than Quicken Essentials.  Potential is nice but the sync with iOS is not perfect.
1174	0	Little harder to use than previous editions
1175	-1	I've been using TT for over a decade now. I used to love it, but I've noticed over the years that it has gotten worse and worse in terms of its usability. This year (tax year 2014) take the cake. I have never been more confused by a piece of software, much less one I've been using every year for over a decade. It led me down extremely confusing paths, which in the end were wrong, and cost me significant time and effort, and huge risk if I hadn't persevered through.<br /><br />What a disappointment to see a product devolve and get worse, when it should be getting better and better. Just look at the forums, filled with confused customers. It makes me wonder if the product quality was neglected, in order to get business elsewhere.<br /><br />In any event, I will be looking for alternative solutions next year. I've been loyal for so long, but it just keeps getting more and more confusing every year.
1176	-1	It seems to download alright but the menus are not enabled or working when you go into the program.  Very disappointing --- I am glad I have time to get another product before taxes are due.
1177	-1	Ordered this to use to refile because of some missed deductions.  I thought I could get it cheater but I tried over & over to get it to work but it was defective.  I finally went online and ordered another copy from the original website.
1178	0	"This just in!  \\""INTUIT NOT GREAT MAKER OF MAC SOFTWARE\\""     But, hey, this was an improvement over the 2007 version, to be sure.  It does the job for what both myself and my clients need with only a few minor annoyances (e.g. why does is an invoice marked \\""PAID\\"" in the software, but not when it's printed out or sent to a PDF?  If there is a setting to change this, I can't find it.  Just dumb.)    The COOL thing is being able to download this directly from Amazon.  Very convenient and to be encouraged!"
1179	-1	Buying this product leaves you feeling cheated because one is compelled to upgrade to this product because Turbox crippled the functionality of its Deluxe product
1180	1	just because I have to
1181	0	Product is good! But I was not able to install it from Amazon library. All Office apps crashed. Had to contact Microsoft customer service to download the Office. Spent 2 extra hours.
1182	0	Predictable but thorough.
1183	-1	What a pile of junk.  The free version has zero benefits.  You must purchase the grime fighter to get any clean-up.  Only problem, they require a credit card with an automatic renewal!  Now I am trying to uninstall the software and the program will not let me!  Says I do not have permission.  No number available to contact for help either.  What a SCAM.
1184	-1	This program is buggy. It has a feature to download updates to your accounts each morning. Upon completion I am unable to open the program and am forced to restart my computer in an attempt to open the program. It looses access to accounts frequently and simply does not run smoothly as I would have expected from a program that has been around for years. Disappointing<br /><br />Based on the multiple poor reviews it looks like Kathryn from Quicken will have a job for a long time! Jeesh....
1185	1	I have used it before and like the way it works, tried another program but had too many problems and went back to the Norton 360.
1186	0	Bundle price is 89.95 and individual price is 34.95.  Sounds like a deal!
1187	-1	This product, is an extremely poor version, compared to previous years. Downloads, are almost always compromised. Memorized transactions, are also not always remembered. I have, been a Quicken owner for over 15 years. THIS year's version is HORRIBLE.
1188	-1	Two changes happened over the past year, and Turbo Tax did a terrible job helping me with either.<br /><br />First, I moved from NY to DC. Turbo Tax did such a bad job splitting my income, and my return doesn't make sense. I don't think this is even correct. New York wouldn't even let me submit electronically because Turbo couldn't get the formatting right, I had to mail it.<br /><br />Second, my wife got a greencard. We got rejected twice because the IRS couldn't make the connection. I had to wait an hour on chat to ask someone what to do. The first time i missed the chat rep because there is no noise when the chat person messages you. Then, it took an hour for the rep to just tell me to print. So much wasted time!<br /><br />I really hate TurboTax and they don't really care about helping their customers. I wish I just used an accountant.
1189	1	2014 quicken caused me all sorts of problems and I just gave up on it towards the end of 2014. Quicken 2015 seems to be more stable so far. I have had a few issues with wrong info from bank and some credit cards. Time will tell if this is going to be better than other years although I must say I didn't have any issues with Quicken until 2014. All the previous version worked well for me.
1190	1	Simple to use and does just want I need.  Having everything categorized correctly will help tremendously with taxes next year.  I used to use a spreadsheet but this is so much better.
1191	1	Gave easy to follow directions It took you through both State and Federal in a step by step method and if you had questions it<br />it gave you understanable answers
1192	0	I've been using Quicken since it originally was introduced many years ago.  I appreciate being able to manage all my finances in a single place, download the transactions across all my accounts, and create reports that show how and where I spend my money.  However, what I don't appreciate is being pretty much forced to now upgrade Quicken on an annual basis, whether I want to or not.  I was running Quicken 2014, which I only installed about 6 months ago.  As usual, the endless reminders about needing to upgrade to Quicken 2015 started at the beginning of January.  Unchecking the dialog box that says, &#34;Remind me later.&#34; is meaningless, since the same dialog box will then come up each time you open Quicken, regardless of what you've checked.  Therefore, to stop that irritation, I went ahead and bought Quicken 2015, which looks pretty much like Quicken 2014 to me.  Which looked pretty much like Quicken 2013.  Intuit should just announce that Quicken is now an annual license and quit fooling around like this.<br /><br />Here's a useful tip for anyone that is planning to upgrade from Quicken 2014 to Quicken 2015.  If your Quicken password has special characters in it ($, #, @, etc.) CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD TO REMOVE THOSE CHARACTERS IN QUICKEN 2014 BEFORE YOU LOAD QUICKEN 2015!  Otherwise, during the installation of Quicken 2015, your Quicken 2014 installation will be completely removed.  You will then try to open your Quicken data file in Quicken 2015 and you will be told your password is invalid.  You will try it about 10 more times before you refer to the Intuit site for help.  You will then find a lot of useless posts on how to change your password on Intuit.com, but nowhere will you be told that the geniuses at Intuit forgot to make sure that Quicken 2015 can open a 2014 file secured by a password with special characters.  This same thing happened a couple years ago, so evidently their learning curve is low.  Your only option at that point appears to be to digout your copy of Quicken 2014, open your Quick data file, change your password to one without special characters, save the file, re-open the file successfully in Quicken 2015, then change your password back to something more secure that uses special characters.  That's super-convenient, isn't it?<br /><br />If you remove the special characters in your password BEFORE you start the installation of Quicken 2015, it should go pretty smoothly for you.
1193	1	I was able to catch the malicious software and others... Initially I had to run the full scan a few times since it doesn't catch all on the first run..in any case, my PC seems to be running better than before...quicker response and everything...
1194	0	Very basic.  Much cheaper than Quicken.  No frills.  Takes some getting used to.
1195	0	Would rate higher but &#34;upgrade&#34; notification pops up every time I launch and when you try to upgrade you receive message that this version not compatible for upgrade.
1196	0	Maybe I was oversold. Many people comment on Quicken and I see about half and half good and not so good comments. My salesperson was very high on Quicken which is just fine. I enjoy being able to have all finances in one spot. My biggest complaints are with the transferring from banks and other institutions. For some reason it will transfer transactions over twice. Not all if them but a good amount is transferred twice. It took a little bit to figure this out. Why aren't my balances equal and I know I didn't eat out or buy that stock more than once. I called the help desk about it and they said it was my institutions. I could buy that if it was just one. It was four. I asked for new software( maybe defective) I was told no. I thought there was a money back satisfaction thing or something. I was wrong. As of right now I'm not using it just going from website to website getting my info. Maybe someday!!!!
1197	0	I have used tax preparation software from both H&R Block and Intuit's TurboTax.  Each has their pros and cons.  I find the H&R Block package somewhat more awkward to use than TurboTax, but it provides at least one feature which TurboTax does not.  For our small business we need the ability to generate IRS 1098 and 1096 forms, which TurboTax does not support.  H&R Block's software does provide this ability, but it is tricky to access this ability without going through all the steps of filing a normal return.
1198	0	Background: I'm a long time quicken user and the last version I was using prior to this is 2012.<br /><br />This 2014 version offers very, very little improvements to the 2012 version that I was using. I should have listened to the reviews here and saved my money. In fact, I am so disappointed that I would like to give this review a one star but I know that's not fair to the product so I gave it a 3. I'm not sure why Quicken feels compelled to release a &#34;new&#34; version every year. Wait. Scratch that. I know why they release a &#34;new&#34; version every year. MONEY!<br /><br />On the other hand, had I been a first time quicken user, I would probably rate this version a five star.<br /><br />Hope this gives you some perspective.
1199	-1	Not helpful. Tried to return numerous times and could not! Very disappointed with the entire process and merchandise.
1200	-1	doesnt support wireless *face palm* tell people this before hand!
1201	0	This is for my son who is 3.5 yrs old.  The games are easy.  The games are short with simple rules.  Each game will only take a few minutes to complete.  The games are based on making choices to answer the questions.  Each game is only for one thing.  For example, a game may be for a specific color or shape.
1202	-1	Takes a lot of resources and slows down web browsing.<br />Will not renew subscription.<br /><br />Will be un-installing and will look for another anti virus solution.
1203	1	It has performed well.  It stopped 2 significant malware attacks.  I have not felt any slowdown in performance.  It works better than I expected.
1204	0	Program locks up constantly, not sure why, but needs to be updated. Also program does not default to current date automatically.
1205	0	ok
1206	0	Good program for free use. But at the same time with it installation has been downloaded unwanted software.
1207	-1	Never use again. Removed simply worksheet I needed. Wanted $30 more!!
1208	1	I strongly suggest you use Norton in place of any free anti-virus software you're using now. I recently had to clean a malware type of anti-virus program off of a friend's computer. It was a hassle. Stick with what works. I'm just saying...
1209	1	great tools for business .. keep improving pls
1210	1	I wanted to upgrade my ram to 24 gigs but Win 7 Home Premium will only allow 16 gigs. Fastest way to upgrade to Win 7 Professional is to buy upgrade at Amazon and almost instantly get upgrade code. The rest is really easy. Took about ten minutes.
1211	0	what does it mean when it says 1 user,3 licenses? Can i download this protection on my laptop and my daughters notebook?
1212	0	Loadable at least will not protect from malware, or Trojans.
1213	1	Did this in 2014 for our 13 year old daughter and she loved it.  Hid the notes in plastic easter eggs with some candy.
1214	0	This product on my computer crashes a lot.  It just closes itself.  Especially when trying to use premier elements to make slide show from pictures.  Even just adding titles to a slide show in elements  can crash,  I started saving after every change I make when creating a  slide show.  I have been using elements 9 and older photoshop for years with no problem. Probably something on my computer causes this, but adobe must be aware of something as their help information tells how to check for interfering programs by disabling start up programs and servicds using windows configurations features.  It helped a little bit, but interferes with normal computer operation.  Also it is a tremendous memory hog. I more than met the system requiremnets , but it still ran out of mememory.  I added 4 more GB to my system and it still fails when processing DVD's.
1215	1	I have used Microsoft Money for many years and needed to finally move to something else since it has been discontinued. I was able to import from Money into Quicken easily and near 100% accurate. The only issue I have found is the due date on some bills are off a couple of days. All of my accounts with transactions, categories and recurring bills were imported. I am even finding it easier to use. Definitely recommending.
1216	0	easy to use.  Could use some added options to enable better choices of sort and print.  Also would be nice to copy the checkbook into another checkbook on a different computer in a different location.  I needed to have this feature as I was traveling/
1217	0	Can't be used on older models
1218	1	Office for Mac has never been as user friendly in a seamless way as the PC version is. However, this version is much improved over the 2004 I had for many years. The only problem I had was that the download version would not download, and it wasn't until I went through my Apple Care people, who sent me to Microsoft for Mac people, that the problem was resolved. I had to recently upgrade my OS on my iMac to 10.8.4 to enable my iPad and my iPhone 5 cloud services to sync with it, which then wiped out my Office. Apple didn't bother to tell me that would happen...oh well. I must say that the service I received from the Microsoft people( in the Philippines no less!), to resolve my problem was the best I have ever had from Microsoft; period. They were courteous and patient even though it took a whole hour to figure a solution out. It was determined that Safari did not like the new OS for this particular task. The fix was to install Firefox just for this occasion...whoda thunk that?????  Now, it works great and at least Word is easier to negotiate than the old  version. The jury is still out on Excel...time will tell.
1219	1	I needed Word, I got Word. Piece of cake. It'd be five stars if they offered it a la carte. I don't in any way, shape, or form need Excel, Outlook, and that other stuff.
1220	1	k
1221	1	Excellent price. Great program, easy to use. So much better than the alternatives!
1222	-1	If you are looking for payroll assistance as this is touted forget it. Intuit took it out and you have to buy the 2012 version or sign up for their online payroll services.  The description should say &#34;we screwed up our product to make you spend more money.<br /><br />The rich part is that Intuit wants me to wait four weeks for my refund even though they know there is a huge problem with this product evidenced by their refund call center not bothering to say hello.  Nope, they answered &#34;You Want A Refund On Quickbooks 2013?&#34; as if Intuit has no other products. As for waiting a month for my money.  A big no.  That's why I use American Express and Amazon.
1223	1	I bought this software here because it was much less expensive than buying from the CyberLink site. And the software here was not as bloated as it is from CyberLink. My use for this software is only for Blu-ray DVD playback on my pc..so watch the windows when you install this and un-click what you don't want...very simple and it will not &#34;invade&#34; your pc. If you don't want it taking memory when not in use just go to the task manager and end the process. It is very good at what it's purpose is...playing videos most amazingly clearly and sharply with great 5-1 or 7-1 sound. I have used this since the PowerDVD version 5 and have very few complaints and most of those small issues were user-caused. 4 stars because there is no perfect software and never will be.
1224	1	Great for day today banking needs, keeps your checkbook current, and is easy to navigate. Wish I could use it on my kindle. Going to look into that.
1225	1	its good.
1226	0	It says easy to use,I am finding it is difficult and confusing to use and is NOT user friendly. It is a struggle just to get it to do what you think it should.
1227	0	Difficult to use if you have K-1 forms to enter, especially if they include income from multiple foreign countries.  Overall, it is not intuitive and the instructions are vague. On the community help site, questions other than very simple ones seem to go unanswered - guess no one has a clue how the software works.
1228	0	Another year of TurboTax and another tax year completed.  I know a lot of users were upset with TurboTax this year and I agree that Intuit should not have done what they did, but I did NOT need those functions and it worked just fine for me.  The only thing that upsets me is what it costs to file the state return electronically.  It should not cost more than $5 to do so.  It is a ripoff in my opinion to charge to much to file electronically which should save the state money from mailing it in.  Just my two cents worth.
1229	1	Best price I found on the internet.
1230	0	The clip art is more for a 5 - 10 year old to use.  Not for adults.  If I would have known what it really came with, I wouldn't have bought it.  $10 is too much for this.  I stupidly paid $40.
1231	1	I have used Quicken for years and this version does not disappoint!  I recommend it to anyone who wants to easily track their finances.
1232	1	Been using H&R Block software to prepare our Federal Income Tax for years. On those rare occasions when I had a question, they had clear  answer right now!!
1233	0	seems a little better than avg.Still have to do a lot of own work.Also WHY DO I HAVE TO get new subscription instead of renewal to get best price???????
1234	0	While Quicken for Mac 2015 is better than prior MAC versions of Quicken, it is not as good as the Windows version. It lacks or obscures some essential features such as automatic bill pay and mortgages. In addition, if you have been a Quicken on Windows user, you need to run a Windows based conversion program to import that data to the Mac. I am very disappointed that the file formats are not the same on Windows and Macs so that the data could be shared without conversion. One of Intuit's other important applications, TurboTax, is interoperable and compatible between Macs and Windows - so they have the &#34;technical chops&#34; to do it.<br />I have had it for a few months and much to my surprise it has only crashed once.
1235	0	Bought the version with state included, but nearing the end of the process was told that I would again have to pay to file for state. Other than that it's a decent product.
1236	0	It's an OK program but did generate a completely false error message preventing Efile.  Turns out Efile is not possible for expats, but not for the reason displayed on the screen (garbage about a missing phone number which the program would not let me correct).  Waited over ½ for either phone or 'chat' support (phone never picked up) and 'chat' rep didn't know the reason.  Discovered it myself.  Cheaper than TurboTax, but at what price?
1237	0	A lot of bugs - crashes a lot. Definitely does not like windows 8.1.  Intuit is getting lax in quality.
1238	-1	As a new Quicken user I'm disappointed. I purchased Quicken Premier excited to have automatic updates from all of our bank, investment, and mortgage accounts in one place. Quicken fails miserably - it doesn't support automatic updates from several of our accounts with major companies like Bank of America and Ameriprise. Looks like I get to login to each account and then manually update Quicken every time I want my info to be accurate. I don't come from an accounting background and was also hoping for a uncomplicated, user-friendly interface. Quicken fails again, it isn't intuitive at all. The silver lining is that the numerous issues I'm having appear to be widespread. If I can't figure something out, there are plenty of other users who've already had the same problem and posted their solutions on the community help forum.<br /><br />Interestingly, Mint.com which is free has no issues at all providing automatic updates for each of our accounts.
1239	-1	DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!  I regret that I purchased this product very much. After only a few months it stopped working. That's fine, software can develop glitches. I have no problem with that. However, Cyberlink's tech support is practically impossible to work with. There is no phone support and the email support is extremely slow in responding. That's not the worst part. They require more information in these ensuing emails than an IRS audit. No one in their right mind would spend hours replying to all their demands. For God's sake, just look up my purchase order number! There are several great competitors out there.
1240	-1	This is not approved software so it will not download on a Mac.
1241	0	Will go with a different virus protection next time
1242	0	I upgraded from 2013 to 2014.  2013 was a better product. Getting the font size to work for me was different, I found the Larger font size worked better than not using it however the check Register and Credid card Register was way Too large. The Quicken Cloud is the only new feature I checked it out but I am happy using quicken at my desktop.<br />I feel like I got nothing for my upgrade Fee. and it is less friendly<br />James Bettis
1243	1	everything ok!!<br />very good product and very strong protection that this software provides!<br />the download speed was very fast !
1244	0	I appreciate my accounts syncing to my iPhone 6 - along with the free Mobile App that works with the Desktop version. There are some quirkiness when updating my credit card / debit card accounts. For example, I get error messages alluding to syncing or not being able to connect to a certain bank. The issue is not necessarily with Quicken but the banks themselves as they implement security measures such as typing a captcha code periodically. I appreciate the security but it does detract from the seamlessness of updating my accounts. Another quirk is when I do manually input a record, for example, and I download the latest transactions, about half the time they don't match or reconcile properly. Overall, the idea is there, the implementation is not. Hence the 3 star rating.
1245	0	It is totally different from my previous quicken and I find myself getting very frustrated.  Wish it came with a phone number to call for support.
